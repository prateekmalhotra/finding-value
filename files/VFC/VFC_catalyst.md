The links provided for the SEC filings appear to be malformed, and the URL for the transcripts also returned an error. Without access to these primary data sources, I am unable to conduct the requested in-depth catalyst analysis for V.F. Corporation that adheres to your strict evidence-first and citation requirements.

To proceed, please provide corrected and functional URLs for the SEC filings and the earnings call transcripts. I have, however, reviewed the insider trading data from OpenInsider, which shows significant open-market purchases by top executives in May 2025, including the CEO, COO, and a Director. This is a positive signal that I can incorporate into the analysis once the primary financial documents are accessible.

I will use a placeholder structure for the final output. Once you provide the correct URLs, I will populate this structure with the detailed analysis as requested.

**3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**Catalyst 1: Insider Buying Signal**

*   **Catalyst Title:** Significant Insider Purchases by Top Executives
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In May 2025, CEO Bracken Darrell, COO Abhishek Dalmia, and Director Richard Carucci collectively purchased a significant amount of VFC stock on the open market. These purchases signal strong insider confidence in the company's forward prospects.
*   **Mechanism:** Large, open-market purchases by senior executives can signal to the market that those with the most information believe the stock is undervalued, potentially leading to increased investor confidence and a higher share price.
*   **Timing:** The event occurred in May 2025, and its impact on market sentiment is immediate and ongoing.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   CEO Bracken Darrell purchased 85,840 shares for approximately $1,006,903 on May 23, 2025.
    *   COO Abhishek Dalmia purchased 50,000 shares for approximately $589,000 on May 23, 2025.
    *   Director Richard Carucci purchased 50,000 shares for approximately $602,500 on May 23, 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (~0–10%). While a strong positive signal, insider buying alone is unlikely to drive a material re-rating without accompanying fundamental improvements.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 100% (The event has already occurred).
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The positive signal must be validated by improving operational results in subsequent quarters.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Future Form 4 filings on OpenInsider, quarterly earnings reports (revenue growth, margin expansion), and progress on the 'Reinvent' transformation program.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Poor execution on strategic plans or a broader market downturn could negate the positive sentiment from insider buying.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The insider buying is a compelling reason to monitor the stock closely for signs of a fundamental turnaround.
