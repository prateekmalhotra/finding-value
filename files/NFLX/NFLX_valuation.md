Of course. This is an excellent and well-structured valuation analysis. You've correctly identified the key value drivers and laid out your assumptions clearly. However, there are a few critical methodological and assumption-based issues that, when corrected, will lead to a more robust and realistic valuation.

Here is a critique of the original analysis, followed by a revised valuation that corrects these issues while maintaining your original format.

### **Critique of the Original Valuation**

1.  **FCFF Formula & Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** The formula used, `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`, incorrectly double-penalizes the company for stock-based compensation. SBC is a non-cash expense that is already deducted from revenue to arrive at EBIT. By subtracting it again from NOPAT (EBIT * (1-t)), you are effectively counting the expense twice. The standard approach is to use `FCFF = NOPAT + D&A - Capex - Change in NWC`. The dilutive effect of SBC is correctly handled by using the diluted share count in the final per-share calculation.
2.  **Terminal Value Assumption:** The user-identified key point of concern. An implied 11.1x EV/EBITDA multiple for a mature Netflix in 2030 is arguably too conservative. While it's not a pure-play tech company, its high margins, global scale, and subscription revenue model would likely command a higher multiple than a traditional media company. A multiple more in line with a mature, high-margin consumer staples or platform business (e.g., 13x-15x) would be more realistic for a base case.
3.  **Per-Share Value Calculation:** The analysis calculates the present value of the company *today* but divides it by a projected, smaller share count from *five years in the future* (404.98M). This is a methodological error. The value derived from a DCF is the intrinsic value *at the time of the analysis*. Therefore, it must be divided by the *current* diluted shares outstanding (436.96M). The value of future buybacks is captured by the cash leaving the firm, not by an artificial reduction of the denominator for a present value calculation.
4.  **Tax Rate Assumption:** The 13.0% tax rate is very low for a company with significant US operations. The statutory US federal rate is 21%, plus state taxes. While Netflix benefits from international tax structures, a normalized long-term rate of 17-20% is more defensible and less aggressive.

Here is the revised intrinsic valuation analysis with these corrections implemented.

### **Company:** Netflix, Inc. (NFLX)
### **Currency:** USD (in millions, unless otherwise noted)
### **Date of Analysis:** August 23, 2025
### **Primary Sources Reviewed:**
*   Netflix, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, filed April 18, 2025

## **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

*(This section from the original analysis is well-executed and remains unchanged. It provides a valuable baseline for what the market is pricing in.)*

#### **A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

**1) Current Market Price:**
*   **$1,204.65 per share** (at close, August 22, 2025).

**2) Baseline Financials (TTM - Trailing Twelve Months ended June 30, 2025):**
*(All data points from the original analysis are carried over.)*

#### **B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

*   **WACC Calculation (for Market View):** **9.92%** *(Calculation from the original analysis is sound.)*

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
Using the baseline financials, a 9.92% WACC, and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, the market price of $1,204.65 implies the following performance over the next five years:

> **A 5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 14.5% and a stable TTM operating margin of 29.5%.**

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify today's stock price, an investor must believe Netflix can grow its revenue by nearly 15% annually for the next five years while maintaining its historically high current operating margins.

## **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on revised, evidence-based assumptions.

#### **C) Formulate Realistic Assumptions (5 Years)**

**6) Critical Review of Market Assumptions:**
*(The original critical review remains valid.)*

**7) Revenue for Years 1–5:**
*   **Justification:** The original tapering growth model is a realistic and prudent approach. It acknowledges near-term strength while respecting the law of large numbers.
*   **Assumption:** Revenue growth will start at **13.0% in Year 1** and decline by 2.0% each year to **5.0% in Year 5.** *(Unchanged)*

**8) Margin Path:**
*   **Justification:** The original margin expansion path reflects management's stated goals and execution capabilities, while capping the upside due to competitive reality.
*   **Assumption:** Operating margin will be **30.0% in Year 1** and expand by 50 basis points annually to **32.0% in Year 5.** *(Unchanged)*

**9) Taxes (Revised):**
*   **Justification:** The original 13.0% assumption is too low for the long term. A higher normalized rate better reflects global tax obligations, including a 21% US statutory rate.
*   **Assumption:** A normalized effective tax rate of **18.0%** throughout the forecast period.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex & Working Capital:** The original assumptions are reasonable and based on historicals.
    *   **Assumption:** Capex will remain at **1.5% of revenue.** Change in NWC will be **-1.5% of incremental revenue.** *(Unchanged)*

**11) Share Count:**
*   **Assumption:** We will use the **current diluted weighted-average shares outstanding** for the final per-share calculation, as this correctly reflects the present value per share today. Future buybacks are a use of cash, not a denominator adjustment for a present value.

#### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction (Revised)**

**12) Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):**
*   **Formula (Corrected):** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in NWC
*   **Rationale:** This standard formula correctly calculates cash flow available to all capital providers. It starts with after-tax operating profit (NOPAT) and adjusts for non-cash items and investments.

**FCFF Forecast (USD, millions):**
| Year | 1 (2026E) | 2 (2027E) | 3 (2028E) | 4 (2029E) | 5 (2030E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $47,111 | $52,039 | $56,722 | $60,693 | $63,728 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *13.0%* | *10.5%* | *9.0%* | *7.0%* | *5.0%* |
| EBIT | $14,133 | $16,132 | $17,868 | $19,422 | $20,393 |
| *Operating Margin* | *30.0%* | *31.0%* | *31.5%* | *32.0%* | *32.0%* |
| EBIT * (1-t) | $11,590 | $13,228 | $14,652 | $15,926 | $16,722 |
| \+ D&A | $363 | $401 | $437 | $468 | $491 |
| \- Capex | ($707) | ($781) | ($851) | ($910) | ($956) |
| \- Change in NWC | ($81) | ($74) | ($70) | ($60) | ($46) |
| **FCFF** | **$11,165** | **$12,774** | **$14,168** | **$15,424** | **$16,211** |

#### **E) Discount Rate (WACC) (Revised)**

**13) Analyst's WACC:** The WACC should reflect the forward-looking tax rate used in the forecast.
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM): 10.21%** *(Unchanged)*
*   **Cost of Debt (after-tax) (Revised):**
    *   Pre-tax Cost of Debt: ~4.96%
    *   Revised Tax Rate: 18.0%
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 4.96% * (1 - 0.18) = **4.07%**
*   **WACC (Revised):**
    *   Market Cap (E) = $526,375M; Debt (D) = $15,017M
    *   WACC = ($526,375 / $541,392) * 10.21% + ($15,017 / $541,392) * 4.07% = **10.04%**

#### **F) Terminal Value (Revised)**

**14) Exit Multiple Method:**
*   **Justification:** For a company like Netflix, an exit multiple is often more stable and reflective of market sentiment than a perpetuity growth rate, which can be highly sensitive to small changes. We will use a terminal EV/EBITDA multiple that reflects a mature, high-margin, market-leading business.
*   **Assumption:** A terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of **14.0x**. This is higher than traditional media but below the peak multiples of high-growth tech, representing a realistic state for a mature Netflix.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $20,393M + $491M = $20,884M
    *   Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * 14.0 = $20,884M * 14.0 = **$292,376M**

**15) Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
*   **Implied Growth Rate (g):** We can calculate the growth rate implied by our 14.0x multiple.
    *   Implied g = WACC - (FCFF_Yr5 * (1+g)) / Terminal Value. A simpler calculation is `g = WACC - (FCFF_Yr6 / TV)`.
    *   Assuming FCFF_Yr6 grows at `g`, the formula is `g = (TV * WACC - FCFF_5) / (TV + FCFF_5)`.
    *   g = ($292,376 * 10.04% - $16,211) / ($292,376 + $16,211) ≈ **4.25%**
*   **Reasoning:** An implied perpetual growth rate of 4.25% is aggressive and likely exceeds long-term global GDP growth. This indicates that a 14.0x multiple is a bullish but plausible scenario, making it a suitable base case rather than an overly conservative one. For our valuation, we will stick with the Exit Multiple calculation but acknowledge its optimistic embedded growth assumption.

#### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

**16) Enterprise Value (EV):**
*   PV of FCFF (Years 1-5) @ 10.04% = $10,146 + $10,554 + $10,655 + $10,563 + $10,088 = **$52,006M**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $292,376 / (1 + 0.1004)^5 = **$181,960M**
*   **Total Enterprise Value = $52,006M + $181,960M = $233,966M**

**17) Equity Value:**
*   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
*   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $15,017M - $7,200M = $7,817M
*   **Equity Value = $233,966M - $7,817M = $226,149M**

#### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

**18) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   Current Diluted Weighted-Average Shares: **436.96M**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $226,149M / 436.96M = $517.55**

**19) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $517.55.** Assumes 13% revenue growth tapering to 5%, margins expanding to 32%, and a 14.0x terminal multiple.
*   **Low/Bear Case: ~$400.** Assumes lower revenue growth (10% tapering to 4%), margin compression to 29%, and a 12.0x terminal multiple.
*   **High/Bull Case: ~$650.** Assumes sustained revenue growth above 14%, faster margin expansion to 34%, and a 16.0x terminal multiple.

**20) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 25% margin of safety from the base-case estimate provides a buffer for estimation errors and unforeseen risks.
*   **MOS Price = $517.55 * (1 - 0.25) = $388.16**

### **Risk Notes**
*(The original risk notes are comprehensive and remain fully relevant.)*
1.  **Competition:** Intense competition from Disney+, Amazon Prime, Warner Bros. Discovery, and others could pressure subscriber growth and pricing power.
2.  **Content Pipeline Risk:** The business relies on a consistent stream of hit content.
3.  **Password Sharing & Pricing:** Risk of consumer fatigue or reaching a price ceiling.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** Increased scrutiny in international markets regarding local content quotas and taxation.
