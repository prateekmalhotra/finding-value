Synthesis:
Salesforce exhibits many of the characteristics of a high-quality growth company according to Philip A. Fisher's 15-point checklist. The company's strengths lie in its strong market position, commitment to innovation, robust sales organization, and improving profitability. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful integration of its recent acquisitions, particularly the large acquisition of Informatica, and the continued adoption and monetization of its AI and Data Cloud offerings. A successful integration of Informatica would solidify a "Yes" for point 2, while a failure to monetize its AI offerings could call into question the effectiveness of its R&D spending (point 3).

fisher score is 15 / 15
