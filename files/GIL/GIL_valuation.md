### **6) Discount Rate**

*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.3% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, August 20, 2025)
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** 6.0% (Conservative estimate)
*   **Beta:** 1.0 (Conservative assumption for a cyclical industry)
*   **Cost of Equity:** 4.3% + 1.0 * 6.0% = 10.3%
*   **Cost of Debt (pre-tax):** 5.5% (Inferred from financials with a conservative spread)
*   **WACC:** 9.0% (Calculated based on market cap and total debt)

### **7) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0% (Conservative, below long-term inflation)
    *   **Terminal Value:** (514.4 * (1 + 0.02)) / (0.09 - 0.02) = **$7,495M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $905.8M (EBIT + D&A)
    *   **Exit Multiple:** 10.0x (Conservative multiple for the apparel industry)
    *   **Terminal Value (Multiple):** 905.8 * 10.0 = **$9,058M**
    *   The Gordon Growth method is more conservative and will be used.

### **10) One-paragraph Risk Notes**

The key risks to this valuation are: 1) a downturn in consumer discretionary spending, which would negatively impact revenue growth; 2) significant fluctuations in cotton and other raw material prices, which could compress margins; 3) increased competition in the basic apparel market, leading to pricing pressure; and 4) failure to successfully integrate any large acquisitions, such as the proposed combination with HanesBrands, which could lead to synergies not being realized and increased debt levels.

final answer is 30.89 $
