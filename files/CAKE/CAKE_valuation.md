| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth (Y1) | 4.0% | Based on the midpoint of management's FY2025 revenue guidance of $3.76 billion, representing a 4.0% increase over LTM revenue. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, July 29, 2025) |
| Revenue Growth (Y2-5) | 3.5% | A blend of historical performance and planned unit growth, tapering slightly from the guided growth rate. |
| Operating Margin (EBIT) | 5.5% | Stable margin assumed, reflecting the average of the last three fiscal years, adjusted for one-time impairments. (10-K, Feb. 24, 2025) |
| Tax Rate | 21.0% | Normalized US federal and state statutory corporate tax rate. |
| Capex as % of Revenue | 5.3% | Based on the midpoint of management's 2025 capex guidance ($200M) as a percentage of guided revenue. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, July 29, 2025) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:**
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**

| Year | 1 (2025E) | 2 (2026E) | 3 (2027E) | 4 (2028E) | 5 (2029E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,762.4 | $3,894.1 | $4,030.4 | $4,171.5 | $4,317.5 |
| EBIT (5.5%) | $206.9 | $214.2 | $221.7 | $229.4 | $237.5 |
| NOPAT | $163.5 | $169.2 | $175.1 | $181.3 | $187.6 |
| D&A | $107.0 | $110.7 | $114.6 | $118.6 | $122.8 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($30.1) | ($31.2) | ($32.2) | ($33.4) | ($34.5) |
| Capex | ($200.0) | ($206.9) | ($214.1) | ($221.6) | ($229.4) |
| Change in WC | ($2.9) | ($2.6) | ($2.7) | ($2.8) | ($2.9) |
| **FCFF** | **$37.5** | **$39.2** | **$40.7** | **$42.1** | **$43.6** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | Current yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond. (August 21, 2025) |
| Beta (5-Year) | 1.16 | Reflects the stock's volatility relative to the market. (StockAnalysis, August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **10.09%** | `Formula: Rf + Beta * ERP = 4.29% + 1.16 * 5.0%` |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 5.5% | Estimated based on the company's credit facility terms. |
| Tax Rate | 21.0% | Normalized statutory rate. |
| **After-Tax Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **4.35%** | `Formula: Pre-Tax Kd * (1 - Tax Rate) = 5.5% * (1 - 0.21)` |
| Market Cap (E) | $3,104M | (Share Price as of Aug 2025 * Diluted Shares) |
| Net Debt (D) | $508.6M | (Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents) |
| **WACC** | **9.10%** | `Formula: (E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd` |

### **F) Terminal Value**

The Gordon Growth method is used to calculate the terminal value, with a conservative perpetual growth rate.

*   **Terminal FCFF (Year 6):** $43.6M * (1 + 2.5%) = $44.7M
*   **Perpetual Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Assumed to be in line with long-term inflation expectations)
*   **Terminal Value Formula:** `(Terminal FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
*   **Terminal Value Calculation:** `$44.7M / (9.10% - 2.5%) = $677.3M`

**Cross-Check (Exit Multiple Method):**
*   LTM EBITDA = EBIT ($191.0M) + D&A ($102.8M) = $293.8M
*   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT ($237.5M) + D&A ($122.8M) = $360.3M
*   Current EV/EBITDA Multiple = ($3,104M + $508.6M) / $293.8M = 12.3x
*   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple): $360.3M * 10.0x (Assumed historical median) = $3,603M
*   **Note:** There is a significant discrepancy. The Gordon Growth method is more conservative and will be used as the base case.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) | $158.4M |
| PV of Terminal Value | $439.0M |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$597.4M** |
| Less: Net Debt | ($508.6M) |
| **Equity Value** | **$88.8M** |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value Calculation:** `$88.8M / 49.284M shares = $1.80`
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% discount):** `$1.80 * (1 - 0.30) = $1.26`

**Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $1.80:** Assumes moderate growth and stable margins.
*   **Low/Bear Case: ~$1.00:** Assumes lower revenue growth (2.5%) and margin compression to 4.5% due to increased competition and cost pressures.
*   **High/Bull Case: ~$3.50:** Assumes higher revenue growth (5.0%) driven by successful unit expansion and margin expansion to 6.5% from operational efficiencies.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Margin Pressure:** The restaurant industry is highly competitive, and CAKE faces significant pressure on margins from food commodity inflation and rising labor costs. Failure to offset these costs through pricing or efficiency could compress profitability.
2.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** As a casual dining restaurant, CAKE is sensitive to changes in consumer discretionary spending, which can be impacted by macroeconomic factors like inflation, interest rates, and unemployment.
3.  **Competition and Traffic:** The company competes with a wide range of national and local restaurants. Maintaining customer traffic and market share requires continuous menu innovation and a consistently positive guest experience.
4.  **Growth Execution:** The company's growth strategy relies on successfully opening new restaurant locations for its various concepts. Delays in site selection, permitting, or construction, as well as underperformance of new units, could hinder growth targets.
5.  **Debt and Capital Structure:** The company's use of convertible debt introduces complexity, and its overall debt level requires prudent capital management, especially in a rising interest rate environment.

final answer is 1.80 $
