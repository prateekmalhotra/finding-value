**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The U.S. outpatient rehabilitation market is large and fragmented, estimated at over $40 billion. USPH is one of the largest operators but holds less than 10% market share, providing significant consolidation opportunity. Favorable demographic trends, including an aging and more physically active population, are expected to drive sustained demand for physical therapy services. The company's growth in the industrial injury prevention (IIP) services segment, which saw 22.6% revenue growth in Q2 2025, provides a complementary and expanding revenue stream.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's development strategy is focused on expanding its clinic footprint and service offerings rather than creating new products. This is executed through a disciplined M&A strategy, exemplified by the significant Metro acquisition in New York, and opening new "de novo" clinics. In Q2 2025, physical therapy revenues grew 17.3%, largely driven by acquisitions. The company is also investing in technology, such as a new applicant tracking system and exploring AI-driven documentation, to improve processes and support scalability.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a healthcare services provider, USPH does not have a traditional R&D function focused on product development or patents. Its innovation is centered on process improvements, clinical protocols, and business development. While the company invests in systems for finance, HR, and recruiting, these are operational expenses, not R&D. There is no evidence of a formal R&D budget or department.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In this industry, "sales" are driven by clinical reputation, physician referrals, and patient satisfaction. USPH excels here, achieving a company record 32.7 average visits per clinic per day in Q2 2025. Management also reported a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 93.5, indicating exceptionally high patient loyalty and willingness to refer others. This strong performance, translating directly to volume growth, serves as evidence of a highly effective, albeit non-traditional, sales function.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates strong and improving profitability. In the second quarter of 2025, the physical therapy margin improved to 21.1%, up from 20.1% in the prior year's quarter. The industrial injury prevention segment reported a margin of 22.0%, up from 21.4%. Overall adjusted EBITDA margin expanded to 17.5% from 16.4% year-over-year, indicating solid profitability for a provider in this space.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on cost control and efficiency. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, they highlighted that the total operating cost per visit decreased year-over-year despite inflationary pressures. The company is also focused on "rate-enhancing initiatives" to secure better terms with payers. Furthermore, the growth of the higher-margin IIP business and the disciplined integration of acquisitions contribute positively to the overall margin profile.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The evidence on labor relations is mixed. On the positive side, the company invested in a new applicant tracking system in 2024 to improve recruiting and build a candidate database. However, management also noted that same-store growth was impacted by "staffing constraints in certain markets," indicating challenges in hiring or retention. Given that staffing is an acknowledged headwind, it is difficult to conclude that relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable and long-tenured. The Q2 2025 earnings call was led by Chairman & CEO Christopher Reading, with participation from the CFO and two COOs, demonstrating a consistent leadership group. There are no recent reports of high-level executive turnover or disputes. The company's consistent strategy and execution suggest a well-aligned and functioning senior team.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, USPH demonstrates significant management depth. The Q2 2025 earnings call featured not only the CEO and CFO but also Eric Williams (President & COO, East) and Graham Reeve (COO, West), in addition to the General Counsel and SVP of Accounting. This structure, with distinct operational leaders for different geographies, shows a deep bench of senior executives responsible for key business functions and regions, mitigating key-person risk at the CEO level.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management exhibits a strong command of its cost structure. In their Q2 2025 discussion, they provided granular detail on metrics such as cost per visit, salaries and related costs as a percentage of revenue, and margins by segment. The ability to report that total operating cost per visit declined year-over-year points to robust tracking and control systems. There is no history of material weaknesses or financial restatements in recent filings.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** USPH's partnership model is a key competitive advantage in the fragmented physical therapy industry. By allowing selling clinicians to retain a minority equity stake in their practices, USPH aligns incentives, improves therapist retention, and creates a more attractive exit opportunity for practice owners compared to a full buyout. This model fuels its successful acquisition strategy and helps maintain clinical quality.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management balances near-term execution with long-term investment. Their consistent strategy of growth through both acquisitions and de novo openings, which require upfront investment and time to mature, demonstrates a long-range outlook. In the Q2 2025 call, the company raised its full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance, reflecting confidence in its current operations, while continuing to invest in new clinics and systems for future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong. As of June 30, 2025, USPH had $34.1 million in cash and a manageable debt structure with a fixed interest rate on its term loan. Crucially, the Board of Directors authorized a $25 million share repurchase program in August 2025, signaling that management believes the stock is a good value and that dilution is not a concern. Growth is funded via operating cash flow and debt capacity, not dilutive equity raises.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, alongside record results, they openly discussed challenges. These included the negative impact of Medicare rate reductions, lighter-than-expected same-store growth due to staffing constraints, and a negative rate impact from a specific payer policy change in Michigan. This willingness to transparently discuss headwinds inspires confidence.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no red flags to suggest a lack of integrity. A review of news, financial reports, and SEC filings does not reveal any significant legal disputes, regulatory actions, or related-party transactions that would call management's integrity into question. The company's transparent financial reporting and candid communication with investors further support a positive assessment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** N/A (Based on absence of negative findings in reviewed sources)

**Synthesis:**
U.S. Physical Therapy scores well against Fisher's framework, exhibiting the hallmarks of a well-managed company in a favorable market. Its primary strengths lie in its long growth runway within a fragmented industry, a proven partnership-driven M&A model, strong and improving profit margins, and a deep, candid management team. The balance sheet is healthy, underscored by a new share repurchase authorization. The primary variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months hinge on labor and reimbursement. A resolution to the "staffing constraints" mentioned by management would flip point #7 to "Yes." Conversely, further significant Medicare rate cuts or commercial payer pressure could threaten margin assumptions and call into question the long-range profit outlook. To improve the score, investors would need to see concrete evidence of improved staff retention and successful navigation of the complex reimbursement environment.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
