Of course. Here is a critical review and revised valuation of Service Corporation International (SCI). The original analysis was well-structured, but contained a few flawed or overly conservative assumptions that can be improved for greater accuracy and realism.

The primary issues identified were:
1.  **Cost of Debt Calculation:** The original used the historical effective interest rate (`Interest Expense / Debt`), which reflects past conditions. A forward-looking valuation should use the *marginal* cost of new debt, which is typically higher and better reflects current market conditions and risk.
2.  **Terminal Value Assumption:** The original valuation noted that its Gordon Growth terminal value implied an exit multiple (10.8x EV/EBITDA) at the low end of the company's historical range. This is an unnecessarily conservative assumption for a stable, market-leading business. A valuation aiming for realism should use a multiple closer to the historical midpoint.
3.  **Clarity on Assumptions:** The Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) assumption was used in the table but not explicitly stated in the assumptions list, which is a minor clarity issue.

The following revised valuation corrects these points, primarily by using a more appropriate cost of debt and a more realistic terminal value based on a justified exit multiple.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are embedded in the current stock price.

**A) Current Market Price & Baseline Financials**

*   **Current Market Price:** **$81.50** (as of market close, August 22, 2025).

**Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2025)**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,247 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Gross Margin | 26.41% | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $949.2 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |

**B) Market's Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current enterprise value of **$16,615 million** (calculated as $81.50 price \* 145.2M shares + $5,038M debt - $255.4M cash), the market must believe SCI can achieve specific growth and profitability.

Using the baseline financials, a WACC of 7.13%, and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, the market is pricing in a **revenue growth rate of approximately 8.0% annually for the next five years**, assuming the TTM operating margin of 22.4% remains constant.

*   **Market-Implied Assumption:** A belief that SCI can grow revenue at an **8.0% CAGR** for the next five years, a rate significantly higher than recent history and management's guidance.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on revised, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) Forecast & Assumptions with Rationale**

My assumptions deviate from the market-implied view, leaning towards a realistic outlook grounded in management commentary, historical performance, and forward-looking market data.

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** The market's 8.0% implied growth appears overly optimistic. I will model **4.0% revenue growth for years 1-2, tapering to 3.5% in year 3, and 3.0% for years 4-5.** This aligns with management's "low to mid-single digit" guidance and historical norms for a mature industry.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM margin is 22.4%, and the 3-year average is 22.5%. Lacking specific guidance for significant margin expansion, I will hold the **operating margin stable at 22.5%** through the forecast period.
*   **Taxes:** The 3-year average effective tax rate is 24.1%. I assume a normalized effective tax rate of **24.0%**.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **D&A:** Historically, D&A has been ~8.0% of revenue. This will be modeled as **8.0% of annual revenue.**
    *   **Capex:** Historically, capex has averaged ~9.0% of revenue. I will project **capex at 9.0% of annual revenue.**
    *   **Working Capital:** I will model the change in working capital as **5.0% of the change in revenue**, a conservative estimate based on historical volatility.
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:** I will treat SBC as a real cash expense. Based on the company's strong history of buybacks ($401M in the TTM), I project a net **2.0% annual reduction in diluted shares outstanding**, balancing repurchases against SBC issuance.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,416.9 | $4,593.6 | $4,754.3 | $4,896.9 | $5,043.9 |
| *Growth Rate* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* | *3.5%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* |
| EBIT (22.5% of Revenue) | $993.8 | $1,033.6 | $1,069.7 | $1,101.8 | $1,134.9 |
| Tax on EBIT (24.0%) | ($238.5) | ($248.1) | ($256.7) | ($264.4) | ($272.4) |
| **NOPAT** | **$755.3** | **$785.5** | **$813.0** | **$837.4** | **$862.5** |
| D&A (8.0% of Revenue) | $353.4 | $367.5 | $380.3 | $391.8 | $403.5 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($17.5) | ($17.8) | ($18.2) | ($18.6) | ($19.0) |
| Capex (9.0% of Revenue) | ($397.5) | ($413.4) | ($427.9) | ($440.7) | ($454.0) |
| Change in WC | ($8.5) | ($8.8) | ($8.0) | ($7.1) | ($7.4) |
| **FCFF** | **$685.2** | **$713.0** | **$739.2** | **$762.8** | **$785.6** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC) - Revised**

*   **Cost of Equity (Ke):** 8.81%
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.26% (Source: US 10-Year Treasury, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium (ERP): 5.0% (Standard assumption)
    *   Levered Beta: 0.91 (Source: Market data) - Justification: Beta below 1.0 reflects a defensive, non-cyclical business.
*   **Cost of Debt (Kd):** 4.56% (after-tax)
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt: 6.00%** - **(Correction)** This is revised from the original. Instead of using the historical effective rate, this assumes a forward-looking marginal cost of debt for an investment-grade company like SCI, estimated as the risk-free rate (4.26%) plus a credit spread of ~1.74%.
    *   Tax Rate: 24.0%
*   **WACC:** **7.54%**
    *   Weight of Equity: 70.1% (Market Cap / (Market Cap + Total Debt))
    *   Weight of Debt: 29.9% (Debt / (Market Cap + Total Debt))
    *   Formula: WACC = (Weight of Equity \* Cost of Equity) + (Weight of Debt \* Pre-Tax Cost of Debt \* (1 - Tax Rate))
    *   WACC = (0.701 \* 8.81%) + (0.299 \* 6.00% \* (1 - 0.24)) = 6.18% + 1.36% = 7.54%

**F) Terminal Value - Revised**

*   **Exit Multiple Method:** A terminal value based on a sustainable, long-term multiple is more appropriate here than a pure growth formula.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $1,134.9M + $403.5M = $1,538.4M
    *   **Assumed Exit Multiple: 11.5x EV/EBITDA** - **(Correction)** Historically, SCI has traded in a 10-13x range. Using 11.5x, the midpoint of this range, provides a more realistic terminal value than the conservative implied multiple of 10.8x in the original analysis.
    *   **Terminal Value** = $1,538.4M \* 11.5 = **$17,692 million**
*   **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   A terminal value of $17,692M implies a perpetual growth rate of **2.89%** ($17,692M = ($785.6M\*(1+g))/(7.54%-g)). This is a reasonable long-term growth assumption, closely tracking inflation expectations and confirming that the 11.5x multiple is not overly aggressive.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Present Value of FCFF (Years 1-5):** $2,965 million (discounted at new WACC of 7.54%)
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $17,692M / (1 + 0.0754)^5 = **$12,285 million**
*   **Enterprise Value:** $2,965M + $12,285M = **$15,250 million**
*   **Less: Net Debt:** $4,782.6 million (Total Debt of $5,038.0M - Cash of $255.4M)
*   **Analyst's Equity Value:** $15,250M - $4,782.6M = **$10,467.4 million**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Year 5 Share Count:** 131.25 million (starting with 145.2M and reducing by 2.0% annually for 5 years)
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:** $10,467.4M / 131.25M shares = **$79.75**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $79.75** - As calculated above.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $66.00** - Assumes lower revenue growth (2.0% flat) and margin compression to 21.5%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $94.00** - Assumes slightly higher revenue growth (5.0% tapering to 4.0%) and modest margin expansion to 23.5%.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   MOS Price = $79.75 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$55.83**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** As a capital-intensive business with significant debt, SCI's profitability is sensitive to changes in interest rates, which could increase the cost of debt and WACC.
2.  **Cremation Trends:** The continued societal shift towards lower-cost cremation over traditional burials could pressure revenue growth and margins if the company cannot offset it with higher volume or pricing on other services.
3.  **Pre-need Sales Risk:** A significant portion of revenue is generated from pre-need contracts. Economic downturns or changes in consumer preferences could slow the growth of this backlog.
4.  **Acquisition Integration:** Future growth often depends on successfully acquiring and integrating smaller funeral homes and cemeteries. Failure to do so efficiently could lead to operational issues and goodwill impairment.

final answer is 79.75 $
