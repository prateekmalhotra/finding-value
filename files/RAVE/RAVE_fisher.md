Company: Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. (RAVE)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Rave Restaurant Group, Inc. Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 30, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rave Restaurant Group operates in the intensely competitive pizza segment. The company's growth plans for its primary brand, Pizza Inn, are described as modest increases in domestic and international units. The Pie Five brand is expected to see a modest decrease in units. Total domestic retail sales for Pizza Inn showed a slight increase of 0.3% for the nine months ended March 30, 2025, driven by a small increase in the number of buffet units and comparable store sales. However, Pie Five's domestic retail sales plummeted by 34.6% during the same period due to a significant decrease in store count and a drop in comparable sales. This mixed performance and the highly competitive nature of the restaurant industry suggest limited potential for a sizable increase in sales.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K filing mentions plans to expand the Pizza Inn system through new franchised restaurants and evaluating continued development in international markets. For Pie Five, the focus is on opportunistic franchise development with experienced operators. However, the overall tone suggests a cautious and limited approach to development rather than a strong determination for aggressive growth. The company also notes that it does not intend to open additional PIE Units in the foreseeable future, indicating a scaling back of at least one concept.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rave Restaurant Group's financial statements do not show any dedicated research and development expenses. While the company mentions the development of a "high-quality, pre-prepared crust" for its Express Units and a new prototype, the lack of reported R&D spending makes it impossible to assess the effectiveness of these efforts relative to the company's size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company supports franchisees with marketing and advertising programs funded by franchisee contributions. They provide materials for local store marketing, including support for new openings. However, the declining number of Pie Five units and the modest growth of Pizza Inn do not suggest an above-average sales organization. There is no specific disclosure of metrics like sales retention, win rates, or sales productivity that would indicate superior performance.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, Rave Restaurant Group reported income before taxes of $3.1 million on revenues of $12.2 million, resulting in a pre-tax profit margin of approximately 25.4%. For the nine months ended March 30, 2025, the company reported income before taxes of $2.4 million on revenues of $8.9 million, a pre-tax margin of about 26.9%. These are strong profit margins for a restaurant franchising company.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036125017905/ef20047581_10q.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036125017905/ef20047581_10q.htm) (May 8, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Total general and administrative expenses decreased by $0.2 million in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, driven by decreased salary and stock-based compensation expense. Franchise expenses also saw a decrease. The company's focus on a franchise-heavy model helps maintain high margins by keeping direct operating costs low.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2024, Rave Restaurant Group had only 21 full-time employees, none of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The small number of employees makes it difficult to assess labor relations in the way Fisher intended, which is more applicable to larger workforces. There is no significant information in the filings to suggest either outstanding or poor labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings list a stable management team and board of directors. There are no indications of significant turnover or disputes at the executive level. The CEO and CFO have been with the company for several years.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is a smaller reporting company with a lean management structure. While key executive roles are filled, the small size of the corporate team (21 employees) suggests limited management depth beyond the named executive officers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent registered public accounting firm, Whitley Penn LLP, provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. Management concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting were effective. There is no history of significant restatements or internal control issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The restaurant industry is intensely competitive. Rave's Pizza Inn brand has a long history, dating back to 1958, which could provide some brand recognition advantage in its core markets. The company's focus on franchising allows it to leverage the capital and local market knowledge of its franchisees. However, the struggles of the Pie Five brand and the overall modest growth trajectory do not indicate that Rave is outperforming its competition in a significant way.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's statements about modest future growth and its actions, such as discontinuing the PIE kiosk initiative, suggest a focus on maintaining current profitability rather than making significant investments for long-term growth. The repurchase of shares also indicates a focus on returning value to shareholders rather than reinvesting for substantial expansion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036125017905/ef20047581_10q.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036125017905/ef20047581_10q.htm) (May 8, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's balance sheet as of March 30, 2025, shows total shareholders' equity of $13.3 million. Cash provided by operating activities was $2.2 million for the nine months ended March 30, 2025. The company has no significant debt. This financial position, combined with modest growth plans, makes it highly unlikely that the company would need to resort to dilutive equity financing. In fact, the company has been repurchasing its own stock.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036125017905/ef20047581_10q.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036125017905/ef20047581_10q.htm) (May 8, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's SEC filings provide a straightforward discussion of its business and financial results, including the challenges faced by the Pie Five brand and the closures of international Pizza Inn units. The available transcripts of earnings calls from previous years, though not recent, suggest a willingness to engage with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024), ["https://discountingcashflows.com/company/RAVE/transcripts/"](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/RAVE/transcripts/) (Accessed August 21, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no indications of any material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance red flags in the reviewed SEC filings. The company states that any pending claims and actions are either covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/718332/000114036124041977/ef20030084_10k.htm) (September 26, 2024)

---
**Synthesis:**
Rave Restaurant Group presents a mixed picture. Its strengths lie in its profitable franchising model, which generates healthy margins, and a solid financial position with no debt and a share buyback program in place. The company also appears to have stable and transparent management with sound accounting controls. However, the company's growth prospects are a major concern. The flagship Pizza Inn brand is seeing only modest growth, while the Pie Five brand is in a state of decline. The lack of significant investment in development and a cautious outlook suggest a company focused on maintaining the status quo rather than pursuing substantial expansion. To improve its score, RAVE would need to demonstrate a clear and effective strategy for reigniting growth, particularly in the struggling Pie Five segment, and show a greater commitment to innovation and development. A significant increase in new unit openings and a reversal of the negative comparable sales trend at Pie Five would be key evidence of a positive shift.
