### 1) Network Effects (weight 18%)
**Reasoning:** The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program and Mobile Order & Pay system create a modest network effect. As more customers use the platform, it becomes more valuable through personalization and convenience, but the marginal utility for each new user does not increase dramatically. The primary network is single-sided, benefiting the user through accumulated rewards ("Stars") and easier ordering, rather than creating direct user-to-user interactions.
**Evidence:**
*   The Starbucks Card program, which is linked to the Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, is designed to increase the frequency of store visits. Registered members can earn "Stars" by paying with various methods, not just the card, at nearly all company-operated and licensed stores in North America. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   The Mobile Order and Pay functionality allows customers to place orders in advance, demonstrating a convenience-based lock-in that strengthens the user network. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** Switching costs are primarily behavioral and loyalty-based rather than contractual. Customers invested in the Starbucks Rewards ecosystem risk losing accumulated Stars and the convenience of a familiar mobile ordering system. While the financial cost to switch to a competitor is zero, the psychological friction of abandoning earned rewards and adapting to a new system creates a notable, albeit not insurmountable, barrier.
**Evidence:**
*   Customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, where they can accumulate "Stars" that can be redeemed for free products. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   The stored value card liability, representing funds loaded by customers, was USD 1,781.2 million as of March 30, 2025, indicating a significant pool of customers financially tied to the ecosystem. (Form 10-Q, March 30, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** Starbucks leverages its massive scale to achieve cost advantages in green coffee procurement, supply chain logistics, and marketing. By purchasing coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed commitments, it can mitigate some price volatility. This scale allows for favorable terms with suppliers for dairy and other inputs, though the company remains exposed to commodity price fluctuations which can impact margins.
**Evidence:**
*   Starbucks generally controls coffee purchasing, roasting, and packaging to ensure standards, leveraging its scale to secure adequate supply through fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   The company operates ten farmer support centers globally to help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and promote best practices, an investment smaller competitors cannot easily replicate. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   Consolidated operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 15.0%, demonstrating profitability despite inflationary pressures and strategic investments. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP (weight 12%)
**Reasoning:** Starbucks possesses one of the most valuable and recognized brands in the world, which allows it to command a price premium over competitors and foster strong customer loyalty. This brand is supported by key trademarks of material importance. The consistent "Starbucks Experience" is a core intangible asset that drives repeat business globally.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's primary objective is "to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world." (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   Starbucks owns numerous material trademarks, including "Starbucks," the Starbucks logo, "Starbucks Reserve," and "Frappuccino," which are protected in the U.S. and other countries and are generally renewable indefinitely. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 5 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** Starbucks' global network of over 40,000 stores creates a formidable distribution footprint that is difficult and capital-intensive to replicate. This density provides significant convenience for customers and creates barriers to entry for smaller players competing for prime retail locations. The mix of company-operated and licensed stores allows for disciplined, capital-efficient expansion.
**Evidence:**
*   As of September 29, 2024, Starbucks had 40,199 stores worldwide, with 21,018 being company-operated and 19,181 licensed. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   The North America segment alone had 18,424 stores, demonstrating significant market penetration in its most mature market. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   The Channel Development segment leverages a Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé to distribute products in grocery and foodservice channels, extending its reach beyond its retail stores. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** The Starbucks Rewards program and mobile app provide a rich source of customer data on purchasing habits, location, and preferences. This data allows for personalized marketing, optimized menu offerings, and improved customer experiences. While a significant asset, the direct evidence of this data creating a feedback loop that materially improves product and retention over competitors is not explicitly detailed in filings.
**Evidence:**
*   The Starbucks Rewards program and mobile app are central to the company's digital strategy, enabling direct customer engagement and data collection. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   The company notes its strategy includes "driving convenience, brand engagement, and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery, and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally." (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects (weight 8%)
**Reasoning:** Starbucks has built a strong ecosystem around its retail and consumer-packaged goods businesses. The Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé is a prime example, creating a platform for widespread distribution of its products. Partnerships with delivery services like Uber Eats and DoorDash further extend its ecosystem, though these are not exclusive and thus provide a lesser moat.
**Evidence:**
*   The Channel Development segment operates largely under the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, selling a variety of products worldwide outside of its retail stores. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   The ready-to-drink business operates under collaborative relationships with partners like PepsiCo, extending the brand's reach and creating a multi-channel ecosystem. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers (weight 6%)
**Reasoning:** The specialty coffee retail market has minimal regulatory barriers to entry. While Starbucks must comply with food safety, labor, and public health regulations in 87 markets, these rules apply to all competitors and do not confer a unique advantage. The company does not hold any material, exclusive licenses or patents that prevent competition.
**Evidence:**
*   The company is subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions, which may differ, but these are general business regulations not specific barriers to entry. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   Competition is described as "intensely competitive," with rivals including specialty coffee shops, quick-service restaurants, and CPG companies, indicating low barriers to entry. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity (weight 4%)
**Reasoning:** The business is moderately capital intensive, requiring significant investment in store build-outs, remodels, and technology. These assets, particularly leasehold improvements, have a degree of specificity but can be repurposed. The high capital required to build a global network of tens of thousands of stores serves as a deterrent to new entrants seeking to compete at scale.
**Evidence:**
*   Capital expenditures were USD 2.8 billion in fiscal 2024, a significant investment driven by new and existing stores. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
*   As of September 29, 2024, the company had net property, plant, and equipment valued at USD 8.7 billion. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility (weight 2%)
**Reasoning:** While Starbucks does not have long-term customer contracts, the stored value card program provides a degree of revenue visibility. The liability on these cards represents future sales that are highly likely to be realized. This creates a predictable, recurring revenue stream from a loyal customer base.
**Evidence:**
*   The stored value card liability was USD 1,781.2 million as of March 30, 2025, representing cash received from customers for future purchases. (Form 10-Q, March 30, 2025).
*   Revenue from stored value cards is recognized upon redemption, and the company recognizes "breakage" income for the portion of cards not expected to be redeemed, indicating a high probability of conversion to revenue. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(3 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (5 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 0.54 + 0.45 + 0.45 + 0.60 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.16 + 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.06 = 3.1
This corresponds to a score of 31.0 out of 100.
**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 31.0 / 100

### Mapping
**Final Moat Rating:**
A weighted score of 31.0 falls within the 30-50 range, which maps to a moat rating of 2.
*   Weighted ≥ 85 → 5
*   70 ≤ Weighted < 85 → 4
*   50 ≤ Weighted < 70 → 3
*   **30 ≤ Weighted < 50 → 2**
*   10 ≤ Weighted < 30 → 1
*   Weighted < 10 → 0

### Moat Duration Justification
The moat's durability is estimated at approximately 10-12 years. The primary sources of the moat—brand strength and distribution scale—are highly durable but not impervious to erosion from shifting consumer preferences and intense competition. Key patents are not a factor, and trademarks like "Starbucks" can be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use, providing a long-term protective layer. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Brand Degradation:** A failure to manage social issues, labor relations (including unionization efforts), or a major food safety incident could significantly tarnish the brand, eroding its pricing power and customer loyalty. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
2.  **Shifting Consumer Habits:** A permanent shift in consumer preferences towards at-home coffee consumption, lower-priced competitors, or healthier alternatives could reduce traffic and weaken the value of Starbucks' vast physical store network. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).
3.  **Failure of Digital Strategy:** If the Starbucks Rewards program and mobile app fail to keep pace with innovation or become less compelling, the switching costs and data advantage would diminish, making it easier for customers to choose rivals. (Form 10-K, September 29, 2024).

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Comparable Store Sales Growth:** A sustained decline would indicate weakening brand relevance and pricing power.
*   **Operating Margin:** Compression suggests an erosion of cost advantages or pricing power.
*   **Starbucks Rewards Membership Growth & Engagement:** Stagnation or decline in active members signals a weakening of the loyalty-based switching costs.
*   **Customer Traffic/Transactions:** A key indicator of brand health and competitive pressure.
*   **Licensed Store Revenue Growth:** Indicates the health of the brand and its ability to expand in a capital-efficient manner.
*   **Channel Development Revenue:** Monitors the success of the Nestlé alliance and brand extension.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** High levels without corresponding revenue growth could indicate inefficient use of capital.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Starbucks' moat is primarily built on its globally recognized brand and its vast, efficient distribution network. These intangible assets and scale advantages allow it to generate significant economic profits. However, the moat is narrower than it might appear due to low customer switching costs in the absence of its loyalty program and intense competition in the beverage and restaurant industries. The final rating of 2/5 reflects the strength of these core advantages while conservatively acknowledging their vulnerability to shifts in consumer behavior and competitive pressure over a long-term horizon. A sustained increase in comparable store sales and operating margins, particularly in its mature North American market, would be the primary evidence that could lead to a higher rating.

moat rating is 2 / 5
