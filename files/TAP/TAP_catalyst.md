### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On September 29, 2023, the Board approved a share repurchase program to repurchase up to an aggregate of $2.0 billion of the Company's Class B common stock, with an expected program term of five years. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $1.21 billion remained available for repurchase under the program. (Form 10-K, Feb 18, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price, assuming the company's valuation multiple remains constant. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with repurchases expected to continue over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company repurchases $300 million of stock at an average price of $60/share, retiring 5 million shares.
    *   **Base Case:** The company repurchases $500 million of stock at an average price of $60/share, retiring 8.33 million shares.
    *   **High Case:** The company repurchases $750 million of stock at an average price of $60/share, retiring 12.5 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). The repurchase program is already known, but consistent execution can provide support for the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, as evidenced by the $789.1 million repurchased as of December 31, 2024.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's ability to generate sufficient cash flow and management's discretion to continue the program.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchases in the company's 10-Q and 10-K filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in the business could lead to the suspension of the program to conserve cash.

**2. Catalyst Title: Dividend Increase**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a history of paying dividends, with a quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share declared and paid throughout 2024. (Form 10-K, Feb 18, 2025) A potential increase in the dividend could be a positive catalyst.
*   **Mechanism:** A dividend increase signals a strong financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, which can attract income-focused investors and increase demand for the stock.
*   **Timing:** Within the next 12 months, likely to be announced in conjunction with a quarterly earnings release.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Dividend increases by 5% to $0.462 per quarter.
    *   **Base Case:** Dividend increases by 10% to $0.484 per quarter.
    *   **High Case:** Dividend increases by 15% to $0.506 per quarter.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (1-3%).
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has a track record of consistent dividend payments and a solid financial position.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a positive outlook for the business.

**3. Catalyst Title: ZOA Energy and Fever-Tree Partnerships**
*   **Type:** Partnership
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Molson Coors increased its stake in ZOA Energy to 51% in October 2024 and entered into a partnership with Fever-Tree in February 2025 to produce, market, and sell Fever-Tree products in the U.S. These moves are part of the company's strategy to expand beyond the beer aisle. (Form 10-K, Feb 18, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** Successful execution of these partnerships could lead to incremental revenue and profit growth, diversifying the company's revenue streams and increasing its exposure to higher-growth beverage categories.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with the financial impact expected to become more apparent over the next 12-24 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The partnerships contribute an additional $100 million in revenue in the first year.
    *   **Base Case:** The partnerships contribute an additional $250 million in revenue in the first year.
    *   **High Case:** The partnerships contribute an additional $500 million in revenue in the first year.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small-Medium (5-15%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful integration of the new brands, effective marketing and distribution, and consumer acceptance of the products.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Company reports on the performance of its "beyond beer" portfolio, market share data for ZOA Energy and Fever-Tree products in the U.S.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** The new products may not resonate with consumers, or the company may face stiff competition from established players in the energy drink and premium mixer categories.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The "beyond beer" strategy is a key part of the company's growth story.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Successful Execution of the "Acceleration Plan"**
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In October 2023, the company announced its "Acceleration Plan," which focuses on growing its core power brands, aggressively premiumizing its portfolio, expanding beyond beer, and investing in its capabilities. The plan aims to have one-third of its global brand portfolio in the above-premium category in the medium term. (Form 10-K, Feb 18, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** Successful execution of the plan would lead to higher revenue growth, improved margins, and a more diversified and resilient business model. This would likely result in a higher valuation multiple for the stock.
*   **Timing:** 12-60 months
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company achieves low single-digit revenue growth and a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin.
    *   **Base Case:** The company achieves mid-single-digit revenue growth and a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
    *   **High Case:** The company achieves high single-digit revenue growth and a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium-Large (15-40%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a solid track record of executing on its strategic plans, but there are risks associated with shifting consumer preferences and a competitive market.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's ability to innovate, market its products effectively, and adapt to changing consumer trends.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Revenue growth, operating margin, market share data for core and premium brands, and the performance of the "beyond beer" portfolio.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** The company may not be able to achieve its growth and margin targets due to competition, changing consumer preferences, or a downturn in the economy.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The "Acceleration Plan" is the cornerstone of the company's long-term value creation story.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program:**
*   **Formula:** (Net Income / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) \* P/E Multiple
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Net Income: $1,122.4 million (FY 2024) (Form 10-K, Feb 18, 2025)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 209.9 million (diluted, FY 2024) (Form 10-K, Feb 18, 2025)
    *   Shares Repurchased: 8.33 million (Base Case)
    *   P/E Multiple: 12x (conservative estimate)
*   **Calculation:** ($1,122.4 million / (209.9 million - 8.33 million)) \* 12 = $67.00 per share
*   **Current Price (for comparison):** $56.29 (May 21, 2025) (OpenInsider)
*   **Implied Upside:** 19%

**2. Successful Execution of the "Acceleration Plan":**
*   **Formula:** (Revenue \* (Operating Margin + Margin Improvement)) \* (1 - Tax Rate) / Shares Outstanding \* P/E Multiple
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Revenue: $11,627.0 million (FY 2024) (Form 10-K, Feb 18, 2025)

*   **Calculation:** ($11,627.0 million \* (15.1% + 1.0%)) \* (1 - 23%) / 209.9 million \* 15 = $102.50 per share
*   **Implied Upside:** 82%
