Company: Nathan's Famous, Inc. (NATH)
Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Press Releases for Fiscal Year 2025 and First Quarter 2026, 2023 10-K filing.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous is seeing growth across its key segments. In fiscal 2025, revenues grew to $148.2 million from $138.6 million in the prior year. This growth was driven by a significant increase in license royalties, which rose from $33.6 million to $37.4 million, and growth in the Branded Product Program (sales to foodservice industry), which increased from $86.5 million to $91.8 million. The company's continued expansion into grocery stores and foodservice indicates a long runway for growth beyond its restaurant footprint.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While specific R&D spending is not detailed in the available press releases, the company's expansion of its licensing and Branded Product Program suggests a focus on developing new avenues for its existing products. The core product, hot dogs, is mature, but Nathan's is finding new markets and channels for it. Without access to the full 10-K and management's detailed plans, it is difficult to assess their commitment to developing entirely new products.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous is not a company driven by traditional R&D. Information on R&D spending is not available in the press releases. The company's innovation is more focused on marketing, brand licensing, and distribution than on creating new products. Therefore, it's not possible to assess the effectiveness of R&D efforts.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The strong growth in the Branded Product Program and license royalties suggests an effective sales and business development team. For fiscal year 2025, sales to the foodservice industry increased by $5.3 million, and license royalties grew by over $3.8 million. This demonstrates success in expanding the brand's presence in various sales channels.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal year 2025, Nathan's Famous reported income from operations of $36.5 million on revenues of $148.2 million, for an operating margin of approximately 24.6%. Net income was $24 million, resulting in a net profit margin of about 16.2%. These are strong margins for a company in the food industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the available documents do not detail specific margin improvement programs, the company's focus on high-margin licensing and franchising businesses is a key driver of profitability. The growth in these areas, as opposed to lower-margin company-owned restaurants, naturally improves the overall margin profile. However, in the first quarter of fiscal 2026, income from operations decreased despite higher revenues, suggesting some margin pressure.
**Answer:** No

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the reviewed press releases regarding labor and personnel relations. Without access to the full 10-K filing, which would include details on employees and any labor disputes, it is impossible to assess this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information regarding executive relations, such as board stability and succession planning, is not available in the press releases. This requires a review of the company's proxy statement, which was not accessible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The press releases do not provide information on the company's management team beyond the top executives. An assessment of management depth would require reviewing the executive biographies in the 10-K or proxy statement, which were not available.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides segment revenues in its press releases, which offers some insight into its business. However, without the full financial statements and auditor's report from the 10-K, it is not possible to fully assess the quality of the company's cost analysis and accounting controls. The regular and timely filing of financial results is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous's primary competitive advantage is its iconic brand, built over more than a century and reinforced by the annual Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest. This brand recognition allows the company to pursue a highly profitable, capital-light licensing and franchising model, which is a significant differentiator in the restaurant and food products industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent payment of a quarterly dividend suggests a focus on returning capital to shareholders, which can sometimes be at odds with a long-term, high-growth investment strategy. While the company is growing its licensing and foodservice businesses, there is no explicit evidence in the available documents of a willingness to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term growth.
**Answer:** No

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generates strong cash flow and has a healthy balance sheet. The fact that Nathan's is paying a regular quarterly dividend is a strong indicator that it is not in need of cash for operations or expansion. There is no indication that the company will need to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous issues regular press releases for its quarterly and annual results. However, the company does not appear to host earnings calls, as no transcripts are available. This limits the opportunity for investors to ask questions and hear management's unscripted views on the business, making it difficult to assess their candor.
**Answer:** No

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2023 10-K mentions a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is available on the company's website. A search of publicly available information does not reveal any recent legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of the management team. However, without access to the latest proxy statement for a review of related-party transactions, a definitive "Yes" is not possible.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**
Nathan's Famous scores positively on several of Fisher's points, primarily due to its strong brand, profitable business model, and solid financial position. The company's growth in licensing and foodservice demonstrates a clear path for future expansion, and its high profit margins are a significant strength. However, the analysis is severely hampered by the lack of detailed information from recent full SEC filings and the absence of earnings call transcripts. This leads to "No" answers on many of the qualitative points regarding management, as there is insufficient evidence to make a judgment. The score could be most impacted in the next 12-24 months by a slowdown in the growth of the licensing and Branded Product programs, or by increased margin pressure. A positive change in the score would require more transparency from the company, including hosting earnings calls and providing more detailed disclosures in their SEC filings.

fisher score is 5 / 15
