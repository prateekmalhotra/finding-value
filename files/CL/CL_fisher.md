### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate's business strategy is explicitly focused on science-led core and premium innovation and pursuing higher-growth adjacent categories. Management's discussion highlights building and scaling capabilities in innovation, digital, data, and analytics. The company's commitment is also demonstrated by its 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which concluded on December 31, 2024, and was designed to reallocate resources towards strategic priorities and faster-growth businesses. In February 2025, the company announced the acquisition of the Prime100 pet food brand, indicating a focus on expanding its pet nutrition segment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate's R&D expenses are included in Corporate overhead costs and are not explicitly broken out in the segment reporting, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the company emphasizes its focus on "science-led" products and innovation as a core part of its strategy. The company maintains primary research centers for its main product categories in New Jersey, Mexico, and Kansas. The continuous rollout of new products and the growth in oral care market share suggest R&D is effective in maintaining its leadership position.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates in over 200 countries and territories with a global sales force and distribution network. Sales to Walmart represented approximately 11% of net sales in 2024, indicating a strong relationship with a key retailer. The company has demonstrated consistent organic sales growth, which increased by 7.4% in 2024, driven by volume growth and pricing. This performance across diverse global markets suggests a highly effective sales and distribution organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Colgate-Palmolive reported a Gross Profit Margin of 60.5% and an Operating Profit Margin of 21.2%. The non-GAAP gross profit margin for 2024 was 60.6%. These margins demonstrate strong profitability, especially for a company in the competitive consumer staples sector. For the first quarter of 2025, the gross profit margin increased to 60.8%.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000020/cl-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000020/cl-20250331.htm) (April 25, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company employs "funding-the-growth" initiatives focused on cost reduction in direct materials, indirect expenses, distribution, and logistics. In 2024, these initiatives, along with higher pricing, contributed to a 240 basis point increase in non-GAAP gross profit margin. The company also engages in revenue growth management and has implemented pricing actions to offset rising material costs. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative, which concluded in 2024, was another effort to streamline the supply chain and reduce structural costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Colgate-Palmolive had approximately 34,000 employees. The company emphasizes its values of "We are Caring, We are Inclusive and We are Courageous" and is committed to fostering a supportive and inclusive workplace. There are no mentions of significant labor disputes in the recent SEC filings. Certain employees are represented by unions or works councils, which is normal for a company of this scale. Without more specific data on employee turnover or engagement scores, this assessment relies on the company's stated policies and lack of negative disclosures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, as listed in the 2024 10-K, shows stability and long tenure for most members, with many having served in various capacities within the company for over five years. The Chief Financial Officer is the most recent senior addition, having joined in 2020. The Board of Directors oversees a rigorous succession planning process, with a special focus on CEO succession, which indicates a structured approach to executive development and transition. This stability suggests a cohesive and effective executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate's 2024 10-K lists seven executive officers, including the CEO, CFO, Chief Legal Officer, and Group Presidents, indicating a clear leadership structure with defined roles. The company's global operations are managed by geographic leadership teams, suggesting a deep bench of management talent beyond the executive officers. The company's formal succession planning process for key positions further supports the existence of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's report also concluded that internal controls were effective. The detailed segment reporting and consistent financial disclosures in the 10-K and 10-Q demonstrate robust accounting practices. There is no indication of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate's global leadership in toothpaste (41.4% market share in 2024) and manual toothbrushes (32.2% market share) is a significant competitive advantage in the consumer products industry. This brand dominance, built over decades, creates a powerful barrier to entry. The company's deep relationships with dental professionals for its Oral Care business and with veterinarians for its Hill's Pet Nutrition business are key industry-specific strengths that are difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's extensive global distribution network is another critical asset.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's stated strategy is to deliver "consistent compounded earnings per share growth to help drive superior total shareholder return" and to "deliver sustainable, profitable long-term growth." The company's "funding-the-growth" initiatives are designed to generate savings that can be reinvested in the business to support long-term growth. The consistent investment in advertising, which increased by 14.7% in 2024 to $2,720 million, demonstrates a focus on long-term brand building rather than short-term profit maximization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate-Palmolive has a strong history of generating cash from operations, which was $4,107 million in 2024. The company has a consistent share repurchase program, buying back $1,739 million worth of shares in 2024, which is anti-dilutive. As of December 31, 2024, the company had access to $3,725 million in unused credit lines. Given its strong cash flow and access to debt markets, the need for dilutive equity financing appears very low.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K and 10-Q reports provide a detailed and transparent overview of its performance, including challenges. The "Outlook" section of the MD&A openly discusses headwinds like macroeconomic conditions, inflation, foreign currency volatility, and heightened competitive activity. The company provides detailed segment performance, including areas of weakness. For instance, the Q1 2025 report notes organic sales declines in North America and Asia Pacific and explains the drivers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000020/cl-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000020/cl-20250331.htm) (April 25, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a publicly available Code of Conduct that applies to all employees and directors, and it maintains a policy of not granting waivers. The 2024 10-K discloses ongoing legal proceedings, including talcum powder litigation and a Brazilian tax matter, which are not uncommon for a company of its size and are being vigorously contested. The auditor's report on internal controls is clean, and there are no disclosed material governance red flags, related-party transactions, or code-of-conduct breaches by senior management. The one blemish is a litigation loss related to an ERISA matter concerning the calculation of pension benefits, for which the company has taken charges. While this is a negative event, it does not suggest a systemic lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000020/cl-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000020/cl-20250331.htm) (April 25, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Colgate-Palmolive scores perfectly on this Fisher analysis, reflecting its status as a high-quality, stable, and well-managed consumer staples leader. The company's strongest positives are its dominant brands in large, steadily growing global markets, its consistent and worthwhile profit margins, and its strong financial health, which eliminates the risk of shareholder dilution. The management team appears stable, deep, and shareholder-focused, with a clear strategy for long-term growth funded by robust internal efficiency programs.

The score is unlikely to change significantly in the next 12-24 months. However, the key variables to watch would be the organic sales volume trends, particularly in developed markets like North America where recent performance has been weaker. Sustained volume declines could challenge the "Long Runway" thesis. Additionally, a significant adverse outcome in the ongoing talcum powder litigation, while seemingly unlikely to have a material financial impact based on current disclosures, could create reputational damage and call into question the "Unquestionable Integrity" point if new, negative information were to emerge. Finally, continued success in innovating and growing the higher-margin Pet Nutrition segment will be crucial for maintaining the positive long-term outlook.

fisher score is 15 / 15
