**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sprouts' smaller store format (21,000-25,000 square feet for new stores) allows for flexibility in site selection and lower operating costs compared to larger supermarkets.

The company's strong operating cash flow of $645.2 million in fiscal 2024 is sufficient to fund its capital expenditures, which are expected to be between $230-$250 million in 2025.

The company's investor relations website provides a wealth of information, including financial results, SEC filings, and presentations.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings, including the 2024 10-K, reveals no material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of the management team.

Synthesis:
Sprouts Farmers Market scores highly on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its growth strategy, product innovation, and financial health. The company's focus on the growing natural and organic food market, coupled with its disciplined expansion plan and investment in its private label brand, provides a long runway for growth. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the new store openings in achieving projected returns, the ability to maintain momentum in a competitive grocery landscape, and the continued execution of its supply chain optimization strategy. A significant slowdown in comparable store sales growth or a failure to effectively manage the costs associated with expansion would be the most likely factors to turn a "Yes" to a "No".

fisher score is 15 / 15
