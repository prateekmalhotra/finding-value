### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Acquisition of Dana Off-Highway Business:**
   - **Formula:** (ALSN Market Cap + Dana Off-Highway Enterprise Value - Synergies) / (ALSN EBITDA + Dana Off-Highway EBITDA)
   - **Inputs:**
     - ALSN Market Cap: ~$7.5B
     - Dana Off-Highway Enterprise Value: $2.7B
     - Synergies: $120M
     - ALSN EBITDA (2024): $1.165B
     - Dana Off-Highway EBITDA (2024): $400M
   - **Calculation:** ($7.5B + $2.7B - $0.12B) / ($1.165B + $0.4B) = 6.4x EV/EBITDA

**2. Defense Segment Growth:**
   - **Formula:** (Incremental Revenue * EBITDA Margin) / (Shares Outstanding) = Incremental EPS
   - **Inputs:**
     - Incremental Revenue: $100M
     - EBITDA Margin: 36.1%
     - Shares Outstanding: ~86M
   - **Calculation:** ($100M * 0.361) / 86M = $0.42 Incremental EPS

### **Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Allison Transmission are predominantly positive, with the transformative acquisition of Dana's Off-Highway business poised to be a major value driver. This, combined with strong growth in the high-margin defense sector and continued share repurchases, creates a favorable outlook. However, softness in the North American On-Highway market presents a headwind that could temper short-term performance.

### **Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failure to successfully integrate the Dana Off-Highway acquisition:** This could lead to a failure to realize synergies and a negative impact on earnings.
2.  **A significant downturn in the global economy:** This would negatively impact demand for commercial vehicles across all of Allison's end markets.
3.  **A major technological disruption in the commercial vehicle market:** This could render Allison's current product portfolio obsolete.

### **Final Recommendation Paragraph**

The acquisition of Dana's Off-Highway business is a transformative catalyst for Allison Transmission that has the potential to drive significant long-term value. While near-term headwinds in the North American On-Highway market exist, the company's strong position in the defense sector and its commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks provide a solid foundation. We recommend a "Buy" rating with a potential upside of over 30%, and the single most important indicator to monitor is the successful integration of the Dana acquisition and the realization of expected synergies.
