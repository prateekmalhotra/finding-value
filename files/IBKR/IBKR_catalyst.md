### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (Short)**

**1. Increased Quarterly Dividend:**
Assuming a constant P/E ratio, a 10% increase in the dividend could lead to a proportional increase in the stock price as the dividend yield becomes more attractive. For example, if the dividend increases from $1.00 to $1.10 annually, and the required yield for investors is 2%, the implied stock price would be $55 ($1.10 / 0.02), compared to $50 ($1.00 / 0.02) previously.

**2. Sustained Growth in Customer Accounts and Equity:**
If customer equity grows by 20% over the next year, and the company maintains its current revenue and profit margins on that equity, earnings could also increase by a similar amount. Assuming a constant P/E ratio, this could lead to a 20% increase in the stock price.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for IBKR appears positive. The recent dividend increase, coupled with strong growth in customer accounts and trading volumes, provides a solid foundation for potential share price appreciation in the next 0–12 months. While a market downturn remains a risk, the company's strong financial position and growing customer base suggest a positive short-term market signal.

2.  **A major cybersecurity breach:** A significant security incident could damage the company's reputation and lead to a loss of customer trust and assets.
3.  **Increased regulatory scrutiny:** New regulations or fines could increase compliance costs and limit business activities, impacting profitability.
