### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | **6.5%** (Midpoint of management's 6-7% guidance) | Q1 2025 Transcript |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)** | Declining from **6.0% to 4.5%**. Assumes gradual deceleration as the company matures and the market remains competitive. | Analyst Estimate |
| **Operating Margin** | Starts at **1.28%** and expands by 25 bps annually to **2.28%** in Year 5. Assumes modest operating leverage from scale and growth in higher-margin segments like sponsored ads. | Analyst Estimate |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **21.0%** (Midpoint of management's 20-22% guidance) | Q1 2025 Transcript |
| **D&A (% of Revenue)** | **0.64%** (Held constant from the TTM average) | Baseline Financials |
| **SBC (% of Revenue)** | **2.6%** (Held constant from the TTM average) | Baseline Financials |
| **Capex (% of Revenue)** | **1.75%** (Midpoint of management's 1.5-2.0% guidance) | Q4 2024 Transcript |
| **Change in NWC** | **$0**. For simplicity, assuming efficient working capital management neutralizes cash impact. | Baseline Financials |

---

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure changes.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD, millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $12,887 | $13,660 | $14,411 | $15,059 | $15,737 |
| EBIT | $165 | $210 | $261 | $318 | $359 |
| NOPAT (EBIT\*(1-T))| $130 | $166 | $206 | $251 | $283 |
| \+ D&A | $83 | $87 | $92 | $96 | $101 |
| \- Stock-Based Comp | $335 | $355 | $375 | $392 | $409 |
| \- Capex | $226 | $239 | $252 | $264 | $275 |
| \- Change in NWC | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **FCFF** | **($348)** | **($341)** | **($329)** | **($309)** | **($300)** |

*(Note: The negative FCFF is driven by the high level of stock-based compensation, which is treated as a real cash cost in this analysis.)*

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value / Calculation | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)**| **12.66%** | `Ke = Rf + Beta * ERP` |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.31% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield) | Market Data (August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP)| 5.00% (Standard assumption for U.S. market) | Analyst Estimate |
| Levered Beta (Î²) | 1.67 (5-Year Monthly Beta) | Yahoo Finance |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **1.03%** | `Interest Expense / Total Debt` ($5.5M / $535.3M) |
| After-Tax Kd | 0.81% | `Kd * (1 - Tax Rate)` |
| **WACC** | **12.35%** | `(E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-T)` |
| Equity Value (E) | $16,905 M (Market Capitalization) | Yahoo Finance |
| Debt Value (D) | $535.3 M (Total Debt) | Baseline Financials |
| Weight of Equity (E/V) | 96.9% | Calculated |
| Weight of Debt (D/V) | 3.1% | Calculated |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Inputs & Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth** | `TV = FCFF_Y5 * (1+g) / (WACC - g)`<br> `g = 2.5%` (Long-run inflation expectation)<br>TV = (-$300 \* 1.025) / (0.1235 - 0.025) | **($3,101 M)** |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| (Not applicable due to negative projected cash flows) | N/A |

*Due to the negative free cash flow forecast driven by high stock-based compensation, the terminal value is also negative. This indicates that under the current cost structure, the company is not projected to generate positive cash flow for its providers of capital, even in perpetuity.*

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Explicit FCFF** | Sum of discounted FCFF from Y1-Y5 | **($1,208 M)** |
| **PV of Terminal Value**| `TV / (1 + WACC)^5` | **($1,732 M)** |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)**| PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value | **($2,940 M)** |
| **Less: Net Debt** | Total Debt - Cash ($535.3M - $616.4M) | **($81.1 M)** |
| **Equity Value** | `EV - Net Debt` | **($2,859 M)** |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

The valuation results in a negative equity value, which suggests the company's projected cash flows do not support its current capital structure and cost basis, particularly when treating stock-based compensation as a cash expense.

*   **Base Case Fair Value:** **Negative** (Not meaningful)
*   **Low/Bear Case:** The base case already reflects a bear case scenario due to the treatment of SBC. More pessimistic inputs would result in a more negative value.
*   **High/Bull Case:** A bull case would require a significant, unguided acceleration in margin expansion and revenue growth to offset the large SBC expense and turn FCFF positive.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% discount):** **Not applicable** due to negative base value.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **High Stock-Based Compensation:** SBC represents a significant economic cost (~2.6% of revenue) that heavily outweighs operating profit, leading to negative free cash flow. The valuation is extremely sensitive to this assumption.
2.  **Competitive Intensity:** The online pet supply market is highly competitive, with pressure from large players like Amazon and other specialized retailers, which could limit margin expansion potential.
3.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** A significant portion of Chewy's sales are tied to discretionary items. In an economic downturn, a reduction in pet-related spending could negatively impact revenue growth.
4.  **Customer Acquisition Costs:** The ability to grow the active customer base without a significant increase in marketing spend is crucial for future profitability and remains a key risk.

Due to the negative free cash flow projection when treating stock-based compensation as an economic cost, this DCF model yields a negative intrinsic value. This suggests that for the valuation to be positive, one must either forecast a dramatic and rapid improvement in operating margins far beyond historical norms or choose not to deduct SBC from cash flows, which would not be a conservative approach.
