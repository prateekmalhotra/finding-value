*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** A multi-faceted plan to recenter the company on its core mission, including enhancing the customer experience, improving employee engagement and retention, and driving operational efficiencies. The strategy includes a focus on authentic coffeehouse experiences and efficient workflows.
*   **Mechanism:** Successful execution of this strategy could lead to increased customer traffic, higher transaction values, and improved operating margins, thereby increasing earnings and justifying a higher stock valuation. The focus on customer experience and partner engagement is expected to rebuild brand loyalty and drive repeat business.

*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low:** 1% increase in comparable store sales, 50 bps margin improvement.

    *   **High:** 4-5% increase in comparable store sales, 150 bps margin improvement.
