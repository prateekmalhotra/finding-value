**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions priced into the stock, we can set up a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model that solves for the growth rate required to justify the current market price.

*   **Current Enterprise Value:** (24,734M shares * $174.98/share) - ($53,691M Cash - $10,285M Debt) = **$4,284,510M**
*   **WACC (preliminary):** Assuming a WACC of 11.5% (detailed in Part 2) and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%.
*   **FCFF Baseline (TTM):** $86,182M EBIT * (1 - 13.4% tax) + $2,065M D&A - $5,200M SBC - $4,094M Capex - ($1,563M) Change in WC = **$70,223M**

Holding the TTM operating margin of 58.0% constant, a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 35.5%** is required to justify the current enterprise value of ~$4.28 trillion.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the stock price of $174.98, one must believe NVIDIA can grow its revenues at a CAGR of over 35% for the next five years while maintaining its extraordinarily high current operating margin of 58%. This represents a monumental expectation of sustained, high-profitability growth.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The market-implied growth rate of 35.5% is extremely high for a company of NVIDIA's scale, implying a belief that its current hyper-growth phase will continue unabated. My base case will assume a more conservative, tapering growth trajectory.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1â€“5:** The market's implied 35.5% CAGR is aggressive. While recent growth has been explosive, the law of large numbers and increasing competition make this unsustainable. I will model a tapering growth rate starting at 30% in Year 1 and declining to 8% by Year 5, for a 5-year CAGR of approximately 18.9%. This is still robust but acknowledges maturation.

8.  **Margin Path:** Management has not provided explicit long-term margin guidance. The TTM operating margin is 58.0%. I will assume a slight moderation due to competitive pressures and product mix changes, holding the operating margin stable at a still-excellent **55.0%** through the forecast period.

9.  **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is 13.4%. I will use a conservative, normalized effective tax rate of **15.0%** going forward.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Historically, Capex has been a small percentage of revenue. I'll model Capex at **3.0% of revenue**, slightly above the TTM average to account for continued R&D and infrastructure investment.
    *   **Working Capital:** I'll model the change in working capital as **5.0% of the change in revenue**, which is in line with historical patterns of efficient working capital management.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Stock-Based Compensation is a real cost and will be subtracted from FCFF. I'll model it as **3.5% of revenue**, consistent with TTM levels.
    *   **Share Count:** NVIDIA has a history of buybacks. I will project a net **1.0% annual reduction in shares outstanding** to model the net effect of repurchases and dilution from SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Calculation:** FCFF is calculated as:
    `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD, in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 30.0% | 22.0% | 15.0% | 10.0% | 8.0% |
| Revenue | $193,070 | $235,545 | $270,876 | $297,964 | $321,801 |
| EBIT (55.0% of Revenue) | $106,188 | $129,550 | $148,982 | $163,880 | $176,991 |
| EBIAT (at 85%) | $90,260 | $110,117 | $126,635 | $139,298 | $150,442 |
| (+) D&A (1.4% of Rev) | $2,703 | $3,298 | $3,792 | $4,171 | $4,505 |
| (-) SBC (3.5% of Rev) | ($6,757) | ($8,244) | ($9,481) | ($10,429) | ($11,263) |
| (-) Capex (3.0% of Rev) | ($5,792) | ($7,066) | ($8,126) | ($8,939) | ($9,654) |
| (-) Change in NWC | ($2,228) | ($2,124) | ($1,767) | ($1,354) | ($1,192) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$78,186** | **$95,981** | **$110,053** | **$122,747** | **$132,838** |

13. **FCFF Rationale:** I use Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) as it represents cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure changes.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** `Cost of Equity = RFR + Beta * ERP`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate (RFR):** **4.33%**, based on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield (August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**, a standard assumption for the U.S. market.
    *   **Beta:** **2.14** (5-Year Monthly Beta). This high beta reflects NVDA's significant volatility and systematic risk relative to the overall market, which is appropriate for a high-growth technology stock.
    *   **Cost of Equity** = 4.33% + 2.14 * 5.0% = **15.03%**

15. **Cost of Debt:** TTM Interest Expense ($246M) / Total Debt ($10,285M) = **2.39%**. After a 15% tax shield, the after-tax cost of debt is **2.03%**.

16. **WACC Calculation:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)`
    *   Market Value of Equity (E) = $4,316,585M
    *   Market Value of Debt (D) = $10,285M
    *   **WACC** = (4317/4327) * 15.03% + (10/4327) * 2.03% = **14.99%** (rounded to 15.0%)

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Gordon Growth Method:** `TV = FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This rate is a reasonable proxy for long-term global GDP growth and inflation.
    *   **Terminal Value** = $132,838 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.15 - 0.025) = **$1,088,272M**

18. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($176,991M) + Year 5 D&A ($4,505M) = $181,496M
    *   Gordon Growth Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple = $1,088,272M / $181,496M = **6.0x**
    *   **Reasoning:** A 6.0x exit multiple is very conservative and potentially unrealistic for a company of NVIDIA's caliber, even in maturity. However, given the extremely high growth rates being discounted at a high WACC, the Gordon Growth model produces this result mathematically. For this conservative base case, I will adhere to the Gordon Growth method, acknowledging that it implies a low exit multiple.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFFs = $78,186/(1.15)^1 + ... + $132,838/(1.15)^5 = **$376,966M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $1,088,272 / (1.15)^5 = **$541,048M**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value** = $376,966M + $541,048M = **$918,014M**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Equity Value = $918,014M - ($10,285M Debt - $53,691M Cash) = **$961,420M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Y5 Shares = 24,734M * (1 - 0.01)^5 = **23,514M**
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value** = $961,420M / 23,514M shares = **$40.89**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $40.89**. (Assumes 18.9% 5-yr CAGR, 55% op margin)
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $29.50**. (Assumes lower 14% 5-yr revenue CAGR and margin compression to 50%)
    *   **High/Bull Case: $55.00**. (Assumes higher 24% 5-yr revenue CAGR and margins remain near peak at 58%)

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a margin of safety.
    *   **MOS Price** = $40.89 * (1 - 0.30) = **$28.62**

**Risk Notes**

1.  **Valuation Risk:** The current market price has priced in exceptionally high growth for many years. Any failure to meet these lofty expectations could lead to a significant stock price correction.
2.  **Competitive Risk:** As the AI hardware market matures, competition from other major tech firms (AMD, Intel, and hyperscale cloud providers' custom silicon) is likely to intensify, potentially pressuring margins.
3.  **Geopolitical Risk:** A significant portion of NVIDIA's supply chain and revenue is tied to regions with geopolitical tensions (e.g., Taiwan for manufacturing, China for sales). Any disruption could materially impact operations.
4.  **Cyclicality Risk:** Demand for GPUs and data center hardware can be cyclical. A slowdown in enterprise or consumer spending could impact growth.
5.  **Regulatory Risk:** Increased scrutiny from regulators globally regarding antitrust concerns and the sale of advanced chips to certain countries could pose headwinds.
