### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On February 19, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $500.0 million of the company's common stock. This program replaces the previous $300.0 million program approved in 2022.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, with a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects and can create a floor for the stock price.
*   **Timing:** The program was approved on February 19, 2025, and has no expiration date. Significant repurchases are likely to occur over the next 12 months, depending on market conditions.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $150 million worth of shares. At an average price of $175/share, this would be ~857,000 shares, or ~1.3% of the 66.6 million shares outstanding as of December 31, 2024.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $250 million worth of shares. At an average price of $175/share, this would be ~1.43 million shares, or ~2.2% of shares outstanding.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases $400 million worth of shares. At an average price of $175/share, this would be ~2.29 million shares, or ~3.4% of shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (+2-5%). The repurchase program is a positive signal and will provide support for the stock, but the impact will be spread out over time.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a history of executing on its repurchase programs and has a strong cash position.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price and market conditions will influence the timing and volume of repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchases in 10-Q and 10-K filings.
    *   Company announcements regarding the repurchase program.
    *   Daily trading volume and stock price.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   A deterioration in the company's financial performance could lead to a suspension of the program.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of share repurchases in quarterly filings.

**2. Catalyst Title:** New Restaurant Openings

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company plans to open approximately 30 new company-owned restaurants in 2025. This is a continuation of their steady unit growth strategy.
*   **Mechanism:** New restaurants contribute to revenue and earnings growth. The market values growth, and successful new openings demonstrate the continued appeal of the brand and the company's ability to execute its growth strategy.
*   **Timing:** Throughout 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 25 new restaurants opened in 2025. This would represent a ~3.8% increase in the company-owned restaurant base of 666 as of December 31, 2024.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 30 new restaurants opened in 2025, a ~4.5% increase.
    *   **High Scenario:** 35 new restaurants opened in 2025, a ~5.3% increase.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+5-15%). New unit growth is a key driver of the company's valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a strong track record of meeting or exceeding its restaurant opening targets.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Availability of suitable real estate, construction timelines, and permitting.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Company press releases announcing new restaurant openings.
    *   Quarterly and annual reports detailing the number of new restaurants opened.
    *   Management commentary on the development pipeline in earnings calls.

*   **Mechanism:** Bubba's 33 is a second growth engine for the company. Successful expansion of this concept would diversify the company's revenue stream and demonstrate its ability to incubate and scale new brands.
*   **Timing:** 2026-2030.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 8-10 Bubba's 33 openings per year.

    *   **High Scenario:** 15-20 Bubba's 33 openings per year.

*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. Management seems committed to the concept, but the pace of expansion is still to be determined.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong performance of existing Bubba's 33 locations, availability of real estate, and successful execution of the expansion plan.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Number of Bubba's 33 openings each year.
    *   Comparable sales growth for the Bubba's 33 segment.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. New Restaurant Openings**

*   **Assumption:** The market values each new Texas Roadhouse restaurant at a multiple of its average unit volume (AUV).
*   **Base Case:** 30 new restaurants in 2025. 2024 AUV was $8.488 million. At a conservative 0.5x AUV multiple, this adds ~$127 million in market value, or ~$1.91 per share.
*   **High Case:** 35 new restaurants. This would add ~$148 million in market value, or ~$2.22 per share.

**2. Bubba's 33 Expansion**

*   **Assumption:** The market assigns a value to the Bubba's 33 concept based on its future growth potential.
*   **Base Case:** 12 new Bubba's 33 openings per year for the next 5 years. 2024 AUV for Bubba's 33 was $6.276 million. At a 0.4x AUV multiple, this adds ~$301 million in market value, or ~$4.52 per share over 5 years.
*   **High Case:** 18 new Bubba's 33 openings per year. This would add ~$452 million in market value, or ~$6.79 per share over 5 years.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for Texas Roadhouse is positive. The company's consistent execution of its restaurant opening plan, coupled with a significant share repurchase authorization, should provide a tailwind for the stock over the next 0-12 months. While inflationary pressures are a concern, the company has a strong track record of managing costs and maintaining its value proposition with consumers.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Economic Downturn:** A significant recession could lead to a sharp decline in consumer discretionary spending, impacting traffic and sales at all of the company's restaurants.
2.  **Major Food Safety Incident:** A foodborne illness outbreak linked to Texas Roadhouse could severely damage the brand's reputation and lead to a loss of customer trust.
3.  **Intensified Competition:** Increased competition from other casual dining chains or new entrants could put pressure on Texas Roadhouse's market share and pricing power.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

We recommend a "Buy" rating for Texas Roadhouse. The company's consistent execution, strong brand loyalty, and multiple avenues for growth provide a compelling investment case. The most significant near-term catalyst is the continued rollout of new restaurants, which we believe can drive 5-15% upside in the stock over the next 12 months. The most important indicator to monitor will be the company's ability to maintain its restaurant-level margins in the face of inflationary pressures.

### **12) Final Rating**

catalyst score is 4 / 5
