### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dutch Bros emphasizes its people-first culture and its commitment to its employees, whom it calls "broistas." While the company faces the same labor challenges as the broader restaurant industry, including rising minimum wages, it has taken steps to offset these pressures, such as implementing price increases and focusing on productivity. Without specific data on employee turnover or satisfaction, it is difficult to definitively assess the quality of labor relations.

**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dutch Bros' drive-thru-only model is a key differentiator in the coffee industry, allowing for faster service and lower overhead costs compared to traditional coffee shops.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dutch Bros is clearly focused on long-term growth, as evidenced by its aggressive expansion plans and its goal of reaching 2,029 shops by 2029. The company is investing heavily in new store openings and infrastructure to support its growth, which may impact short-term profitability but is essential for building a sustainable, long-term business.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dutch Bros generated positive free cash flow in the first half of 2025, a significant improvement from the same period in the previous year. The company has a healthy balance sheet and access to a revolving credit facility to fund its expansion plans. While future equity financing cannot be completely ruled out, the company's current financial position appears strong enough to support its growth in the near to medium term.

**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**

Dutch Bros scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its growth potential, sales organization, and management team. The company's unique business model and strong brand identity give it a competitive edge in the crowded coffee market. The primary area for improvement is in providing more transparency around its labor and personnel relations. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its expansion into new markets, the performance of its CPG products, and its ability to manage rising labor and commodity costs. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with the disclosure of employee turnover rates, employee satisfaction surveys, or other concrete data demonstrating the quality of its "people-first" culture.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
