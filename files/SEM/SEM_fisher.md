**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K provides information on a broad team of executive officers beyond the CEO, including the heads of its various business segments. This indicates a distributed leadership structure and suggests that the company is not overly reliant on a single individual.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm"]("https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm") (Published: February 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited by a reputable firm, and the 10-K includes a statement on the effectiveness of their internal controls over financial reporting. There is no indication of any material weaknesses or significant accounting issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm"]("https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm") (Published: February 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key factor in the specialty hospital and outpatient rehabilitation industry is the ability to form and maintain strong relationships with major healthcare systems. Select Medical has a proven track record of successfully partnering with large, not-for-profit health systems, which provides a competitive advantage in terms of patient referrals and market presence.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm"]("https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm") (Published: February 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy of growth through acquisitions and joint ventures suggests a long-term focus. While they provide quarterly guidance, their capital allocation decisions indicate a willingness to invest in projects that may take time to generate significant returns.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, the company had a significant amount of debt. While they generate positive cash flow from operations, their growth initiatives are often financed through a combination of cash, debt, and sometimes, the issuance of non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. The potential for future equity financing cannot be ruled out, especially for larger acquisitions.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025021575/sem-20250331.htm"]("https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025021575/sem-20250331.htm") (Published: May 7, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's earnings call transcripts shows that management provides detailed updates on their performance and addresses questions from analysts. They discuss both positive and negative trends affecting their business, demonstrating a good level of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings does not reveal any material legal or regulatory issues that would bring the integrity of the management team into question. There are no disclosed related-party transactions that appear to be problematic.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm"]("https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1320414/000162828025006833/sem-20241231.htm") (Published: February 27, 2025)

Synthesis:
Select Medical Holdings Corporation scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly in areas related to its long-term growth potential, experienced management team, and solid industry position. The primary areas of concern are the lack of traditional R&D and the potential for equity dilution given the company's debt levels and acquisition-based growth strategy. Over the next 12-24 months, the score could be most impacted by the company's ability to successfully integrate new acquisitions and improve its profit margins in a challenging reimbursement environment. A significant improvement in free cash flow generation that reduces the need for external financing would likely flip the "No" on equity financing dilution to a "Yes."

fisher score is 13 / 15
