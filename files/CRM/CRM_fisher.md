**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for Salesforce is its extensive ecosystem, including the AppExchange, a marketplace for third-party applications that integrate with the Salesforce platform.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided SEC filings to suggest a lack of integrity within Salesforce's management. The company has a Code of Conduct that applies to all employees, including executive officers. However, the company is involved in ongoing litigation related to the activities of a former customer, Backpage.com. While Salesforce intends to defend its interests vigorously, the existence of this litigation introduces a degree of uncertainty.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Salesforce scores well on most of Fisher's 15 points, demonstrating a strong market position, commitment to innovation, and improving financial performance. The company's leadership in the CRM market, combined with its strategic push into AI and data, provides a long runway for growth. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of its AI strategy with Agentforce, continued margin improvement from its restructuring efforts, and the resolution of the ongoing Backpage-related litigation. A favorable outcome in the litigation and continued strong adoption and monetization of its new AI products would likely flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes" and solidify its position as a top-tier investment according to Fisher's principles.

fisher score is 14 / 15
