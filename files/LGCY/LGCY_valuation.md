Of course. Here is a revised and corrected version of the intrinsic valuation analysis for Legacy Education Inc. (LGCY). I have identified and fixed several issues, particularly concerning the rationale in the Reverse DCF and a terminal value that was overly conservative. The revised valuation uses more realistic assumptions that are neither idealistic nor overly pessimistic.

The analysis is presented in the same format as requested.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are currently reflected in LGCY's stock price.

**A) Baseline & Market Price**

*   **Current Market Price:** **$12.78** (per TradingView, Aug 22, 2025).

*   **Baseline Financials (TTM as of March 31, 2025)**
    The following table presents the Trailing Twelve Month financials, calculated from the most recent SEC filings.

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $59.0 | 10-Q (Q3'25), 10-K (FY'24) |
| Gross Margin | 43.5% | Inferred from TTM Revenue & COGS |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $8.8 | 10-Q (Q3'25), 10-K (FY'24) |
| Net Income | $7.3 | 10-Q (Q3'25), 10-K (FY'24) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $0.4 | 10-Q (Q3'25), 10-K (FY'24) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $2.2 | 10-Q (Q3'25), 10-K (FY'24) |
| Capital Expenditures | ($0.8) | 10-Q (Q3'25), 10-K (FY'24) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($7.7) | StockAnalysis TTM |
| Interest Expense | ($0.1) | 10-Q (Q3'25), 10-K (FY'24) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $17.3 | 10-Q (Q3'25) |
| Total Debt | $17.9 | StockAnalysis TTM |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 12.4M | 10-Q (as of May 10, 2025) |

**B) Reverse-Engineered Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of **$12.78**, which corresponds to an Enterprise Value of approximately $158.8 million, the market must believe the company can achieve a specific level of growth and profitability.

*   **Market-Implied Assumptions:** Holding the TTM operating margin of **14.9%** constant, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 16.5%**.

This growth rate represents a moderation from the company's recent historical 3-year CAGR of 25%, suggesting the market expects growth to slow from its aggressive acquisition-fueled pace but remain very strong.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on independent, realistic assumptions grounded in historical performance and future industry expectations.

**C) Formulation of Realistic Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Market-Implied | Analyst's Base-Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (CAGR)** | 16.5% | **12.0%** (tapering from 15% to 8%) | The market's implied rate is optimistic. While recent growth has been strong due to acquisitions (10-Q, p. F-13), a more realistic 12% CAGR is prudent, reflecting a natural moderation as the company scales. |
| **Operating Margin** | 14.9% (constant) | **14.0%** | The TTM margin is used as a baseline. A slight moderation to 14.0% is assumed to reflect potential integration costs and competitive pressures, which is more sustainable than assuming peak margins persist. |
| **Tax Rate** | 27.0% (TTM) | **28.0%** | Based on the average of the last two fiscal years (FY24: 26.8%, FY23: 31.0%) to normalize for fluctuations (StockAnalysis). |
| **Capex (% of Revenue)** | 1.3% (TTM) | **1.5%** | Slightly higher than the TTM average to account for necessary technology and facility investments required to support future growth. |
| **Change in NWC (% of Revenue Change)** | 13.1% (TTM) | **12.0%** | Modeled based on historical averages, assuming slightly improved working capital management as the company matures and gains operational efficiencies. |
| **SBC (% of Revenue)**| 3.7% (TTM) | **2.5%** | TTM SBC was elevated due to a large option grant (10-K, p. 69). A normalized rate of 2.5% is more realistic for future years, reflecting standard equity incentive programs. |
| **Diluted Share Count** | - | **Net 1.0% annual increase** | Assumes dilution from ongoing stock-based compensation will slightly outweigh any potential future buybacks, a common scenario for growing companies. |

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation. The formula subtracts Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) as it represents a real economic cost to shareholders via dilution.
*Formula: FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC*

**FCFF Build (Years 1-5, USD Millions)**
| Metric | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 15.0% | 13.0% | 11.0% | 9.0% | 8.0% |
| **Revenue** | **$67.8** | **$76.6** | **$85.1** | **$92.7** | **$100.1** |
| EBIT (14.0% Margin) | $9.5 | $10.7 | $11.9 | $13.0 | $14.0 |
| Tax on EBIT | ($2.7) | ($3.0) | ($3.3) | ($3.6) | ($3.9) |
| NOPAT | $6.8 | $7.7 | $8.6 | $9.3 | $10.1 |
| D&A | $0.4 | $0.5 | $0.5 | $0.6 | $0.6 |
| SBC | ($1.7) | ($1.9) | ($2.1) | ($2.3) | ($2.5) |
| Capex | ($1.0) | ($1.1) | ($1.3) | ($1.4) | ($1.5) |
| Change in NWC | ($1.1) | ($1.0) | ($1.0) | ($0.9) | ($0.9) |
| **FCFF** | **$3.4** | **$4.1** | **$4.6** | **$5.2** | **$5.8** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0% (Standard assumption for U.S. market).
    *   **Beta:** 1.09 (per TradingView). This reflects market-average systematic risk, appropriate for a company in a stable but competitive industry.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.09 * 5.0% = **9.70%***
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   The effective rate of 0.56% (Interest/Debt) is misleadingly low. Using a synthetic credit rating based on interest coverage (EBIT/Interest = 88x), a pre-tax cost of debt of **5.5%** is assumed, reflecting a high-quality credit profile.
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (Market Cap) = $12.78 * 12.4M shares = $158.5M
    *   Market Value of Debt = $17.9M
    *   *WACC = (158.5 / 176.4) * 9.70% + (17.9 / 176.4) * 5.5% * (1 - 0.28) = **9.11%***

**F) Terminal Value (Exit Multiple Method)**

The Exit Multiple method is used as it better reflects how the market would likely value the company at the end of the forecast period, based on its earnings power relative to industry peers.

*   **Year 5 EBITDA Calculation:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $14.0M + $0.6M = **$14.6M**
*   **Selected EV/EBITDA Multiple:** **8.0x**
    *   **Rationale:** The Gordon Growth method's implied 6.2x multiple is too conservative for a company projected to still be growing at 8% with stable margins. An 8.0x multiple is more realistic, aligning with historical sector averages for mature, moderately growing educational service companies. This provides a more balanced terminal value.
*   **Terminal Value Calculation:**
    *   *Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $14.6M * 8.0x = **$116.8M***

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   PV of 5-Year FCFF = $3.1M + $3.4M + $3.6M + $3.7M + $3.8M = **$17.6M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $116.8M / (1 + 9.11%)^5 = **$75.4M**
    *   *Enterprise Value = $17.6M + $75.4M = **$93.0M***
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $17.9M - $17.3M = $0.6M (from TTM Balance Sheet)
    *   *Equity Value = $93.0M - $0.6M = **$92.4M***

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Year 5 Share Count:** 12.4M * (1 + 1.0%)^5 = **13.0M shares**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *$92.4M / 13.0M shares = **$7.11 per share***

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$7.11** (12% CAGR, 14% margin, 8.0x exit multiple).
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$4.95** (8% CAGR, 13% margin, 7.0x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$9.80** (15% CAGR, 15% margin, 9.0x exit multiple).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for unforeseen risks.
    *   *MOS Price = $7.11 * (1 - 0.30) = **$4.98***

**Risk Notes**

The primary risks to this valuation include: 1) **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The for-profit education sector is subject to intense regulation from the Department of Education, particularly concerning the "90/10 Rule" and gainful employment standards, which could impact Title IV funding eligibility. 2) **Competition:** The company faces significant competition from both public and other private post-secondary institutions, which could pressure tuition rates and enrollment growth. 3) **Integration Risk:** Recent growth has been driven by acquisitions; failure to successfully integrate new schools could lead to higher-than-expected costs and operational inefficiencies, compressing margins.

final answer is 7.11 $
