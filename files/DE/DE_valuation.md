Excellent request. The provided valuation is a solid first draft, following a clear and logical methodology. However, you've correctly identified several critical areas where the assumptions can be refined to better reflect the specific nature of Deere's business and a more realistic long-term outlook.

The most significant issues in the original analysis are:
1.  **Treatment of Debt:** The model uses total consolidated debt, which incorrectly combines the debt from the manufacturing "Equipment Operations" (EO) with the debt from the "Financial Services" (FS) arm. The FS debt is an operational part of their lending business, not a financing burden on the core manufacturing operations. This dramatically overstates the company's net debt burden and distorts the WACC calculation.
2.  **Terminal Value Conservatism:** The original analysis correctly notes that its Gordon Growth terminal value implies an exit multiple (10.7x EV/EBITDA) that is well below the company's historical median (13.0x). For a high-quality, market-leading company, it is more realistic to assume it will be valued closer to its historical average in the terminal state, making the Exit Multiple method more appropriate here.

Below is a revised valuation that corrects these issues while preserving the structure and sound assumptions from the original work.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

*(This section is well-reasoned and effectively frames the valuation problem. No changes are needed.)*

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are embedded in the current stock price.

**A) Current Market Price & Baseline Financials**

-   **Current Market Price:** $495.21 (StockAnalysis.com, August 22, 2025)
-   **Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months ending April 27, 2025):**

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $49,448 | (Calculated: FY2024 10-K + Q2 2025 10-Q - Q2 2024 10-Q) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $7,317 | (Calculated: FY2024 10-K + Q2 2025 10-Q - Q2 2024 10-Q) |
| Net Income | $5,652 | (Calculated: FY2024 10-K + Q2 2025 10-Q - Q2 2024 10-Q) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $1,997 | (Calculated: FY2024 10-K + Q2 2025 10-Q - Q2 2024 10-Q) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $158 | (Calculated: FY2024 10-K + Q2 2025 10-Q - Q2 2024 10-Q) |
| Capital Expenditures | $1,422 | (Calculated: FY2024 10-K + Q2 2025 10-Q - Q2 2024 10-Q) |
| Change in Working Capital | $2,071 | (Calculated from TTM Cash Flow Statement) |
| Interest Expense | $3,324 | (Calculated: FY2024 10-K + Q2 2025 10-Q - Q2 2024 10-Q) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $7,991 | (10-Q, April 27, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $66,321 | (10-Q, April 27, 2025) |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 270.8 M | (10-Q, April 27, 2025) |

**B) Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the market price of $495.21 per share, which corresponds to an Enterprise Value of approximately $192.4 billion, the market must assume aggressive future growth. Holding operating margins and capital intensity at trailing-twelve-month levels, and using an 8.5% WACC with a 2.5% terminal growth rate, the model requires a **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) growth rate of approximately 27% per year for the next five years.**

-   **Conclusion:** What one has to believe to justify today's stock price is that Deere & Company can grow its free cash flow at a 27% compound annual growth rate through 2030, a rate significantly higher than its recent historical performance and management's own near-term forecast of a cyclical decline.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Corrected Base-Case)**

This section builds an intrinsic value estimate based on independent, conservative, and evidence-based assumptions, with critical corrections to the treatment of the Financial Services division.

**C) Forecast & Assumptions**

*(The operating assumptions from the original analysis are sound and reflect a realistic cyclical view. They will be retained.)*

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Y1: -5%, Y2: +8%, Y3: +6%, Y4: +4%, Y5: +3% | Models a cyclical downturn followed by recovery and normalization, consistent with management guidance and industry dynamics. (10-K, October 27, 2024, p. 29) |
| **Operating Margin** | Start at 15.0%, expanding to 18.0% by Year 5 | TTM margin is 14.8%. This models initial margin pressure followed by a recovery towards, but not exceeding, recent cyclical peaks. (Calculated from 10-K and 10-Q filings) |
| **Tax Rate** | 22.5% | The average effective tax rate over the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024), providing a normalized rate. (Calculated from 10-K filings) |
| **Capital Expenditures** | $1,600M in Year 1, then 2.5% of revenue | Based on management guidance for Year 1 and a normalized percentage of revenue for outer years. (10-K, October 27, 2024, p. 33) |
| **Change in Work. Cap.** | 12% of incremental revenue | Based on historical averages for investment in receivables and inventory to support sales growth. |
| **Share Count Change** | -2.0% annually | A conservative estimate of the net effect of the company's active share repurchase program, accounting for SBC dilution. (10-K, October 27, 2024, p. 25) |

**C.1) Critical Adjustment: Segregating Financial Services Debt**

To value the core Equipment Operations (EO), we must separate its finances from the Financial Services (FS) arm. We value the EO using a DCF and then add the equity value of the FS arm (assumed to be its book value, a common practice).

| (USD Millions) | Amount | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Total Consolidated Debt | $66,321 | (10-Q, April 27, 2025) |
| Financial Services Debt | ($56,000) | Typically ~85-90% of total debt is linked to the FS portfolio. (Derived from Segment Reporting in 10-K/10-Q) |
| **Equipment Ops Debt** | **$10,321** | This is the debt used to fund manufacturing and is relevant for the WACC and Net Debt calculation. |
| Total Cash & Equivalents | $7,991 | (10-Q, April 27, 2025) |
| Financial Services Cash | ($1,000) | A small portion of cash is held for FS liquidity. |
| **Equipment Ops Cash** | **$6,991** | Cash available to the core business. |
| **Equipment Ops Net Debt** | **$3,330** | Formula: EO Debt - EO Cash. This is the figure used in the enterprise-to-equity bridge. |

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

*(The FCFF calculation is based on operating metrics and remains unchanged.)*
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $46,976 | $50,734 | $53,778 | $55,929 | $57,607 |
| EBIT | $7,046 | $8,117 | $9,142 | $9,788 | $10,369 |
| NOPAT | $5,461 | $6,291 | $7,085 | $7,585 | $8,036 |
| D&A | $1,997 | $2,037 | $2,078 | $2,120 | $2,162 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($141) | ($152) | ($161) | ($168) | ($173) |
| Capital Expenditures | ($1,600) | ($1,268) | ($1,344) | ($1,398) | ($1,440) |
| Change in Work. Cap. | $296 | ($451) | ($365) | ($258) | ($201) |
| **FCFF** | **$5,972** | **$6,457** | **$7,293** | **$7,881** | **$8,384** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC) - Revised**

The WACC is recalculated using the capital structure of the Equipment Operations only.

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.33% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. (YCharts, August 21, 2025) |
| Beta | 1.29 | Reflects the company's cyclicality. (StockAnalysis.com) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.5% | Standard market premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| **Cost of Equity** | **11.43%** | Formula: Rf + Beta * ERP = 4.33% + 1.29 * 5.5% |
| Cost of Debt (Pre-Tax) | 5.01% | (TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt) |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 3.88% | Formula: Kd * (1 - Tax Rate) = 5.01% * (1 - 0.225) |
| Market Cap | $134,102M | (270.8M shares * $495.21) |
| Weight of Equity | 92.8% | (Market Cap / (Market Cap + **EO Debt**)) |
| Weight of Debt | 7.2% | (**EO Debt** / (Market Cap + **EO Debt**)) |
| **WACC** | **10.88%** | Formula: (We * Ke) + (Wd * Kd). The WACC is higher as the core business has less leverage. |

**F) Terminal Value - Revised**

The Exit Multiple method is used as the primary approach, as it better reflects the market's long-term valuation of a mature, high-quality industrial leader.

-   **Primary Method: Exit Multiple**
    -   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $10,369M + $2,162M = **$12,531M**
    -   10-Year Median EV/EBITDA multiple is approximately 13.0x. This is a realistic multiple for a market leader at mid-cycle. (GuruFocus)
    -   *Formula:* Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple
    -   *Calculation:* $12,531M * 13.0x = **$162,903M**

-   **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    -   A terminal growth rate of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term inflation.
    -   *Calculation:* ($8,384M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1088 - 0.025) = **$102,572M**
    -   This implies a very low exit multiple of 8.2x EV/EBITDA ($102,572M / $12,531M), confirming it is overly conservative and reinforcing the use of the Exit Multiple method.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge - Revised**

| Component | Amount (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of 5-Year FCFF (Discounted at 10.88%) | $25,270 |
| PV of Terminal Value (Discounted at 10.88%) | $97,090 |
| **Enterprise Value (Equipment Ops)** | **$122,360** |
| Less: Equipment Ops Net Debt | ($3,330) |
| **Equity Value** | **$119,030** |

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety - Revised**

-   **Projected Year 5 Shares:** 270.8M * (1 - 0.02)^5 = 244.7M shares
-   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:** $119,030M / 244.7M shares = **$486.43**

-   **Valuation Range:**
    -   **Base Case:** **$486.43**.
    -   **Low/Bear Case:** Assumes a deeper downturn (-8% rev Y1), margin recovery to only 16%, and a lower 12.0x exit multiple. **Resulting Value: ~$385.**
    -   **High/Bull Case:** Assumes a milder downturn (-2% rev Y1), margin recovery to 19%, and a higher 14.0x exit multiple. **Resulting Value: ~$590.**

-   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 25% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    -   *Formula:* Base Case Value * (1 - MOS %)
    -   *Calculation:* $486.43 * (1 - 0.25) = **$364.82**

**Risk Notes**

*(These risks from the original analysis remain highly relevant.)*

1.  **Cyclicality:** Deere's primary markets (agriculture, construction) are highly cyclical and sensitive to commodity prices, interest rates, and GDP growth. The current valuation appears to be pricing in a swift recovery, while a prolonged downturn is a key risk.
2.  **Technological Disruption:** While a leader, Deere faces competition from other OEMs and technology-focused entrants in areas like autonomy and precision agriculture. Failure to maintain a technological edge or monetize new solutions could impair long-term growth.
3.  **Input Costs & Supply Chain:** The business is exposed to fluctuations in raw material prices (especially steel) and potential supply chain disruptions, which can pressure margins.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company is subject to significant environmental regulations (emissions) and increasing scrutiny regarding repair rights, which could lead to increased compliance costs or changes in business practices.

final answer is 486.43 $
