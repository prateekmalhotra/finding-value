Company: Sabra Health Care REIT, Inc. (SBRA)
Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K filed February 19, 2025 (for FY 2024), Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (May 6, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sabra's portfolio of healthcare real estate, primarily skilled nursing and senior housing, is positioned to benefit from powerful, long-term demographic trends. The number of Americans aged 75 and older is projected to grow at a 10.1% compound annual growth rate between 2022 and 2035. Furthermore, national expenditures on nursing home care are projected to grow from $209 billion in 2023 to $337 billion in 2032, a 5.4% compound annual growth rate. This creates a durable demand runway for Sabra's assets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sabra's management demonstrates a clear strategy for growth beyond its current portfolio through disciplined acquisitions, development, and portfolio recycling. The company's 2024 10-K outlines a strategy to "grow our investment portfolio while diversifying" through acquisitions and the "development of purpose-built healthcare facilities with select developers." This includes a proprietary development pipeline strategy where Sabra originates loans or makes preferred equity investments that include an option to purchase the underlying real estate upon stabilization, providing a future growth path.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a REIT, "R&D" is analogous to its investment underwriting and capital allocation process. While Sabra's management highlights its "disciplined approach" and "significant experience" in its filings, there are no specific, verifiable metrics disclosed (e.g., historical return on invested capital, acquisition yields vs. peers) that would allow for an objective assessment of its effectiveness relative to its size or competitors. Without concrete performance data on its investment decisions, effectiveness cannot be confirmed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a REIT, the "sales organization" translates to its ability to source deals and manage tenant/operator relationships. Sabra emphasizes its "extensive network of relationships with qualified local, regional and national operators," which helps it source investment opportunities. As of December 31, 2024, the company maintained relationships with 60 operators. Occupancy rates for its stabilized portfolio in 2024 were 80.9% for skilled nursing and 89.6% for senior housing-leased, showing solid demand. However, without direct, recent comparisons to peers' deal flow and leasing spreads, an "above-average" designation cannot be definitively supported by the available evidence.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sabra generates solid, though not spectacular, profit margins, measured by Funds From Operations (FFO). For the full year 2024, Sabra reported FFO of $321.6 million on total revenues of $703.2 million, yielding an FFO margin of approximately 45.7%. While this is a substantial margin, it is generally in line with or slightly below some of its larger healthcare REIT peers, preventing a clear "Yes" answer. The margin reflects a profitable business model but not one that demonstrably and consistently outperforms the industry.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively engaged in improving margins through portfolio optimization. In 2024, Sabra sold 18 properties for $96.0 million as part of an "initiative to recycle capital and further improve our portfolio quality." This strategy aims to dispose of underperforming or non-strategic assets and reinvest the proceeds into higher-growth opportunities. Additionally, the company's triple-net lease structure provides contractual rent escalators, many of which are tied to inflation, helping to protect margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sabra, a company with 50 full-time employees as of year-end 2024, appears to have excellent personnel relations. The company's 10-K filing highlights its culture, competitive compensation, and work-life balance initiatives. Crucially, it notes that "98% of participants in our most recent survey would recommend Sabra as a great place to work," which is a strong, quantifiable indicator of high employee satisfaction. None of its employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team demonstrates stability and significant industry experience. CEO Richard Matros has over 40 years of experience, while the CFO and CIO both have over 20 years of experience. This long tenure at the highest levels suggests a stable and cohesive management team. Information incorporated by reference from the proxy statement would provide further detail, but the stability and deep experience outlined in the 10-K are strong positive indicators.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sabra's leadership extends beyond the CEO. The 2024 10-K explicitly names and describes the extensive experience of its Chief Financial Officer, Michael Costa, and its Chief Investment Officer, Talya Nevo-Hacohen. This demonstrates a strong second layer of executive management with decades of relevant real estate, finance, and healthcare industry experience, suggesting the company is not solely reliant on its CEO for strategic direction and execution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sabra's accounting controls appear robust. In its Annual Report for 2024, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was audited by the independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which issued an unqualified opinion, stating that the company "maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting." There is no history of material restatements noted.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator for Sabra is its strategic focus and expertise in the skilled nursing facility (SNF) sector, complemented by a growing senior housing portfolio. While larger peers are more diversified, Sabra's deep operational understanding of the complex SNF reimbursement and regulatory environment allows it to identify and partner with strong regional operators. The company's ability to transition assets between operators, such as the 2023 transition of facilities from North American Health Care to Ensign and Avamere, demonstrates proactive asset management that is critical in this industry. This operational expertise is a competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a willingness to prioritize long-term portfolio health over short-term earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the company recognized a net loss on the sale of real estate of $76.6 million, a significant hit to GAAP earnings. This was the result of a deliberate capital recycling program to dispose of weaker assets. This action, while detrimental to short-term results, improves the quality and long-term growth profile of the remaining portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sabra relies on a mix of funding sources for growth, including equity. The company has an active at-the-market (ATM) equity offering program, under which it raised $89.2 million in net proceeds during 2024 by issuing 6.0 million shares. This represented a ~2.6% increase in shares outstanding. While this level of issuance is not extreme for a REIT, the ongoing use of the ATM program indicates that external equity is a necessary component of its funding strategy for the foreseeable future, meaning growth is not funded solely by retained cash flow and debt.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of earnings call transcripts indicates a high degree of transparency. For example, in the Q1 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed the specific challenges facing the senior housing operating portfolio, such as elevated operating expenses, and detailed the specific headwinds from tenants like Holiday. They also address difficult topics head-on in the Q&A sessions. This willingness to discuss both positive and negative developments in detail demonstrates a high level of candor with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags suggesting a lack of integrity. A review of the company's 2024 10-K reveals no material legal proceedings that would question management's character. The company has a code of conduct, and the financial statements have received a clean audit opinion from its independent auditor. The section on related-party transactions, incorporated by reference from the proxy statement, would provide final confirmation, but based on the primary filings, there is no evidence to question the integrity of the management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1492298/000149229825000008/sbra-20241231.htm'] (February 19, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
Sabra scores well on Fisher's qualitative points, particularly those related to management quality, integrity, and long-range planning. The company is poised to benefit from strong demographic tailwinds and is actively improving its portfolio quality through strategic dispositions and reinvestments. The strongest positive attributes are its clear growth runway in healthcare real estate, a stable and experienced management team, and excellent internal personnel relations. The primary weaknesses identified relate to a lack of clear, quantifiable evidence of outperformance versus peers in areas like investment effectiveness (R&D) and profit margins.

The Fisher score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables. First, a sustained improvement in occupancy and operating margins within its Senior Housing - Managed portfolio could provide the evidence needed to flip the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" point to 'Yes'. Second, the success of its capital recycling program—demonstrating that proceeds from dispositions are reinvested into clearly higher-returning assets—could provide the data to affirm its "R&D" effectiveness. Evidence of acquisition yields meaningfully exceeding those of peers or a clear trend of rising portfolio-wide operator rent coverage would be catalysts to flip a "No" to a "Yes".

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
