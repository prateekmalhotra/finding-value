Ingles Markets, Incorporated, August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 28, 2024.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles is a regional supermarket chain operating in the mature and highly competitive grocery industry. The company's strategy focuses on remodeling existing stores and occasionally building new ones within its six-state footprint, rather than aggressive geographic expansion. The store count has remained flat at 198 from fiscal year 2022 to 2024. While the addition of services like fuel stations and online ordering provides incremental growth, the overall market position and strategy do not suggest the potential for a "sizable" increase in sales for several years, but rather steady, low-single-digit growth.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a consistent commitment to reinvesting in the business to drive future sales. The company's capital expenditure plan for fiscal 2025 is approximately $120 to $160 million, targeted at store improvements, remodeling, and technology upgrades. Ingles is also adapting to consumer trends by expanding its "Ingles Curbside" online ordering and pickup service, now available at 134 stores, and increasing its focus on organic and locally-sourced products.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm) (February 6, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a supermarket operator, Ingles does not have a dedicated R&D function or report any associated expenses. Innovations, such as the development of private label product lines ("Laura Lynn" and "Harvest Farms") or the implementation of new retail technologies, are embedded within general corporate and capital spending. Without specific metrics on the output or spending related to these efforts, it is not possible to assess their effectiveness relative to the company's size or competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm) (February 6, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent sales performance does not indicate an above-average organization. For the 52 weeks of fiscal year 2024, retail grocery comparable store sales (excluding fuel) decreased by 1.7% compared to the corresponding period in fiscal 2023. The number of transactions also decreased by 0.3%. In a highly competitive industry, declining comparable sales suggest the company's sales and marketing efforts, including its "Ingles Advantage Card" loyalty program, are not currently outperforming the market.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles' profit margins have recently declined. For fiscal year 2024, the company's gross margin was 23.0% and its operating margin was 2.6%, down from 23.8% and 5.0%, respectively, in fiscal 2023. The decline was due in part to a $30.4 million inventory loss and a $4.5 million asset impairment charge from Hurricane Helene. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the gross margin was 23.4% and the operating margin was a narrow 1.8%. This recent trend of margin compression points to challenges in profitability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm) (February 6, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles employs several strategies to manage its margins. The company operates its own milk processing and packaging plant and a centralized distribution center that supplies approximately 58% of its goods, providing control over costs and supply. The company also emphasizes its private label brands, which typically yield higher margins than national brands. Additionally, Ingles reduces distribution costs by using its truck fleet for back-haul opportunities, transporting goods for third parties on return trips.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states that "Management considers labor relations to be good," with approximately 26,360 associates as of September 28, 2024. However, it also acknowledges challenges in the labor market, noting that "competition for labor has become more intense, resulting in higher costs to attract and retain associates." Without external data on employee turnover, satisfaction, or engagement, it is difficult to validate that relations are "outstanding" as per Fisher's high standard. The available information is neutral and not compellingly positive.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Executive relations appear stable but are dominated by high insider control. Chairman Robert P. Ingle II beneficially owned approximately 72.5% of the company's combined voting power as of September 28, 2024. This concentrated ownership ensures management stability and prevents hostile takeovers. However, it also makes Ingles a "controlled company" under NASDAQ rules, exempting it from corporate governance standards such as requiring a majority-independent board, which is a negative from a minority shareholder's perspective.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public filings identify its CEO and CFO but provide limited information about the broader management team or succession planning. The significant voting control held by the Chairman, Robert P. Ingle II, creates a key-person risk. The lack of disclosure regarding the experience and responsibilities of other key operational leaders makes it impossible to confirm that the company has sufficient management depth to navigate future challenges without heavy reliance on its chairman.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm) (February 6, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles appears to have strong accounting controls. The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. Furthermore, in its 10-K filing, management concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There are no reports of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key distinguishing feature for Ingles in the retail industry is its extensive real estate ownership. As of September 28, 2024, the company owned 175 of its 198 supermarkets, 101 shopping centers (where it is the anchor tenant), its corporate headquarters, its 1.65 million square-foot distribution facility, and its milk processing plant. This high degree of ownership provides significant financial stability, reduces exposure to lease renewals and rent inflation, and represents a substantial base of tangible assets, setting it apart from many competitors who primarily lease their locations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions suggest a long-range focus. The strategy of owning the vast majority of its real estate is a clear long-term decision that prioritizes asset control and stability over short-term returns. The company consistently reinvests in its store base, with a planned capital expenditure budget of $120-$160 million for fiscal 2025, to maintain modern and competitive facilities. These decisions indicate a willingness to deploy capital for long-term durability rather than focusing on short-term profit maximization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm) (February 6, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is robust. As of December 28, 2024, Ingles held $269.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company generated $262.5 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2024 and has a $150.0 million line of credit that was undrawn. This strong liquidity is more than sufficient to cover the planned fiscal 2025 capital expenditures of $120 to $160 million, making the need for dilutive equity financing highly unlikely.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm) (February 6, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's communication with the broader investment community is minimal. Ingles has not hosted a public earnings call since May 2016, which severely limits the opportunity for investors to engage with management. While its SEC filings contain required disclosures, including discussion of negative events like Hurricane Helene, this one-way communication does not meet Fisher's standard of talking freely with investors. The lack of regular, interactive forums is a significant negative on this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IMKTA/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IMKTA/transcripts/) (August 23, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm) (December 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049325000005/imkt-20241228x10q.htm) (February 6, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent SEC filings does not reveal any significant red flags that would question the integrity of management. The company reports that it is subject to various legal proceedings common in the ordinary course of business but does not expect them to have a material impact. Governance is characterized by the high voting control of the chairman, but there are no disclosed material related-party transactions, accounting scandals, or regulatory actions that would indicate a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis:**
Ingles Markets presents a mixed profile under Fisher's framework. The company's strongest positives are its fortress-like balance sheet, industry-differentiating real estate ownership, and disciplined capital allocation focused on long-term stability. These factors, combined with strong accounting controls and management integrity, create a durable, low-risk business. However, its negatives are significant: it operates in a slow-growth, competitive industry, has recently seen sales and margins decline, and suffers from a near-total lack of investor communication. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company demonstrates a return to positive comparable store sales growth and margin stabilization as it recovers from the impacts of Hurricane Helene. Flipping the "No" on "Candor with Investors" would require a fundamental change in corporate culture, specifically the initiation of regular quarterly earnings calls.

**fisher score is 7 / 15**
