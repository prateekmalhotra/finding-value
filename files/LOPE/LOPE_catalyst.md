### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On January 29, 2025, the company's Board of Directors approved a $200 million increase to the existing stock repurchase program. The company repurchased 416,497 shares in Q4 2024 for $64.8 million and another 226,258 shares after December 31, 2024.
*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, with a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects and can create a floor for the stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company repurchases $100 million worth of shares.
    *   **Base Case:** The company repurchases $200 million worth of shares.
    *   **High Case:** The company repurchases the full authorization plus an additional authorization.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has a history of executing on its buyback authorizations.

*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business could force the company to conserve cash and suspend the buyback program.
