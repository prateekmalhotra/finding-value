### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

No explicit, forward-looking quantitative guidance for revenue, margins, or capital expenditures was available in the reviewed Q2 2025 earnings call transcripts. Key qualitative commentary includes:

*   "Celsius plans to continue its international expansion and focus on new product launches." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 7, 2025).
*   "...we expect margin pressure associated with higher input costs..." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 7, 2025).

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

Given the lack of explicit guidance, the following assumptions are based on historical performance and management's qualitative commentary.

*   **Revenue Growth:** A 3-year historical revenue CAGR is not directly used due to the recent large acquisition of Alani Nu, which makes historical growth rates less representative. Instead, a declining growth rate is assumed, starting high and moderating as the company scales.
    *   **Year 1:** 30% (Reflecting continued strong momentum and acquisition synergies)
    *   **Year 2:** 25%
    *   **Year 3:** 20%
    *   **Year 4:** 15%
    *   **Year 5:** 10%
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 8.1%. Due to management's commentary on "margin pressure," the operating margin is conservatively held flat at 8.0% throughout the forecast period.
*   **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is approximately 30%. A 25% tax rate is used, assuming a normalization closer to the statutory rate over time.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex was 1.5% of revenue. This is assumed to continue.
    *   **D&A:** TTM D&A was 1.0% of revenue. This is assumed to continue.
    *   **SBC:** TTM SBC was 1.4% of revenue. This is assumed to continue.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** TTM Change in WC was 1.7% of revenue. This is assumed to continue as a percentage of *incremental* revenue.
*   **Share Count:** The latest diluted weighted-average shares of 243 million is used.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,166 | $2,707 | $3,249 | $3,736 | $4,110 |
| EBIT (8.0% margin) | $173 | $217 | $260 | $299 | $329 |
| Tax (25%) | ($43) | ($54) | ($65) | ($75) | ($82) |
| NOPAT | $130 | $163 | $195 | $224 | $247 |
| D&A (1.0% of Rev) | $22 | $27 | $32 | $37 | $41 |
| SBC (1.4% of Rev) | ($30) | ($38) | ($45) | ($52) | ($58) |
| Capex (1.5% of Rev) | ($32) | ($41) | ($49) | ($56) | ($62) |
| Change in WC (1.7% of Incr. Rev) | ($9) | ($9) | ($9) | ($8) | ($6) |
| **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** | **$81** | **$102** | **$124** | **$145** | **$162** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.3% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 0.88 (Seeking Alpha, 24M Beta). This reflects slightly lower volatility than the market, which is reasonable for a company with a strong brand and growth trajectory.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.3% + 0.88 \* 5.0% = 8.7%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Interest Expense / Total Debt = $18.1M / $871.9M = 2.1%**
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 2.1% \* (1 - 25%) = 1.6%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Cap:** $15.02B (at $61.84/share)
    *   **Total Debt:** $0.87B
    *   **WACC = (15.02 / 15.89) \* 8.7% + (0.87 / 15.89) \* 1.6% = 8.3%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Assumed long-run inflation rate).
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($162 \* 1.025) / (8.3% - 2.5%) = $2,862 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $329 + $41 = $370 million**
    *   A conservative 15x exit multiple is assumed, which is reasonable for a branded consumer packaged goods company with this level of growth.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $370 \* 15 = $5,550 million**
    *   Given the significant discrepancy, the lower Gordon Growth terminal value of **$2,862 million** will be used for the base case.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:**
    *   $81/(1.083)^1 + $102/(1.083)^2 + $124/(1.083)^3 + $145/(1.083)^4 + $162/(1.083)^5 = $75 + $87 + $97 + $105 + $108 = **$472 million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:**
    *   $2,862 / (1.083)^5 = **$1,918 million**
*   **Enterprise Value = $472 + $1,918 = $2,390 million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $871.9M - $615.2M = $256.7M
    *   **Equity Value = $2,390M - $256.7M = $2,133.3 million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **$2,133.3 million / 243 million shares = $8.78 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $8.78**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Slower revenue growth (e.g., starting at 20% and declining) and margin compression to 6% could result in a value closer to **$6.00 per share**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Faster revenue growth (e.g., starting at 40% and declining) and slight margin expansion to 10% could result in a value closer to **$15.00 per share**.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value.
    *   **MOS Price = $8.78 \* (1 - 0.30) = $6.15**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The energy drink market is intensely competitive, with larger players like Monster and Red Bull, and a constant influx of new entrants.
2.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation is highly sensitive to future growth assumptions. Any slowdown in execution, particularly in international expansion or integration of the Alani Nu brand, could significantly impact value.
3.  **Input Cost Volatility:** As noted by management, gross margins are susceptible to pressure from higher input costs, which could compress profitability.
4.  **Key Person Risk:** The company's success is tied to its current management and marketing teams.
5.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The functional and energy drink market is subject to changing health regulations and consumer preferences.

final answer is 8.78 $
