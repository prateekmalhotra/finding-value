This is a well-structured valuation attempt, but I've identified several areas for improvement, primarily in the consistency of your projections and the calculation of Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF).

Here's a breakdown of the issues and the corrected valuation:

**Issues Identified:**

1.  **Inconsistent Revenue Projections (Part 2, Section D):** Your stated revenue growth tapering from 8.0% in Year 1 to 4.0% in Year 5 (implying 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%) does not align with the revenue figures provided in your FCFF table. The revenue numbers in your table are lower than what the stated growth rates would produce.
2.  **Handling of D&A and SBC Projections (Part 2, Section D):** While you explicitly state Capex and Change in Working Capital as percentages of revenue, D&A and Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) are given as TTM absolute figures. For a growing company, assuming these remain constant in absolute terms is generally less realistic than scaling them with a relevant driver, such as revenue, especially when other cost components are scaled. To maintain consistency and realism, I will project D&A and SBC as percentages of revenue, derived from their TTM relationship to TTM revenue.
    *   TTM D&A as % of Revenue = $2,656M / $25,972M = 10.23%
    *   TTM SBC as % of Revenue = $77M / $25,972M = 0.30%
3.  **Subsequent Calculation Errors:** Due to the issues above, the FCFF figures, Terminal Value, Present Value calculations, and ultimately the Enterprise and Equity Values, were all impacted and need to be recalculated.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

**A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $29.27 (at close, August 21, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM):**

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $25,972 | Sum of Q2 2024, Q3 2024, Q4 2024, and Q1 2025 revenues. |

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of $29.27, the market is pricing in the following assumptions:

*   **5-Year Revenue Growth Rate (CAGR):** Approximately **8.5%**
*   **Operating Margin:** Expanding from the current TTM of 16.0% to **18.0%** over the next five years.

**This implies the market believes Carnival will not only continue its strong recovery but also achieve higher profitability than its current TTM performance.**

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

**C) Formulate Conservative Assumptions (5 Years)**

My assumptions are more conservative, grounded in historical performance and a cautious outlook.

6.  **Revenue Growth:** The market's implied 8.5% CAGR is aggressive. I will use a more conservative **5-year CAGR of 6.0%**, tapering from 8.0% in Year 1, 7.0% in Year 2, 6.0% in Year 3, 5.0% in Year 4, to 4.0% in Year 5. This is supported by the potential for continued demand but also acknowledges the risks of economic slowdowns and geopolitical events.
7.  **Margin Path:** I will hold the **operating margin stable at the TTM level of 16.0%**. While management may target expansion, there is no clear evidence of specific initiatives that would guarantee margin improvement.
8.  **Taxes:** A **20% effective tax rate**, based on the historical average and statutory rates in the jurisdictions where Carnival operates.
9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** **10% of revenue**, in line with the historical average.
    *   **Working Capital:** **-1.5% of revenue**, consistent with the TTM figure.
    *   **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A):** Projected as **10.23% of revenue** (based on TTM D&A / TTM Revenue = $2,656M / $25,972M).
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** Projected as **0.30% of revenue** (based on TTM SBC / TTM Revenue = $77M / $25,972M).
10. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Treated as a real cash expense and subtracted from FCFF, scaled as above.
    *   **Share Count:** A net **1.0% annual increase** in diluted shares outstanding, reflecting dilution from stock-based compensation.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| Year | Growth Rate | Revenue (M) | EBIT (M) | FCFF (M) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0 (TTM)** | - | $25,972 | $4,155 | - |
| 1 | 8.0% | $28,049.76 | $4,487.96 | $3,981.65 |
| 2 | 7.0% | $30,013.24 | $4,802.12 | $4,300.47 |
| 3 | 6.0% | $31,814.03 | $5,090.24 | $4,635.76 |
| 4 | 5.0% | $33,404.73 | $5,344.76 | $4,980.26 |
| 5 | 4.0% | $34,741.12 | $5,558.58 | $5,294.51 |

I am using FCFF for valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
*(Detailed FCFF calculation breakdown for Year 1 for clarity: EBIT = $28,049.76 * 0.16 = $4,487.96. FCFF = $4,487.96 * (1 - 0.20) + ($28,049.76 * 0.1023) - ($28,049.76 * 0.0030) - ($28,049.76 * 0.10) - ($28,049.76 * -0.015) = $3,590.37 + $2,868.56 - $82.97 - $2,804.98 + $420.75 = $3,991.65. Slight rounding differences will occur in final table values)*

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

11. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.25%** (10-Year Treasury Yield, August 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%**
    *   Beta: **2.71** (StockAnalysis.com)
    *   Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 2.71 \* 5.0% = **17.8%**
12. **Cost of Debt:** **5.7%** (Interest Expense / Total Debt)
13. **WACC:** (0.60 \* 17.8%) + (0.40 \* 5.7% \* (1 - 0.20)) = **12.5%**
    *(Debt and Equity weights of 40% and 60% are reasonable given the market values of debt and equity based on current market price)*

**F) Terminal Value**

14. **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%** (long-term inflation expectation)
    *   Terminal Value = ($5,294.51 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.125 - 0.025) = **$54,268.7 million**
15. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = $5,558.58 (EBIT) + ($34,741.12 * 0.1023) (D&A) = $5,558.58 + $3,553.48 = $9,112.06 million
    *   Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple = $54,268.7 / $9,112.06 = **5.96x**
    *   The implied multiple is still lower than the historical median of around 10x, but it is a reasonable cross-check for a company with high financial leverage and WACC, and the Gordon Growth terminal value will be used as the primary method.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

16. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of FCFF (Discrete period) =
        $3,981.65 / (1.125)^1 = $3,539.24
        $4,300.47 / (1.125)^2 = $3,391.26
        $4,635.76 / (1.125)^3 = $3,248.81
        $4,980.26 / (1.125)^4 = $3,109.84
        $5,294.51 / (1.125)^5 = $2,936.78
        **Total PV of FCFF = $16,225.93 million**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $54,268.7 / (1.125)^5 = **$30,115.35 million**
    *   Enterprise Value = $16,225.93 + $30,115.35 = **$46,341.28 million**
17. **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = $46,341.28 (Enterprise Value) - $27,018 (Total Debt) + $833 (Cash) = **$20,156.28 million**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

18. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Year 5 Diluted Shares = 1,424 \* (1.01)^5 = **1,496.04 million**
    *   Fair Value per Share = $20,156.28 / 1,496.04 = **$13.47**
19. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$13.47**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** (Approximate, based on original assumption ranges) A more conservative scenario could fall around **$8.00 - $10.00**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** (Approximate, based on original assumption ranges) A more optimistic scenario could approach **$18.00 - $22.00**.
20. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety on the base-case estimate results in a MOS price of $13.47 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$9.43**

**Risk Notes**

*   **Geopolitical and Economic Risks:** The cruise industry is highly sensitive to geopolitical events, economic downturns, and changes in consumer discretionary spending.
*   **Fuel Price Volatility:** Fuel is a significant operating expense, and price fluctuations can materially impact profitability.
*   **Regulatory and Environmental Risks:** The company faces increasing regulatory scrutiny related to environmental practices, which could lead to higher costs.
*   **Competition:** The cruise industry is competitive, with pressure on pricing and occupancy levels.
*   **Debt Load:** Carnival has a significant amount of debt, which increases financial risk.

final answer is $13.47
