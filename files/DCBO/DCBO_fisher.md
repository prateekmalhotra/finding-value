The company's platform addresses numerous use cases, including employee onboarding, compliance training, sales enablement, and customer and partner training. For the fiscal year 2024, subscription revenue grew by 20% to $204.3 million, and has continued to grow 15% in Q2 2025, indicating sustained demand. Management continues to see strength in the mid-market and enterprise segments, with ongoing expansions within existing large customers.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Docebo has a stated focus on innovation, particularly with its AI-powered learning platform. The company has recently focused on its Harmony AI platform to enhance its offerings. In November 2024, Docebo announced a strategic alliance with Deloitte to guide companies in transforming their learning systems. The company also expanded its partnership with AWS, making its solutions available on the AWS Marketplace in October 2024, creating a new sales channel.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Docebo's total revenue was $216.9 million. The company's consistent product innovation, including its AI-driven platform, suggests its R&D is effective in creating competitive products that drive sales. Revenue growth of 14% in the most recent quarter (Q2 2025) points to successful translation of R&D into market adoption. However, specific R&D output metrics like patents or feature velocity are not consistently disclosed, making a precise peer comparison difficult.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Docebo has demonstrated strong performance in growing its customer base, particularly in the mid-market and enterprise segments. In Q2 2025, the company reported strong performance in mid-market for both new logos and expansions. The percentage of customers with over $100k in spending increased from 16% to 23% in the past year, indicating success in landing larger deals and expanding existing accounts. The company sells its products in approximately 70 countries to nearly 3,900 companies as of the end of fiscal 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Docebo exhibits strong gross margins characteristic of a SaaS business. For Q2 2025, gross profit margin was 80.9%, a slight improvement from 80.7% in the prior year. For the full year 2024, the gross margin was 81.0%. The company has also achieved profitability, reporting net income of $3.1 million in Q2 2025 and $26.7 million for the full year 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Docebo's gross margins have remained consistently high and stable, around 81%. Management has highlighted a focus on efficient allocation of spending and targeting verticals where they have more success, which implies a focus on profitable growth. The move upmarket to larger enterprise customers, who typically have higher contract values, also provides an avenue for margin improvement through economies of scale in support and service.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no mentions of significant labor disputes, strikes, or widespread negative publicity regarding employee relations in recent financial filings or earnings calls. Docebo was named to Newsweek’s 2025 Global Most Loved Workplaces list. The company had over 900 employees at the end of fiscal 2024. While this is a positive indicator, detailed metrics like employee turnover are not disclosed, preventing a deeper analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250730596372/en/Docebo-Announces-Participation-in-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-August-September](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250730596372/en/Docebo-Announces-Participation-in-Upcoming-Investor-Conferences-in-August-September) (July 30, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816229/000165495425002010/dcb_ex99-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816229/000165495425002010/dcb_ex99-1.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Docebo has experienced recent changes in key executive positions. Alessio Artuffo was appointed CEO in September 2024, succeeding the founder. More recently, the CFO, Sukaran Mehta, stepped down effective February 28, 2025, with a search for a successor underway. While leadership transitions are not uncommon, a change in both CEO and CFO within a short period introduces uncertainty and prevents a clear "Yes" based on a track record of stability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816229/000165495425002010/dcb_ex99-1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816229/000165495425002010/dcb_ex99-1.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the CEO, Alessio Artuffo, who also serves as President, the company's investor-facing team includes Brandon Farber as the current CFO and a VP of Investor Relations. The 2024 Annual Information Form lists other key executives. However, the recent departure of the CFO and the ongoing search for a replacement highlight a potential gap in the C-suite, making it difficult to confirm sufficient management depth at this exact moment.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The auditor's report also stated that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting. There is no recent history of restatements or disclosed material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816229/000181622925000004/docebo-20241231_d2.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1816229/000181622925000004/docebo-20241231_d2.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Docebo's emphasis on using AI across its platform is a key differentiator in the learning management system (LMS) industry. This allows for personalized and automated learning experiences, which can create a stickier platform and drive better outcomes for customers. The platform's flexibility to handle both internal (employee) and external (customer, partner) training use cases on a single instance is another significant competitive advantage, allowing it to consolidate a larger portion of a client's learning technology budget.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary consistently emphasizes capturing the large market opportunity and driving "durable, long-term growth." While the company is now profitable, its revised full-year 2025 guidance projects total revenue growth between 10.0% to 11.0% with an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 17.0% to 18.0%. This indicates a balanced approach, where investments in growth are still prioritized, but within a framework of increasing profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Docebo has a strong balance sheet and is generating positive cash flow. The company generated $11.4 million in free cash flow in Q2 2025. Further, the company has an active Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB), or share repurchase program, which commenced on May 20, 2024, and allows for the repurchase of its own shares, signaling confidence in its financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed prepared remarks and hosts a Q&A session during quarterly earnings calls. In the Q2 2025 call, executives addressed questions regarding segment performance and deal elongation in the enterprise segment, acknowledging some challenges while highlighting areas of strength. The company also provides and revises annual guidance, offering a degree of transparency into its expectations. There is no evidence of a lack of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's 2024 40-F filing reveals no material legal proceedings, related-party transactions that would suggest conflicts of interest, or regulatory actions against the company or its executives. The audit committee consists of independent directors, and the company has a standard code of business conduct and ethics. The clean auditor opinion on internal controls further supports a conclusion of sound governance and integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Docebo scores well on the majority of Fisher's points, demonstrating strong fundamentals in its product-market fit, sales execution, and financial health. Its key strengths are a long runway for growth in the corporate learning market, a competitive product differentiated by AI, high and stable gross margins, and a solid balance sheet with no need for dilutive financing. The primary weaknesses identified relate to recent management instability, specifically the change in both the CEO and CFO roles within a relatively short period. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on two factors: 1) The successful appointment of a new permanent CFO and a period of stability within the executive team, which would flip the "No" answers on executive relations and management depth to "Yes". 2) Sustained execution on its growth strategy, particularly demonstrating that its AI-led product development can continue to capture market share and drive the double-digit revenue growth projected in its guidance.

fisher score is 13 / 15
