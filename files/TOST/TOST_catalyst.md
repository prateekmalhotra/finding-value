### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Share Repurchase Program:**
*   If Toast repurchases $163 million of stock at an average price of $45 per share, this would reduce the share count by approximately 3.6 million shares. This would increase EPS and could lead to a 2-5% increase in the stock price, all else being equal.

**2. International Expansion:**
*   If Toast can generate 10% of its revenue from international markets in five years, this could add over $500 million in annual revenue, based on current revenue levels. This could have a significant impact on the company's valuation, potentially leading to a 10-20% increase in the stock price.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Toast are generally positive, with the share repurchase program and increased product adoption providing a tailwind for the stock. However, the impact of these catalysts is likely to be small to medium in the near term. The long-term catalyst of international expansion is more significant, but it will take time to play out. Overall, the net catalyst balance is positive, but the short-term market signal is neutral to slightly positive.
