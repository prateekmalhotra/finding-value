### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Merger Synergy Realization**
*   **Formula:** Change in Equity Value = (Annual Synergies * (1 - Tax Rate)) / WACC
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Annual Synergies (Base Case): $120 million
    *   Tax Rate: 21%
    *   WACC: 8%
*   **Calculation:** ($120M * (1 - 0.21)) / 0.08 = $1.185 billion
*   **Impact:** This represents a potential increase of over 25% to the company's current market capitalization.

**2. International Expansion**
*   **Formula:** Change in Equity Value = (Annual Revenue * Net Margin) / WACC
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Annual Revenue (Base Case): $25 million
    *   Net Margin: 50% (due to high-margin licensing fees)
    *   WACC: 10% (higher discount rate for international project)
*   **Calculation:** ($25M * 0.50) / 0.10 = $125 million
*   **Impact:** This represents a potential 3% increase to the company's market capitalization from this single project.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Six Flags Entertainment Corporation are predominantly positive. The successful execution of the merger with Cedar Fair and the realization of the projected synergies represent the most significant near-term driver of shareholder value. The "Project Accelerate" initiative provides a clear roadmap for organic growth and margin improvement. The recent insider buying, while a smaller catalyst, adds to the positive sentiment.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failed Merger Integration:** An inability to successfully integrate the operations and cultures of Six Flags and Cedar Fair could lead to a failure to realize synergies, and could even be value-destructive.
2.  **Severe Economic Downturn:** A significant recession would reduce discretionary consumer spending, leading to lower attendance and in-park spending, which would negatively impact revenues and profitability.
3.  **Catastrophic Park Incident:** A major accident at one of the company's parks could result in significant legal liabilities, reputational damage, and a decline in attendance.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on the analysis of the available evidence, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation presents a compelling investment opportunity with a favorable risk/reward profile. The successful realization of merger synergies with Cedar Fair is the most significant near-term catalyst, with the potential to drive the share price materially higher. The "Project Accelerate" initiative and international expansion provide additional avenues for growth. Investors should monitor the company's quarterly earnings reports for progress on synergy realization and the execution of its strategic plan.
