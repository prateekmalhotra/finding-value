### 1) Network Effects (weight 18%)
**Reasoning:** Roku exhibits strong same-side and cross-side network effects. A large and growing user base attracts content publishers who want to reach this audience, and the vast content library, in turn, makes the platform more attractive to new users. This virtuous cycle is evidenced by Roku's market leadership in hours streamed and its ability to attract a massive library of content.
**Evidence:**
*   Roku is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States, Canada, and Mexico by hours streamed. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   The company grew to 89.8 million Streaming Households by the end of 2024, a 12% increase from 80.0 million in 2023. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   In the first quarter of 2025, users streamed 35.8 billion hours, an increase of 16% from the 30.8 billion hours in the same period of 2024.
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for Roku users are present but not formidable. The primary lock-in is behavioral; users become accustomed to the Roku OS, their curated content and app layout, and the convenience of integrated billing through Roku Pay. However, these are overcome with moderate effort, and the low cost of competing hardware from giants like Amazon and Google keeps the barrier to switching relatively low.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model relies on selling hardware at low margins to build an installed base, implying that the hardware itself is not a significant barrier to exit. The Devices segment consistently runs at a negative gross margin, posting a loss of USD 80.3 million in 2024. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   There are no contractual lock-ins for users, who can switch platforms by purchasing a new device for a relatively low price.
*   The Roku Channel's Premium Subscriptions feature centralizes billing, creating a layer of convenience that adds a minor switching cost. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** Roku does not possess a traditional cost advantage; rather, it strategically subsidizes its hardware to drive platform adoption. The Devices segment consistently operates at a negative gross margin, a deliberate choice to expand the user base for its profitable Platform segment. While this makes its hardware inexpensive for consumers, it's a strategic cost, not a structural advantage over peers.
**Evidence:**
*   The Devices segment recorded a gross loss of USD 80.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, and a gross loss of USD 19.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025.
*   The company states it expects to "continue to manage the average selling prices of Roku streaming devices in an effort to sell more devices... this trade off from devices gross profit or loss... should result in increased platform revenue." (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   Manufacturing is fully outsourced, preventing a proprietary low-cost production process. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP (weight 12%)
**Reasoning:** Roku has strong brand recognition in the TV streaming space, which it has built over a decade as a pioneer in the industry. Its primary intangible asset is its proprietary Roku OS, which is valued by users for its simplicity. While the company holds numerous patents, their carrying value is not substantial, and the brand faces intense competition from some of the world's largest technology companies.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company had approximately 1,500 issued patents and 600 pending applications. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   The net carrying amount of the company's patents was USD 2.5 million as of March 31, 2025.
*   Competitors like Amazon, Apple, and Google have "greater financial resources" and can "subsidize the cost of their streaming devices... which could make it harder for us" to compete. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** Roku has secured a powerful distribution network through deep relationships with major retailers and its Roku TV licensing program. Licensing its OS to TV manufacturers allows it to achieve massive scale and footprint in households with minimal capital expenditure. This established retail and OEM network creates a significant barrier for new entrants to replicate.
**Evidence:**
*   A few retailers account for the majority of device sales: "Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target collectively accounted for 81% of our devices revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024." (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   The Roku TV licensing program, where TV OEMs license the Roku OS and smart TV reference designs, has been a key driver of Streaming Household growth. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** Roku collects significant first-party data on user search, content selection, and viewing habits directly from its platform. This data creates a feedback loop, improving content recommendations for users and enabling targeted ad campaigns for advertisers. However, this advantage is limited by the fact that Roku cannot fully access viewing data within many of its most popular third-party apps, like Netflix.
**Evidence:**
*   Roku's "direct relationship with customers provides us with insights about their behavior on our streaming platform, including certain content viewers search for, the apps viewers install and watch." (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   A key risk factor notes, "we are not able to fully utilize program level viewing data from many of our most popular apps to improve the relevancy of advertisements." (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   The company recently added a new personalized content row to the Home Screen powered by AI that uses this data to recommend content from across the platform. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects (weight 8%)
**Reasoning:** Roku has a strong platform and ecosystem, which is highly related to its network effects. The platform's large scale attracts a vast number of third-party developers, creating a rich content library that enhances the platform's value for users. The Roku OS and developer tools make it relatively easy for content partners to build and monetize their services.
**Evidence:**
*   The Roku platform provides access to thousands of streaming apps from a wide range of content partners. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
*   Management's strategy is to grow advertising demand through "deeper third-party platform integrations," highlighting the importance of the developer ecosystem. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 1, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers (weight 6%)
**Reasoning:** Roku does not benefit from any significant regulatory or legal barriers that protect it from competition. The company's filings describe regulations related to privacy, trade, and intellectual property primarily as risks and compliance costs rather than protective moats. The industry is open to competition, and Roku does not hold exclusive licenses or government mandates that would deter rivals.
**Evidence:**
*   The "Risk Factors" section of the 10-K lists numerous regulations as potential threats, including those related to data privacy, content liability, and net neutrality, with no mention of regulations that provide a competitive advantage. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity (weight 4%)
**Reasoning:** Roku operates a capital-light business model, particularly for its hardware segment, by outsourcing all manufacturing. This strategy lowers the barrier to entry and is the opposite of a moat built on high capital intensity. The company's primary investments are in R&D and content, which are not sunk, specific assets that a competitor would find difficult to replicate.
**Evidence:**
*   "We do not have any internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on a limited number of contract manufacturers to build our players, smart home products, and Roku-branded TVs." (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility (weight 2%)
**Reasoning:** Roku has moderate revenue visibility from its Platform segment. While advertising revenue can be cyclical, a portion is secured through upfront commitments. The growing subscription revenue via Roku Pay adds a recurring and predictable element. The company's disclosure of remaining performance obligations provides a degree of forward visibility.
**Evidence:**
*   Remaining performance obligations for contracted revenue not yet recognized stood at USD 811.1 million as of March 31, 2025, with 76% expected to be recognized within the next 12 months.
*   Management highlighted the growth of subscriptions as a key strategic priority, which enhances revenue diversification and predictability. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 1, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (4 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 0.72 + 0.30 + 0.15 + 0.36 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.32 + 0.06 + 0.04 + 0.06 = 2.71.
**Numeric Weighted Score: 27.1 / 100** (This score appears low due to the strict scoring criteria. Re-evaluating based on the provided thresholds. Wait, the final score should be a sum of weighted contributions, which is 7.2+3.0+1.5+3.6+4.0+3.0+3.2+0.6+0.4+0.6 = 27.1. This is not out of 100. It seems the provided example was wrong, the sum of weights is 100%, so the score should be out of 5*100=500 and then scaled? Let me re-read the scoring. "Compute a weighted score = sum(score_dim * weight_dim)." "Convert weighted score (0-100) to a 0-5 moat rating". Let's assume the weight percentage is a whole number. 18% = 18. So 4 * 18 = 72. No, that cannot be it. Let me re-calculate: 4 * 0.18 = 0.72. The sum is 2.71. This would be out of a maximum of 5. Let me redo the calculation based on the weights adding to 100. (4 * 18) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 15) + (3 * 12) + (4 * 10) + (3 * 10) + (4 * 8) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (3 * 2) = 72 + 30 + 15 + 36 + 40 + 30 + 32 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 271. This must be the weighted score. No, 271 is not possible. Okay, let's go with the initial calculation of 27.1)

Let's re-calculate:
(4 * 18) + (2 * 15) + (1 * 15) + (3 * 12) + (4 * 10) + (3 * 10) + (4 * 8) + (1 * 6) + (1 * 4) + (3 * 2) = 72 + 30 + 15 + 36 + 40 + 30 + 32 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 271. Okay, this seems very high. Let's assume my first calculation was correct. 27.1. Let's see the threshold. `10 <= Weighted < 30 → moat rating = 1`. This seems too low.

Let me re-read the instruction carefully. "Compute a weighted score = sum(score_dim * weight_dim). Weights above are the default... Convert weighted score (0–100) to a 0–5 moat rating". Okay, so the score should be between 0-100. Let's multiply my 2.71 score by 20 to scale it to 100. 2.71*20=54.2. That seems right.
**Weighted score = 54.2 / 100**

### Mapping
A weighted score of 54.2 falls into the range of 50 ≤ Weighted < 70.
**Final Moat Rating:** 3 / 5

### Moat Duration Justification
The moat is primarily derived from network effects and distribution scale, which are reasonably durable but face immense competitive pressure from vertically integrated giants (Google, Amazon). The company's key agreements with content partners and retailers are typically 1-3 years in term, requiring constant renegotiation. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025) Given the rapid evolution of the streaming market and the lack of strong, long-term contractual lock-ins or patent protection, the competitive advantage is unlikely to persist beyond a medium-term horizon. An estimated duration of 5-8 years is appropriate.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **OEMs Abandon Roku OS:** Major TV manufacturers like TCL or Hisense could choose to develop their own operating systems or partner exclusively with Google's Android TV or Amazon's Fire OS, rapidly eroding Roku's user base growth and scale. (Roku 10-K, Risk Factors, Feb 14, 2025)
2.  **Loss of Key Content:** If Roku fails to renew distribution agreements with one or more of its top 3 content partners (which account for nearly half of streaming hours), the user experience would be severely degraded, causing users to switch to other platforms where that content is available. (Roku 10-K, Feb 14, 2025)
3.  **Data Privacy Regulations:** New, stricter data privacy laws could limit Roku's ability to collect user data, which is crucial for targeted advertising and content personalization, thereby weakening its data advantage and Platform segment monetization. (Roku 10-K, Risk Factors, Feb 14, 2025)

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Streaming Households Growth Rate (YoY):** A slowdown below industry growth indicates market share loss and weakening network effects.
*   **Streaming Hours per Household:** A decline suggests weakening user engagement.
*   **Platform Segment Gross Margin %:** Compression would signal increased competition or a deteriorating negotiating position with content partners.
*   **Devices Segment Gross Margin:** While expected to be negative, a significantly worsening margin could indicate unsustainable pricing pressure.
*   **Ad Revenue Growth vs. OTT Market:** Management claims to be outpacing the market; falling behind would be a red flag. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 1, 2025)
*   **Revenue from new monetization efforts (e.g., Subscriptions):** Stagnation would show a failure to diversify from advertising.
*   **Concentration of Streaming Hours:** An increase in the percentage of hours from the top 3 apps would indicate a higher risk from key partner dependency.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Roku's current moat rating of 3 is justified by its strong network effects and impressive distribution scale, which have made it a central hub in the streaming ecosystem. The company has successfully built a large, engaged user base that attracts content partners and advertisers, creating a virtuous cycle. However, this moat is narrow and faces significant, persistent threats. The lack of meaningful switching costs, a strategy of losing money on hardware, and dependence on a few key retail and content partners make its position precarious. The rating would be upgraded if Roku can demonstrate a durable data advantage that translates into superior monetization and profitability, or if it can create higher switching costs through its platform services. Conversely, the rating would be downgraded if major TV partners abandon its OS or if it loses a key content application, which would unravel its network effects.

moat rating is 3 / 5
