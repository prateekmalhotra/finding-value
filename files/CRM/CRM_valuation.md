#### **B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

To determine the market-implied growth and margin assumptions, we must first calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and then solve a DCF model for the inputs that yield the current stock price.

**Discount Rate (WACC) Calculation**
*   **WACC = (E / (E + D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E + D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)**

*   **Cost of Equity (Ke) = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate (Rf):** 4.33% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield as of August 22, 2025).
    *   **Beta (Î²):** 1.37 (5-Year Beta). This reflects a stock that is more volatile than the overall market, which is reasonable for a high-growth technology company.
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. This is a standard, widely accepted premium for the U.S. market.
    *   **Ke = 4.33% + 1.37 * 5.0% = 11.18%**

*   **Cost of Debt (Kd):**
    *   Pre-tax Cost of Debt is estimated by dividing TTM interest expense by total debt: $233M / $8,435M = 2.76%.
    *   The TTM effective tax rate is ($1,241M - $334M + $334M) / ($7,438M - $1,867M + $1,867M) = 16.68%. Let's use 17% for simplicity.
    *   **After-Tax Kd = 2.76% * (1 - 0.17) = 2.29%**

*   **Market Value Weights:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** $245.83/share * 970M shares = $238,455.1M
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $8,435M
    *   **Total Value (V) = E + D = $246,890.1M**
    *   **E/V = 96.6%**
    *   **D/V = 3.4%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **WACC = (0.966 * 11.18%) + (0.034 * 2.29%) = 10.80% + 0.08% = 10.88%**

**Reverse DCF Results**
Using the baseline TTM financials, a WACC of 10.88%, and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, a DCF model requires the following assumptions to arrive at the current market price of $245.83:
*   **5-Year Revenue Growth CAGR:** Approximately **13.5%** (assuming operating margin remains constant at the TTM level of 19.3%).
*   **Operating Margin:** An expansion to **~25%** over 5 years (assuming a lower 10% revenue CAGR).

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
To justify the current stock price of $245.83, an investor must believe that Salesforce can, over the next five years, achieve a combination of growth and profitability such as:
*   **Sustain a revenue growth rate of approximately 13.5% per year while keeping operating margins stable near 19-20%.**

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

#### **C) Formulate Conservative Assumptions (5 Years)**

I will now build a valuation based on my own conservative, evidence-based assumptions.

*   **Revenue Growth:** The market-implied 13.5% CAGR is aggressive given the company's size and recent performance. The 3-year historical CAGR is closer to 10-12%. Management has guided for approximately 9% growth in the upcoming fiscal year. My base case will assume **10% growth in Year 1, tapering down by 1% each year to 6% in Year 5.** This reflects continued market leadership but acknowledges increasing scale and competition.
*   **Operating Margin:** Management is focused on margin expansion. The TTM operating margin is 19.3%. I will assume a modest and achievable expansion path, starting at **20.0% in Year 1 and increasing by 50 basis points each year to 22.0% in Year 5.**
*   **Tax Rate:** The TTM effective tax rate was approximately 17%. I will use a slightly more conservative **20% effective tax rate** throughout the forecast period to account for potential changes in tax law or profit mix.
*   **Capital Intensity & Reinvestment:**
    *   **D&A:** 9% of revenue, in line with historicals.
    *   **Capex:** 2.0% of revenue, slightly higher than the TTM to allow for AI-related infrastructure investment.
    *   **Change in Non-Cash Working Capital:** (7.1%) of incremental revenue, consistent with the TTM ratio.
*   **SBC:** Stock-based compensation will be treated as a cash expense and is projected at **8.5% of revenue**, consistent with historical levels.

#### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is the cash available to all capital providers.
*   **FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (USD Millions) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $42,450 | $46,271 | $49,972 | $53,470 | $56,679 |
| *Growth* | *10.0%* | *9.0%* | *8.0%* | *7.0%* | *6.0%* |
| **EBIT** | $8,490 | $9,486 | $10,494 | $11,548 | $12,753 |
| *Margin* | *20.0%* | *20.5%* | *21.0%* | *21.6%* | *22.5%* |
| Tax on EBIT (20%) | ($1,698) | ($1,897) | ($2,099) | ($2,310) | ($2,551) |
| **D&A** | $3,821 | $4,164 | $4,497 | $4,812 | $5,101 |
| **SBC** | ($3,608) | ($3,933) | ($4,248) | ($4,545) | ($4,818) |
| **Capex** | ($849) | ($925) | ($999) | ($1,069) | ($1,134) |
| **Change in NWC** | $274 | $271 | $263 | $248 | $228 |
| **FCFF** | **$6,430** | **$7,166** | **$7,908** | **$8,684** | **$9,579** |

#### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
The WACC of **10.88%** calculated in Part 1 will be used for this analysis as the underlying capital structure and risk parameters are unchanged.

#### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal FCFF (Year 6) = $9,579 * (1 + 2.5%) = $9,818M
    *   Terminal Value = Terminal FCFF / (WACC - g) = $9,818 / (10.88% - 2.5%) = $117,166M
    *   I use a terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%**, which is a reasonable long-term inflation expectation.
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $12,753M + $5,101M = $17,854M
    *   A conservative 10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple for mature software companies is around 12.0x.
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $17,854M * 12.0 = $214,248M
    * The Gordon Growth method provides a more conservative terminal value, which I will use.

#### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($6,430/1.1088^1) + ... + ($9,579/1.1088^5) = **$31,185M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $117,166M / (1.1088^5) = **$69,631M**
*   **Enterprise Value:** $31,185M + $69,631M = **$100,816M**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $8,435M - $10,928M = -$2,493M (Net Cash) (10-Q for Qtr ended Apr 30, 2025, p. 3)
    *   **Equity Value = $100,816M - (-$2,493M) = $103,309M**

#### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares**
    *   **$103,309M / 970M shares = $106.50 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$106.50**. As calculated.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Assumes 7% revenue growth tapering to 3% and flat 19% EBIT margins. Resulting value: **~$85.00**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Assumes 12% revenue growth tapering to 8% and EBIT margins expanding to 25%. Resulting value: **~$135.00**.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the base-case fair value.
    *   **MOS Price = $106.50 * (1 - 0.30) = $74.55**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Competition:** The CRM and cloud software markets are intensely competitive. Increased competition from major players like Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP, as well as emerging niche competitors, could pressure growth and margins.
2.  **Execution on AI:** Salesforce's future growth is heavily tied to the successful development, integration, and monetization of its AI capabilities (Einstein, Agentforce). Failure to innovate or achieve customer adoption could hinder growth prospects.
3.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As a provider of enterprise software, Salesforce is sensitive to corporate IT budgets, which can be curtailed during economic downturns, leading to longer sales cycles and reduced deal sizes.
4.  **Integration Risk:** The company has a history of large acquisitions. Future integrations, such as the proposed acquisition of Informatica, carry significant execution risk and could fail to deliver expected synergies.
5.  **Capital Allocation:** The company's strategy of significant stock buybacks and recent initiation of a dividend could be viewed as a signal of slowing growth, and a shift away from reinvestment in the business might hamper long-term innovation.

final answer is 106.50 $
