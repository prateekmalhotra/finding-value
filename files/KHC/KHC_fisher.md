**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is focused on its "Accelerate Platforms" (Taste Elevation, Easy Meals, Substantial Snacking) which are in attractive markets. Kraft Heinz is also targeting growth in emerging markets, which currently represent a small fraction of sales, and the "Away From Home" foodservice channel, which historically outpaces retail growth. The company is adapting products to local tastes in regions like Latin America and Asia to capitalize on the growing demand for packaged foods. However, the company faces headwinds in its mature North American market, with declining sales volumes being a concern.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a stated goal to deliver $2 billion in incremental net sales from innovation. The company is renovating its core brands with new flavors and packaging, such as new spicy ketchup flavors and more sustainable packaging. They are also leveraging partnerships with companies like Taco Bell and NotCo to innovate. CEO Carlos Abrams-Rivera has emphasized a strategy of renovating the core portfolio while also introducing "truly disruptive" innovations to the market, such as the 360Crisp platform.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 10-K, Kraft Heinz reported R&D expenses of $150 million on net sales of $25.8 billion, which is less than 0.6% of sales. This is low for the consumer packaged goods industry. However, the company is increasing its investment, with a stated 15% year-over-year increase in R&D investment announced in February 2024. The company is targeting $2 billion in incremental net sales from innovation by 2027 and has seen its percentage of sales from innovation grow from 1.6% in 2022 to ~3% by the end of 2024.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kraft Heinz possesses an extensive distribution network, selling products through its own sales organization as well as independent brokers and distributors to a wide range of retail and foodservice channels globally. The company is strengthening its sales excellence by enhancing strategic customer partnerships and leveraging digital tools to improve efficiency. However, the company's reliance on a few key customers is a risk; in 2024, its top five customers in North America accounted for approximately 46% of the segment's net sales, with Walmart alone representing 21% of consolidated net sales.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, Kraft Heinz reported a gross profit margin of 34.7% and an operating margin of 6.5% (heavily impacted by non-cash impairment losses). Its adjusted operating margin was 20.7%. Historically, the company's operating margins in the low 20s have been materially above the mid-to-high teens of its peers. The gross margin has shown improvement, increasing from 31.1% in 2022 to 34.7% in 2024.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kraft Heinz is actively pursuing cost efficiencies, targeting $2.5 billion in gross efficiencies by 2027. This is part of its AGILE@SCALE strategy, which involves partnering with technology firms to enhance productivity and operational efficiency through digital transformation and automation. Since 2023, the company has already generated $1.1 billion in gross efficiencies. The company has also employed strategic pricing to offset inflationary pressures, which has supported margin improvement.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kraft Heinz has received "Great Place to Work" certification in 16 countries, based on employee satisfaction surveys. The company emphasizes a culture of listening, utilizing various feedback channels to translate employee input into action. In its 2024 10-K, the company reports a global Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.39 in 2024, an improvement from 0.53 in 2023, indicating a focus on employee safety.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team has seen some changes, with Carlos Abrams-Rivera taking over as CEO in December 2023. However, key leaders like the CFO, Andre Maciel, have been with the company for a significant time, providing continuity. The current executive team listed in the 2024 10-K appears stable. There is no public evidence of significant strife or discord among the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K lists a diversified team of executive officers with extensive experience in the food and beverage and CPG industries at companies like Campbell Soup, Mars, and Anheuser-Busch InBev. Key roles beyond the CEO are clearly defined, including a Global Chief Growth Officer, Global Chief Procurement and Sustainability Officer, and President of North America, suggesting a deep bench of leadership across critical functions.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 10-K, management concluded that as of December 28, 2024, the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. There were no material weaknesses identified.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm) (February 13, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kraft Heinz's key competitive advantage lies in its portfolio of iconic brands, including eight brands with over $1 billion in annual sales. This strong brand recognition provides a significant competitive moat. The company also possesses a vast global distribution network, which allows it to reach a wide customer base efficiently and represents a significant scale advantage.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has articulated a long-term strategy focused on sustainable growth. The company is increasing investments in marketing (targeting 4.8% of net sales by the end of 2025) and R&D to support brand growth, even while facing near-term volume pressures. The efficiency programs aiming for $2.5 billion in savings by 2027 are designed to free up resources for reinvestment rather than solely to boost short-term profits. This indicates a willingness to invest now for future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generated $4.2 billion in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2024. As of December 28, 2024, the company has $1.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and access to a $4.0 billion revolving credit facility. The company is also executing a $3.0 billion share repurchase program, indicating it has sufficient capital and is focused on returning value to shareholders, not dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of earnings call transcripts, such as the Q2 2025 call, shows management addressing challenges directly. They acknowledged volume declines and losing share due to promotions by competitors, but also laid out their strategy for investing in marketing and innovation to address these issues. Management also reiterated its full-year guidance, providing transparency into their outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the 2024 10-K, the company notes it is under examination by the IRS for the years 2018-2022 and has received Notices of Proposed Adjustment related to transfer pricing that could result in additional tax liability and penalties. While the company is contesting this, such a dispute with a major regulatory body raises questions. In the past, the company also settled a securities class action lawsuit. While not a direct indictment of current management's integrity, these issues prevent a clear "Yes".
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**
Kraft Heinz scores well on its strategic direction, operational execution, and management depth. The company's strengths lie in its portfolio of iconic brands, extensive distribution network, and a clear strategy for improving margins through efficiencies while investing in growth areas like emerging markets and foodservice. The management team appears stable and focused on a long-term strategy. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the effectiveness of its innovation pipeline and its ability to regain volume and market share in North America. A successful launch of disruptive products that contribute significantly to the top line would flip the "No" on R&D Effectiveness to a "Yes". Similarly, a favorable resolution of the IRS investigation would be critical evidence to change the "No" on Integrity to a "Yes".

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
