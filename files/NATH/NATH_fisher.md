Company: Nathan's Famous, Inc. (NATH)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Financial Press Release (June 10, 2025).
*Note: Direct access to SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q) failed repeatedly during the analysis process. Therefore, this analysis relies on the most recent financial press release and publicly available information regarding the company's business model. A "No" answer is assigned to any point where verifiable evidence could not be found due to this limitation.*

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous is a mature company in a stable industry. Its primary growth comes from its Branded Product Program, which licenses the Nathan's brand to other food manufacturers, and through franchise expansion. The company's fiscal 2025 revenue grew to $148.2 million from $138.6 million in the prior year, a 6.9% increase, suggesting some remaining growth potential. The company also opened twenty-five new franchised locations in fiscal 2025, indicating continued, albeit modest, expansion.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary development appears focused on brand licensing and franchising rather than novel product R&D. The opening of twenty-five new franchised locations in fiscal 2025 demonstrates a commitment to expanding its existing business model into new locations. However, without access to the MD&A section of the 10-K, there is no verifiable evidence of a strategic pipeline for new products or processes beyond this core expansion.
**Answer:** No

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a restaurant and food licensing company, Nathan's Famous does not operate with a formal R&D budget in the way a technology or pharmaceutical company does. Innovation is typically focused on menu variations and marketing. There is no mention of R&D expenditure in the company's financial press releases, and it is not expected to be a material figure.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales are driven through three main channels: company-owned restaurants, franchising, and its Branded Product Program (licensing). The continued growth in revenue and the addition of new franchise locations suggest the sales organization is effective at executing its established model. However, without specific data on sales productivity, channel mix performance, or customer retention, it is impossible to verify if it is "above-average."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal year 2025, Nathan's Famous reported Income from Operations of $36.5 million on revenues of $148.2 million, yielding an operating margin of approximately 24.6%. This is a strong margin for the industry, largely attributable to the high-margin licensing and franchising model which requires less capital than company-owned restaurants. The company's net margin was 16.2% ($24 million net income).
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company's profit margins are high, there is no available evidence from recent press releases or transcripts detailing specific actions being taken to improve them further. This type of information is typically found in the MD&A section of the 10-K or in earnings call transcripts, which were inaccessible or unavailable.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** No verifiable, public evidence on the company's labor relations, employee turnover, or engagement metrics could be found. This information would typically be disclosed in the "Human Capital" section of the 10-K, which was inaccessible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information regarding management stability, succession planning, and board relations is typically found in the annual 10-K and proxy statements. These documents were not accessible, making it impossible to assess the state of executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous is a small-cap company, and information about the depth of its management team beyond the top executives is not readily available without the 10-K filing. There is a potential key-person risk, but it cannot be confirmed or denied with the available sources.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** An assessment of a company's accounting controls requires a review of the independent auditor's report and the statement on internal controls over financial reporting, both contained within the 10-K. As this document was inaccessible, no determination can be made.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The primary competitive advantage for Nathan's Famous is its iconic, 100+ year-old brand, which is synonymous with American hot dogs. The company masterfully reinforces this brand identity through the annual "Nathan's Famous International Hot Dog Eating Contest," a unique and highly effective marketing event that generates significant free media coverage and distinguishes it from all competitors. This brand equity allows for its successful and high-margin licensing business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company pays a regular quarterly dividend, which suggests a focus on returning capital to shareholders rather than aggressively reinvesting all available capital for maximum long-term growth. The lack of earnings calls or detailed long-range strategic plans communicated to investors also points to a focus on steady, predictable performance over ambitious, long-term growth initiatives that might sacrifice short-term profits.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generated $24 million in net income in fiscal 2025 and is in a strong enough position to pay a regular quarterly dividend. This indicates healthy free cash flow and no need to raise capital via dilutive equity financing for its current operational needs or modest growth plans. Its capital-light franchising and licensing model does not require significant capital outlays for expansion.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company does not appear to host regular earnings conference calls with analysts, a standard forum for management to provide detailed updates and answer questions. Communication seems limited to press releases and standard SEC filings. This lack of a public forum for substantive, unscripted discussion suggests a lack of deep investor candor.
**Answer:** No

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information regarding legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or other governance red flags that would be required to assess management's integrity is contained within the 10-K and proxy filings. As these documents were inaccessible, a determination cannot be made.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

---
Synthesis:
Nathan's Famous scores positively on factors related to its core financial strength and brand positioning. The company shows modest growth, maintains very high profit margins due to its capital-light business model, and possesses a powerful, iconic brand that provides a distinct competitive advantage. Its financial health appears strong enough to fund operations and return cash to shareholders without dilution risk. However, the score is significantly hampered by a lack of accessible information and transparency. The absence of earnings calls and the inability to access primary SEC filings during this analysis prevent a positive assessment on crucial points regarding long-range strategy, management depth, internal controls, and overall investor candor. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months if management began hosting quarterly earnings calls, which would provide the evidence needed to potentially flip "No" answers on candor (14), long-range outlook (12), and margin improvement actions (6) to "Yes."

fisher score is 4 / 15
