**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's management identifies two massive addressable markets for growth. The first is a $20 trillion opportunity in consumer payments to convert cash, check, and other payment forms to its network. The second, even larger opportunity is an estimated $200 trillion in "new flows," which includes business-to-business (B2B), person-to-person (P2P), and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments. The company's reported 7% growth in total nominal payments volume for the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, demonstrates continued progress in capturing this potential.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa is actively executing a "network of networks" strategy to expand beyond its core consumer card business. In fiscal 2024, the company signed over 650 commercial partnerships with fintechs, a 30% year-over-year increase. Strategic acquisitions further this commitment; in January 2024, Visa acquired Pismo, a cloud-native issuer processing platform, and in December 2024, it acquired Featurespace, an AI-based payments protection technology firm, to enhance its value-added services. This combination of partnerships and acquisitions shows a clear focus on developing new revenue streams.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa does not disclose a specific Research & Development expense line item, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the company states it has invested over $3 billion in AI and data infrastructure in the last 10 years, and its recent acquisition of Featurespace bolsters its AI capabilities. The continuous rollout of new products within the Visa Protect and Visa Direct suites indicates that investment is yielding results, though the precise efficiency relative to its massive revenue base cannot be quantitatively determined from public filings.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's network scale is evidence of a superior sales and partnership organization. The company works with nearly 14,500 financial institutions, has 4.6 billion payment credentials in circulation, and is accepted at over 150 million merchant locations. The 11% growth in net revenue for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, reflects the sales organization's ability to renew key contracts and expand relationships with both traditional financial institutions and new fintech players.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (Filed July 29, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's profit margins are exceptionally high and lead its primary peer. For fiscal year 2024, the company reported net revenue of $35.9 billion and operating income of $23.6 billion, yielding a GAAP operating margin of 65.7%. This compares favorably to competitor Mastercard, which reported an operating margin of 58.4% for its fiscal year 2024. This demonstrates significant pricing power and operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024), [https://companiesmarketcap.com/mastercard/operating-margin/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/mastercard/operating-margin/) (Accessed August 23, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa focuses on growing its higher-margin, non-volume-based revenue streams. In the nine months ended June 30, 2025, revenue from value-added services grew 22% over the prior-year period. These services, such as risk and identity solutions and acceptance solutions, diversify revenue away from transaction volumes and leverage the company's data and AI capabilities. This strategic shift in revenue mix, combined with operating leverage inherent in its scalable network, supports margin maintenance and potential improvement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (Filed July 29, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa reports strong indicators of positive employee relations. As of September 30, 2024, the company's voluntary workforce turnover (rolling 12-month attrition) was a very low 5%. Furthermore, based on its most recent employee engagement survey cited in the 2024 10-K, 91% of employees would recommend Visa as a great place to work. There is no evidence of significant labor disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability. Ryan McInerney has served as CEO since February 2023, having been with the company since 2013, indicating a planned succession. The broader management team consists of long-tenured executives leading key regions and functions. There have been no recent reports of executive turmoil or abrupt departures, suggesting a stable and effective leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's leadership structure demonstrates significant depth. The executive team includes dedicated presidents for each major geographic region (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, etc.), as well as a Chief Product and Strategy Officer, Chief Technology Officer, and Chief Risk Officer. This structure ensures experienced leadership is in place across all critical business and operational functions, mitigating key person risk at the CEO level.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's financial reporting and controls are robust. The company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. The audit report, included in the 2024 10-K, confirms that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control. There is no history of major restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's primary competitive advantage is the powerful two-sided network effect inherent in its business model. With 4.6 billion credentials and acceptance at over 150 million merchant locations, the value of the network increases for both cardholders and merchants as it grows. This immense scale creates a formidable barrier to entry and a self-reinforcing competitive moat that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes a long-range outlook through its strategic investments. The company's "network of networks" strategy, which includes building out capabilities in new payment flows and value-added services, is a multi-year endeavor. Significant capital is deployed for acquisitions like Pismo ($929 million) and Featurespace ($946 million) to secure long-term technological advantages rather than maximizing near-term earnings. This demonstrates a clear focus on durable growth over short-term profit optimization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (Filed July 29, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's financial position is exceptionally strong. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, the company generated $16.8 billion in cash from operations. Rather than issuing shares, Visa actively returns capital to shareholders, having repurchased $13.2 billion of its Class A common stock during the same period. The combination of massive free cash flow generation and a commitment to share buybacks eliminates the risk of dilutive equity financing for foreseeable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (Filed July 29, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a high degree of transparency in its communications. The "Risk Factors" section of its 2024 10-K is extensive and detailed, frankly discussing threats from regulation, competition, and technology. A review of the company's Q3 2025 earnings call transcript from July 29, 2025 shows management directly addressing analyst questions regarding complex topics like regulatory scrutiny in various global markets and the competitive landscape. This directness in public forums indicates a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa is subject to persistent and significant legal and regulatory challenges regarding its core business practices. The "Legal Proceedings" note in its 2024 10-K and Q3 2025 10-Q details numerous antitrust lawsuits, including the long-running Interchange Multidistrict Litigation and a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. While litigation is common for large firms, the focus of these cases on whether Visa's foundational business model is anti-competitive prevents an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity. The constant legal battles suggest that key stakeholders, including governments and large merchants, seriously question the fairness of Visa's practices.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (Filed July 29, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
Visa scores highly on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting dominant strengths in its market position, profitability, and financial fortitude. The company's powerful network effect, enormous long-term growth opportunities in new payment flows, and exceptional operating margins are standout positives. Management demonstrates a clear long-range outlook, supported by strategic acquisitions and strong internal metrics on personnel relations. The two "No" scores are significant, however. The lack of specific R&D disclosure makes its efficiency hard to judge against its scale, and the persistent, high-profile antitrust litigation prevents a conclusion of "unquestionable integrity." Over the next 12-24 months, the score would most likely be changed by the outcome of major legal battles, such as the DOJ lawsuit. A decisive win could potentially flip the "Integrity" point to Yes, while a significant loss would reinforce the negative view. Evidence that would change the "R&D" score would require Visa to begin disclosing technology or R&D spending as a distinct line item, allowing for direct comparison with peers.

fisher score is 13 / 15
