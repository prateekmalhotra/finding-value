| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Share Repurchase Program | Corporate Action | Near-Term (0-12 months) | Medium (10-20%) | 80% | $140.0 million remaining under the program as of August 6, 2024. |

### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has an active share repurchase program with $140.0 million remaining authorization as of August 6, 2024. Continued execution of this program will reduce the number of outstanding shares.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of shares outstanding, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** 25% of the remaining authorization is used, repurchasing $35 million in shares.
    *   **Base Case:** 50% of the remaining authorization is used, repurchasing $70 million in shares.
    *   **High Case:** 100% of the remaining authorization is used, repurchasing $140 million in shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-15%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has been actively repurchasing shares.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and board authorization.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q and 10-K filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in business could lead to the suspension of the repurchase program.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

**2. Catalyst Title:** New Store Openings
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company continues to open new stores, with six new locations opened in the first half of fiscal 2024. These new stores will contribute to revenue and earnings growth.
*   **Mechanism:** New stores generate incremental revenue and, once mature, contribute to overall profitability, increasing the company's intrinsic value.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** 5 new stores opened in the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Case:** 8 new stores opened in the next 12 months.
    *   **High Case:** 12 new stores opened in the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a consistent track record of new store openings.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful site selection and construction execution.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Company press releases announcing new store openings and quarterly reports detailing the number of new stores.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Delays in construction or permitting could slow the pace of new store openings.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Debt Refinancing
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has $440.0 million in 7.625% senior secured notes maturing on November 1, 2025. Refinancing this debt at a lower interest rate would reduce interest expense and increase net income.
*   **Mechanism:** Lower interest expense directly translates to higher net income and improved free cash flow. This can lead to a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** By November 1, 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Refinancing at a 7.0% interest rate.
    *   **Base Case:** Refinancing at a 6.5% interest rate.
    *   **High Case:** Refinancing at a 6.0% interest rate.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company will need to address this maturity.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Favorable credit market conditions.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Company announcements regarding debt refinancing.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant increase in interest rates could result in refinancing at a higher rate, which would be an anti-catalyst.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program:**

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Shares Outstanding: 39.3 million (as of September 6, 2024).
    *   Current Share Price (for calculation): $45
    *   P/E Multiple: 15x
*   **Base Case Scenario:**
    *   Repurchase Amount: $70 million
    *   Shares Repurchased: $70 million / $45 = 1.56 million shares
    *   New Shares Outstanding: 39.3 million - 1.56 million = 37.74 million
    *   EPS Accretion: (39.3 / 37.74) - 1 = 4.1%
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** ~4%

**2. Debt Refinancing:**

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Debt Amount: $440.0 million
    *   Current Interest Rate: 7.625%
*   **Base Case Scenario:**
    *   New Interest Rate: 6.5%
    *   Annual Interest Savings: $440 million \* (7.625% - 6.5%) = $4.95 million
    *   Net Income Impact (after 21% tax): $4.95 million \* (1 - 0.21) = $3.91 million
    *   **Estimated Valuation Impact (at 15x P/E):** $3.91 million \* 15 = $58.65 million increase in market cap.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Dave & Buster's present a positive outlook. The ongoing share repurchase program and new store openings provide a clear path to EPS and revenue growth. While margin improvements are a positive factor, the impact may be less pronounced than the other two catalysts. Overall, the near-term catalysts are likely to produce positive stock performance in the next 0-12 months.

### **9) Evidence Matrix**

| Citation | Claims/Fields Supported |
| :--- | :--- |
| Form 10-Q, August 6, 2024 | Share repurchase program authorization and activity, new store openings, margin data, debt details, shares outstanding. |
| Form 10-Q, May 5, 2024 | Financial data, share repurchase program details. |
| OpenInsider | Insider trading activity (purchases by CEO and directors in late 2024 and early 2025 are a positive signal). |

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Significant Economic Downturn:** A recession would likely lead to a sharp decline in consumer discretionary spending, negatively impacting Dave & Buster's revenue and profitability.
2.  **Increased Competition:** The entertainment and dining landscape is highly competitive. The emergence of a new, popular competitor could draw customers away from Dave & Buster's.
3.  **Failed Integration of Main Event:** While the acquisition of Main Event is not recent, any unforeseen issues with the integration could lead to operational inefficiencies and negatively impact financial results.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on the analysis, Dave & Buster's presents a compelling investment case with several near-term catalysts. The most significant of these is the company's aggressive share repurchase program, which, combined with new store openings, should provide a tailwind for the stock. A conservative estimate of the combined impact of these catalysts suggests a potential upside in the 10-20% range over the next 12 months. The most important indicator to monitor will be the pace of share repurchases reported in the company's quarterly filings.
