### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | 9.8% | Midpoint of management's FY2025 revenue guidance ($1.595B), implying 9.8% growth over TTM revenue. |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-Y5)** | 25% -> 15% | Reflects continued rapid store expansion, moderating over time from the high-growth phase. This is below the 3-year historical CAGR of ~31% but aligns with long-term store opening goals. |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin** | 10.5% | Slightly above the TTM EBIT margin of 10.03%, assuming modest operating leverage from scale and maturing stores, but held conservative without explicit management guidance on EBIT margin expansion. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 22.0% | Based on the FY 2024 effective tax rate of 21.72%, which is a reasonable proxy for a normalized rate. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 15.7% (Y1), 14.0% (Y2-5) | Year 1 uses the midpoint of capex guidance ($250M) / midpoint of revenue guidance ($1,595M). Outer years use a slightly lower rate as growth moderates. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 1.0% | In line with the TTM Stock-Based Compensation of $15.1M on revenue of $1,452M. |
| **Change in WC as % of Revenue Change** | 5.0% | Based on a historical average, projecting a modest investment in working capital to support growth. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,595.0 | $1,993.8 | $2,442.3 | $2,906.4 | $3,342.3 |
| EBIT | $167.5 | $209.3 | $256.4 | $305.2 | $351.0 |
| NOPAT | $130.6 | $163.3 | $200.0 | $238.0 | $273.7 |
| (+) D&A | $114.1 | $142.6 | $175.0 | $208.2 | $239.3 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $16.0 | $19.9 | $24.4 | $29.1 | $33.4 |
| (-) Capex | $250.0 | $279.1 | $341.9 | $406.9 | $467.9 |
| (-) Change in WC | $7.2 | $19.9 | $22.4 | $23.2 | $21.8 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **-$28.5** | **$6.9** | **$6.3** | **$7.1** | **-$10.1** |

*(Note: Negative FCFF in the near term is driven by aggressive capital expenditures for new store growth, which is consistent with the company's strategy.)*

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity** | **17.55%** | **= Risk-Free Rate + Beta * ERP** |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.30% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (YCharts, August 20, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.00% | Standard market assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta | 2.63 | 5-year monthly beta, reflecting higher volatility than the market, typical of a high-growth stock (MarketBeat, August 20, 2025) |
| **Cost of Debt (after-tax)**| **11.0%** | **= (Interest Expense / Avg. Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate)** |
| Pre-tax Cost of Debt | 14.1% | TTM Interest Expense ($27.8M) / Total Debt ($197.7M) |
| **WACC** | **17.39%** | **= (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-t))** |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $11,190M | Market Capitalization (StockAnalysis, August 18, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $197.7M | Total Debt (StockAnalysis, August 6, 2025) |
| Total Value (V) | $11,387.7M | E + D |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Value | Calculation / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method** | **$8.4M** | **= (FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)** |
| Terminal FCFF | -$9.9M | Based on Year 5 FCFF of -$10.1M, adjusted for growth. |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.5% | Assumed to be in line with long-run inflation expectations. |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| **$4,068M** | **= EBITDA_Y5 * Exit Multiple** |
| EBITDA Year 5 | $614.2M | Calculated as EBIT_Y5 + D&A_Y5 |
| Exit Multiple | 15.0x | A conservative multiple reflecting a mature company, significantly below the current ~48x EV/EBITDA multiple. |

*Judgment:* The Gordon Growth method produces an unusably low (negative) terminal value because the Year 5 FCFF is negative due to high reinvestment. The Exit Multiple method provides a more realistic estimate of the company's value as a mature entity. Therefore, the **Exit Multiple terminal value of $4,068M** will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (USD Millions) | Formula |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF | -$4.1 | Sum of discounted FCFF from Y1-Y5 at 17.39% WACC |
| PV of Terminal Value | $1,829.3 | $4,068M / (1 + 17.39%)^5 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$1,825.2** | **PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value** |
| (-) Net Debt | -$56.7 | Total Debt ($197.7M) - Cash ($254.4M) |
| **Equity Value** | **$1,881.9** | **Enterprise Value - Net Debt** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Fair Value/Share | Key Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **$10.60** | As outlined above. |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$7.50** | Slower revenue growth (20% -> 12%), lower exit multiple (12x). |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$15.00** | Faster revenue growth (30% -> 18%), margin expansion to 11.5%, higher exit multiple (18x). |
| | | |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)**| **$7.42** | **Base Case Value * (1 - 0.30)** |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Valuation Sensitivity:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the terminal exit multiple and the discount rate (WACC). The high beta (2.63) significantly increases the cost of equity and lowers the present value.
2.  **Execution Risk:** The company's growth is predicated on successfully opening and scaling at least 160 new stores per year. Any slowdown in this expansion pace would negatively impact future revenue and cash flow.
3.  **Competitive Pressure:** The specialty coffee market is highly competitive. While Dutch Bros has a loyal following, increased competition from national players like Starbucks and local chains could pressure same-store sales growth and margins.
4.  **Input Cost Volatility:** Coffee and dairy are key inputs with volatile pricing. While the company hedges, significant long-term price increases could erode profitability.
5.  **Reinvestment Assumptions:** The model's negative free cash flow during the forecast period highlights the heavy reinvestment needed for growth. The return on this invested capital must exceed the WACC for value to be created, which is a key uncertainty.

final answer is 10.60 $
