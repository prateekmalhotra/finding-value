Synthesis:
monday.com demonstrates strength across most of Fisher's 15 points, particularly in its product and market potential, sales execution, and financial performance. The company's commitment to innovation and a clear long-range outlook are also notable positives. The primary area for a potential score change in the next 12-24 months would be a more detailed disclosure of labor and personnel relations metrics, which would provide stronger evidence for a "Yes" on that point. A sustained high level of growth and profitability, alongside continued market penetration, would further solidify the existing "Yes" answers. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for labor relations with the publication of employee satisfaction scores or turnover data.

fisher score is 14 / 15
