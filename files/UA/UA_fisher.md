Under Armour, Inc., August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2024, and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour operates in the large and growing global athletic apparel, footwear, and accessories market. However, recent performance indicates significant challenges in capitalizing on this potential. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, total net revenues decreased 10.1% compared to the prior year, with declines in all major product categories: apparel (-8.1%), footwear (-14.7%), and accessories (-5.4%). The North American market, its largest, saw a 14.2% revenue decline, indicating saturation and intense competition. While the company is implementing a restructuring plan to improve profitability, the persistent sales decline across core segments suggests its current product lines may not be positioned for sizable future growth without a significant strategic shift.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's primary focus, as detailed in recent filings, is a significant restructuring plan approved on May 15, 2024. This plan is "designed to rebalance the Company's cost base to further improve profitability and cash flow generation" and is expected to cost between $70 million and $90 million. While this shows a commitment to improving the business, the emphasis is on cost-cutting and operational efficiency rather than explicitly on developing new product lines to drive future top-line growth. The MD&A section mentions a long-term strategy of growing through "increased sales of our apparel, footwear and accessories," which points to a focus on existing categories rather than pioneering new ones.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour does not separately disclose Research and Development expenses in its financial statements, bundling them within "Selling, general and administrative expenses." This lack of transparency makes it impossible to directly assess the effectiveness or scale of its R&D efforts relative to its size or competitors. The MD&A mentions product innovation as a component of SG&A but provides no quantitative details on spending or output metrics like patents or successful new technology platforms. Given the declining sales, particularly in the performance-driven footwear category (-14.7% revenue decline for the quarter ended June 30, 2024), the effectiveness of its current product development efforts is questionable.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm) (Filed November 7, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales performance has been below average, with significant declines across its primary channels. For the three months ended June 30, 2024, wholesale revenue fell 8.3% and direct-to-consumer (DTC) revenue fell 11.8%. The negative trend continued in the subsequent quarter, with wholesale revenue down 12.1% and DTC revenue down 7.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2024. These persistent, broad-based declines, especially in the crucial North American market, indicate significant challenges in sales execution, channel management, and addressing consumer demand, suggesting the sales organization is not performing at an above-average level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm) (Filed November 7, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour's gross margin has shown some improvement, increasing by 110 basis points to 47.5% for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, driven by lower promotions and supply chain benefits. It further improved to 49.8% in the quarter ended September 30, 2024. However, its operating margin is under severe pressure. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the company posted an operating loss of $299.7 million, a stark contrast to the $22.4 million operating income in the prior year, primarily due to a $274 million litigation expense and restructuring charges. Even excluding these charges, the underlying profitability is weak given the revenue declines.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm) (Filed November 7, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively taking steps to improve margins. Gross margin increased to 47.5% in the June 2024 quarter, benefiting from "pricing benefits from lower levels of discounting and promotions" and "supply chain benefits related to lower products costs and lower inventory reserves." The centerpiece of its margin improvement strategy is the 2025 restructuring plan, which aims to "rebalance our cost base to further improve profitability." This plan includes up to $90 million in charges for employee severance, asset impairments, and other transformational initiatives designed to create a more efficient cost structure going forward.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific disclosure in the recent 10-Q filings that provides a clear view of labor and personnel relations. However, the approved 2025 restructuring plan includes charges of approximately $22 million for "employee severance and benefits costs," indicating layoffs are a key component of the cost-cutting measures. While necessary for restructuring, widespread layoffs can negatively impact morale and relations with remaining employees. Without more direct evidence on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations, it is difficult to conclude that relations are "outstanding." The presence of a significant restructuring suggests a period of disruption for personnel.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant executive turnover, which suggests instability. Kevin Plank, the founder, returned as President & CEO in April 2024, replacing Stephanie Linnartz who departed after just over a year in the role. Furthermore, the June 30, 2024 10-Q notes a Separation Agreement with Lisa Collier (former Chief Product Officer) dated August 9, 2023, and the September 30, 2024 10-Q notes a Separation Agreement with Jim Dausch (former Chief Customer Officer) dated August 30, 2024. This level of change at the highest levels, including the short tenure of a recent CEO, indicates executive relations are not currently outstanding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm) (Filed November 7, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent, frequent changes in key leadership roles suggest a lack of management depth and stability. The departure of the CEO after a little over a year and the turnover in other C-suite positions (Chief Product Officer, Chief Customer Officer) create uncertainty about the bench strength of the leadership team. While the return of founder Kevin Plank provides a degree of institutional knowledge, the overall pattern points to a potential weakness in succession planning and leadership continuity. The filings do not provide sufficient detail on the broader management team below the executive level to make a more definitive judgment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm) (Filed November 7, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has self-identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. The 10-Q filed on August 8, 2024, states: "we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We did not design and maintain effective controls over certain aspects of the period-end financial reporting process... [and] over the classification and presentation of general ledger accounts." These weaknesses resulted in immaterial errors and revisions to previously issued financial statements. While the company is implementing a remediation plan, the existence of these control failures indicates that its cost analysis and accounting controls are not currently good.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the athletic apparel industry, brand strength and direct-to-consumer (DTC) execution are critical clues to competitive standing. Under Armour's recent performance indicates weakness in both areas. The 11.8% decline in DTC revenue for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and 7.6% decline in the subsequent quarter, contrasts with an industry trend where strong brands are leveraging DTC for growth. This suggests the brand is struggling to resonate with consumers and drive traffic, a significant disadvantage against larger competitors like Nike and Adidas that command stronger brand loyalty and more robust DTC ecosystems.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000168/ua-20240930.htm) (Filed November 7, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is currently focused on near-term financial stabilization through its 2025 restructuring plan. The plan's objective is to "rebalance our cost base to further improve profitability and cash flow generation," which is a necessary short-range action rather than a long-range investment for growth. While the company continues to invest in marketing and makes capital expenditures on its new headquarters, the overwhelming narrative from recent reports is centered on cost reduction and managing current challenges, not on sacrificing current profits for significant, long-term strategic investments.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position appears adequate to fund operations without near-term equity dilution. As of June 30, 2024, the company held $884.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. It has a $1.1 billion revolving credit facility, with no amounts outstanding as of that date. Rather than issuing equity, the Board authorized a new $500 million share repurchase program for its Class C Common Stock in May 2024, and the company repurchased $40 million worth of stock in the quarter. This indicates confidence in its capital structure and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, not diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings openly address its current struggles. The MD&A section of the June 30, 2024, 10-Q explicitly states that the company "continued to face a challenging retail environment, particularly in North America, that included lower demand in our wholesale channel, in addition to the impacts of proactive strategies to reduce discounting." It also discloses and discusses the material weaknesses in its internal controls and details the costs and rationale behind its restructuring plan. This level of detail about negative trends and internal challenges demonstrates a commitment to transparency with investors during a difficult period.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's integrity is questionable due to a significant securities litigation settlement. On June 20, 2024, the company reached an agreement to settle the *In re Under Armour Securities Litigation* for $434 million. The lawsuit alleged that the company made "false and misleading statements" and engaged in "improper sales and accounting practices, including shifting sales between quarterly periods" between 2015 and 2016. While the company denies wrongdoing, a settlement of this magnitude related to accounting and disclosure practices casts a serious shadow over management's integrity during that period, and the litigation has been a long-running issue.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1336917/000133691724000117/ua-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

---
**Synthesis (5–7 sentences):**
Under Armour currently scores poorly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a business facing significant operational, strategic, and governance challenges. The strongest positives are its balance sheet management, which provides stability and mitigates dilution risk, and its transparent communication with investors regarding its current struggles. The most significant negatives are declining sales across all key products and channels, executive instability, identified material weaknesses in accounting controls, and a massive litigation settlement that raises questions about integrity. The variables most likely to change this score in the next 12-24 months hinge on the success of the 2025 restructuring plan and the strategic direction under founder Kevin Plank's renewed leadership. To flip the numerous "No" answers to "Yes," Under Armour must provide evidence of a sustained sales recovery driven by product innovation, stabilize its executive team, and fully remediate its internal control weaknesses.

**fisher score is 3 / 15**
