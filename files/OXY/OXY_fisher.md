**Occidental Petroleum Corporation, August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed.**

### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's core business is oil and gas exploration and production, a mature industry, but the company is also investing in lower-carbon ventures. OLCV is advancing leading-edge technologies and decarbonization solutions, including direct air capture. In its 2024 10-K filing, Occidental states that OLCV is advancing leading-edge technologies and decarbonization solutions, including direct air capture, lithium development and near-zero emissions power, that seek to economically grow the business while reducing emissions. The success of these ventures could provide a long runway for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's management has demonstrated a commitment to developing new products and processes. The company is investing in low-carbon ventures, such as the STRATOS direct air capture facility, which is expected to begin operations in mid-2025. According to the 2024 10-K, OLCV also invests in third-party entities developing technologies to advance other low-carbon initiatives, including NET Power, an energy technology company building its first utility-scale plant to provide near-zero emissions electricity by 2028. This indicates a clear commitment to developing new business lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While specific R&D expenditure figures as a percentage of revenue are not readily available in the browsed documents, Occidental's investment in low-carbon ventures suggests a focus on innovation. The 2024 10-K mentions that OLCV is advancing leading-edge technologies and decarbonization solutions. The development of the STRATOS direct air capture facility is a tangible result of these efforts. However, without more detailed metrics, it is difficult to assess the overall effectiveness of their R&D relative to the company's size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided documents do not contain specific details about Occidental's sales organization, such as sales coverage, channel mix, or win rates. While the company's revenue figures indicate a successful sales function, there is not enough information to determine if it is "above-average" compared to its peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the first quarter of 2025, Occidental reported income from continuing operations of $945 million on net sales of $6.803 billion, resulting in a profit margin of approximately 13.9%. For the full year 2024, the company reported income from continuing operations of $2.896 billion on net sales of $26.725 billion, for a profit margin of about 10.8%. While these margins are substantial, a more detailed comparison to industry peers would be needed to definitively say they are "worthwhile."
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental focuses on being a low-cost producer to maintain and improve profit margins. The 2024 10-K states that Occidental's competitive strategy relies on producing hydrocarbons in a capital-efficient manner and that OxyChem's competitive strategy is to be a low-cost producer of its products. The company also works to manage inflation impacts by capitalizing on operational efficiencies and locking in pricing on longer-term contracts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's 2024 10-K highlights several initiatives aimed at fostering positive labor and personnel relations, including a "Balanced Workplace Program" offering flexible work arrangements and an enhanced mental health benefit through Lyra Health. The company also has a global program called STEP to recruit, develop, and retain petrotechnical professionals. These programs suggest a focus on employee well-being and development. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 887 of Occidental's 13,323 employees were unionized.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided documents do not offer specific details about the relationships between Occidental's executives. However, the executive team listed in the 2024 10-K appears stable, with several executives having long tenures at the company. The company also hosts quarterly executive virtual conversations led by the CEO to enhance engagement with employees, which may suggest a cohesive executive team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's 2024 10-K lists a number of executive officers beyond the CEO, including presidents of various operating divisions. This suggests a degree of management depth. The company's global STEP was formed to recruit, develop and retain highly skilled and valued geoscientists, engineers, scientists and other petrotechnical professionals who collectively drive innovation, advance performance and inspire the future of energy development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's 2024 10-K includes a report from their independent registered public accounting firm, which states that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company also provides detailed segment disclosures in its financial statements. This suggests that Occidental has good cost analysis and accounting controls in place.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's expertise in carbon dioxide (CO2) enhanced oil recovery (EOR) gives it a competitive advantage. The 2024 10-K states that Occidental believes its core competencies in CO2 separation, transportation, use, recycling and storage in EOR provide a competitive advantage over its peers as the world transitions to a less carbon-intensive economy. This expertise also provides a foundation for its growing low-carbon ventures business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's significant investments in low-carbon ventures, which are not expected to generate substantial profits in the short term, indicate a long-range outlook. The 2024 10-K outlines the company's strategy to advance technologies and decarbonization solutions to develop a sustainable low-carbon business. This willingness to invest in future growth areas, even at the expense of short-term profits, is a key indicator of a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's financial position appears strong enough to fund foreseeable growth. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $2.612 billion in cash and cash equivalents. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $2.148 billion. While the company did issue common stock as part of the CrownRock acquisition, its shareholder return priorities are to provide a sustainable and growing dividend and reduce the principal of outstanding debt below $15 billion, before resuming share repurchases.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000076/oxy-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000076/oxy-20250331.htm) (May 7, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's investor relations website provides access to a variety of materials, including earnings call transcripts, SEC filings, and investor presentations. The availability of transcripts from as far back as 2007 suggests a history of communication with investors. The company also provides detailed risk factors in its 10-K, which indicates a willingness to be transparent about potential challenges.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OXY/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OXY/transcripts/) (August 20, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided documents to suggest a lack of integrity on the part of Occidental's management. The company has a detailed section on its website about its commitment to sustainability and social responsibility. The 2024 10-K includes an independent auditor's report on the company's internal controls, which did not identify any material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Occidental Petroleum Corporation scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-range outlook, commitment to new technologies, and financial strength. The company's investment in low-carbon ventures, particularly direct air capture, is a significant positive that could drive future growth. However, the lack of detailed information on the effectiveness of its R&D and the quality of its sales organization leads to "No" answers on those points. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful launch and scaling of the STRATOS direct air capture facility, which would provide concrete evidence of R&D effectiveness, and a significant improvement in profit margins. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" on R&D effectiveness if the company were to disclose more specific metrics on its R&D spending and a clearer link between that spending and new product revenue. Similarly, more disclosure on sales force productivity and market share gains would be needed to change the answer on the sales organization.
