Of course. This is a well-structured valuation, but you've correctly identified several areas where the assumptions could be refined to better reflect a realistic, "just-right" base case. The original analysis leans heavily conservative, particularly in its growth and terminal value assumptions, leading to a very low valuation.

Here is a revised valuation that adjusts key assumptions to be more balanced, addresses the flaws you noted, and provides a more realistic intrinsic value estimate.

### **PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price. This analysis remains unchanged as it accurately frames the market's high expectations.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$193.78** (at close, August 27, 2025) (Source: StockAnalysis.com, Aug 28, 2025).

2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM as of June 30, 2025):**

| Metric | Value (in millions) | Source (all StockAnalysis.com, Aug 28, 2025) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,227.0 | Income Statement |
| Gross Margin | 41.7% | Income Statement |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $371.9 | Income Statement |
| Net Income | $351.8 | Income Statement |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $51.9 | Income Statement (derived from EBITDA-EBIT) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $32.2 | Cash Flow Statement |
| Capital Expenditures | ($52.2) | Cash Flow Statement |
| Change in Working Capital | ($21.5) | Cash Flow Statement |
| Interest Expense | ($21.4) | Income Statement |
| Cash & Equivalents | $332.2 | Balance Sheet |
| Total Debt | $60.3 | Balance Sheet |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 58.0 | Income Statement |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the market's expectations, we solve for the revenue growth rate that justifies the current enterprise value, holding the TTM operating margin of 16.7% constant.

*   **Market Capitalization:** $193.78/share * 58.0M shares = $11,239.3M
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $11,239.3M (Market Cap) + $60.3M (Debt) - $332.2M (Cash) = **$10,967.4M**
*   **WACC:** 11.00% (See Part 2 for detailed calculation)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5% (Assumed long-run inflation)

After iterating a 5-year DCF model, the calculation shows that to arrive at the current enterprise value of $10,967.4M, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 19.5%**.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify Crane's current stock price of $193.78, one must believe the company can grow its revenue by nearly 20% annually for the next five years while maintaining its historically strong 16.7% operating margin. This represents a highly optimistic outlook.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

This section builds a valuation based on independent, revised assumptions grounded in historical performance and realistic forward-looking expectations.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** The original 6.0% tapering to 4.0% was overly conservative given recent momentum (14.5% in 2024). A more realistic forecast acknowledges tailwinds in key aerospace and industrial markets while still being prudent. We will model **7.0% growth in Year 1, tapering by 0.5% annually to 5.0% in Year 5.** This balances recent strength with the reality of economic cycles.
*   **Operating Margin:** The original assumption of 16.0% (3-year average) ignores the most recent TTM performance of 16.7%. A more realistic assumption is that the company can maintain most of its recent efficiency gains. We will use a stable **16.5% operating margin**, slightly below the TTM peak but above the historical average.
*   **Taxes:** The **22.0% effective tax rate** is a reasonable and normalized assumption. This remains unchanged.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeling Capex at **2.5% of annual revenue** is a sound assumption for an industrial company needing to invest for growth and maintenance. This remains unchanged.
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeling the change in working capital as **6.0% of the change in revenue** remains a solid, historically grounded assumption. This remains unchanged.
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:** The original model conservatively assumed a flat share count. In reality, mature, profitable companies like Crane often reduce their share count over time via buybacks. A more realistic model assumes a modest but consistent buyback program that more than offsets SBC dilution. We will model a **1.0% annual reduction in diluted shares outstanding**, starting from the **57.55 million** baseline.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION (REVISED)**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| ($ in millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,382.9 | $2,537.8 | $2,690.1 | $2,838.0 | $2,979.9 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *7.0%* | *6.5%* | *6.0%* | *5.5%* | *5.0%* |
| EBIT (16.5% Margin) | $393.2 | $418.7 | $443.9 | $468.3 | $491.7 |
| EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) | $306.7 | $326.6 | $346.2 | $365.3 | $383.5 |
| + D&A (2.3% of Rev) | $54.8 | $58.4 | $61.9 | $65.3 | $68.5 |
| - SBC (1.4% of Rev) | ($33.4) | ($35.5) | ($37.7) | ($39.7) | ($41.7) |
| - Capex (2.5% of Rev) | ($59.6) | ($63.4) | ($67.3) | ($71.0) | ($74.5) |
| - Change in NWC | ($9.4) | ($9.3) | ($9.1) | ($8.9) | ($8.5) |
| **FCFF** | **$259.2** | **$276.7** | **$294.0** | **$311.0** | **$327.3** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

The WACC calculation remains robust and does not require changes to its core inputs.

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** 11.04% (4.24% Risk-Free Rate + 1.36 Beta * 5.0% ERP)
*   **Cost of Debt:** 4.29% (5.5% Pre-Tax Rate * (1 - 22.0% Tax Rate))
*   **WACC Calculation:** Using current market values for E and D.
    *   (99.5% * 11.04%) + (0.5% * 4.29%) = 10.98% + 0.02% = **11.00%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE (REVISED)**

The original model correctly identified that the Gordon Growth implied multiple was too low. The chosen 12.0x exit multiple was a step in the right direction but still at the low end of the historical range for a stable industrial peer (12-14x).

*   **Gordon Growth Method (Sanity Check):**
    *   *Formula:* TV = FCFF_5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
    *   *Calculation:* $327.3 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.1100 - 0.025) = $335.5 / 0.085 = **$3,946.8M**.
    *   This implies a terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of **7.0x** ($3,946.8M / ($491.7M EBIT + $68.5M D&A)). This confirms the multiple is still too low and the Exit Multiple method is more appropriate.
*   **Exit Multiple Method (Primary Method):**
    *   We will use a terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of **13.0x**, which represents the midpoint of the historical 12x-14x range. This is a more realistic long-term assumption for a quality industrial company, reflecting a normalization from today's high valuations but fairly valuing its future stable earnings.
    *   *Revised TV (Exit Multiple):* 13.0 * (EBIT_5 $491.7M + D&A_5 $68.5M) = 13.0 * $560.2M = **$7,282.6M**.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE (REVISED)**

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:** ($259.2/1.11^1) + ... + ($327.3/1.11^5) = **$1,085.1M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $7,282.6M / (1.11^5) = **$4,321.3M**
*   **Enterprise Value:** $1,085.1M + $4,321.3M = **$5,406.4M**
*   **Equity Value Calculation:**
    *   *Formula:* Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash & Equivalents
    *   *Calculation:* $5,406.4M - $60.3M + $332.2M = **$5,678.3M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY (REVISED)**

*   **Projected Shares in Year 5:** 57.55M * (1 - 0.01)^5 = **54.72M shares**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Formula:* Equity Value / Projected Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   *Calculation:* $5,678.3M / 54.72M shares = **$103.77**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $103.77**. Assumes high-single-digit growth tapering to mid-single-digits and sustained strong margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$80**. Assumes lower growth (3-4%) and margin compression to 15% due to a mild recession.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$135**. Assumes the company beats expectations, delivering 8-10% growth and expanding margins to 17.5%.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors.
    *   *MOS Price:* $103.77 * (1 - 0.30) = **$72.64**

**Risk Notes (Updated)**

1.  **Cyclicality:** Crane's end-markets (aerospace, industrial) are cyclical. An economic downturn could significantly reduce demand, impacting revenue and profitability more than modeled.
2.  **Margin Pressure:** The base case assumes stable, strong margins. Increased raw material costs, supply chain disruptions, or competitive pricing pressure could erode profitability.
3.  **Integration Risk:** Future growth may depend on acquisitions. There is a risk of overpaying for assets or failing to integrate them effectively, leading to value destruction.
4.  **High Market Expectations:** The stark difference between the market-implied value (Part 1) and this revised valuation (Part 2) still highlights significant optimism priced into the stock, posing a high risk of de-rating if growth expectations are not met.
5.  **Capital Allocation Risk:** This valuation assumes a consistent 1% annual share buyback. A shift in management's capital allocation strategy (e.g., towards a large M&A deal or debt reduction) would alter the per-share value outcome.

final answer is 103.77 $
