Of course. Below is a revised valuation of Flutter Entertainment plc, addressing the issues in the original analysis while maintaining the same comprehensive format.

The original analysis was well-structured but contained two key areas that warranted revision to better reflect a realistic, "just right" scenario:

1.  **Operating Margin Assumption:** The original model held the operating margin flat at 9.0%. This is likely too conservative, as it ignores the significant operating leverage and maturing profitability of Flutter's high-growth U.S. segment (FanDuel). As this highly profitable segment becomes a larger portion of the total business, the consolidated group margin should naturally expand.
2.  **Terminal Value Calculation:** The original model's Gordon Growth method resulted in an exit EV/EBITDA multiple of 10.85x. While not unreasonable, this may understate the long-term value of a market leader with a powerful brand portfolio. Switching to a direct, slightly higher exit multiple that reflects a premium for market leadership provides a more realistic terminal value.

The following report corrects these flaws by modeling modest margin expansion and applying a more appropriate terminal multiple.

### PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1) **Current Market Price**: The market price for FLUT is **$197.08** as of August 22, 2025.

2) **Baseline Financials (TTM)**:

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source & Date |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | $15,137 | August 22, 2025 |
| Gross Margin | 60.1% | August 22, 2025 |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $1,289 | August 22, 2025 |
| Net Income | $696 | August 22, 2025 |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $1,572 | August 22, 2025 |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $430 | August 22, 2025 |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | ($498) | August 22, 2025 |
| Change in Working Capital | ($180) | Inferred from August 22, 2025 |
| Interest Expense | $593 | August 22, 2025 |
| Cash & Equivalents | $1,805 | August 22, 2025 |
| Total Debt | $6,375 | August 22, 2025 |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 177.3 million | August 22, 2025 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current enterprise value of approximately $39.2 billion (Market Cap of $34.9B + Net Debt of $4.6B), the market must believe in a specific set of growth and profitability assumptions. Using a WACC of 8.02% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5% (details in Part 2), the market is pricing in the following:

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue CAGR: ~14.5%**
*   **Market-Implied Operating Margin: ~12.5%** (expanding from the current 8.5%)

This combination of sustained high-growth and significant margin expansion is what is required to justify the current market price of $197.08.

### PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

My assumptions aim for a realistic base case, moderating the market's aggressive outlook while correcting the overly conservative assumptions from the previous analysis.

7) **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5)**:
*   The original tapering growth model is sound. It acknowledges continued strength in the U.S. while respecting the law of large numbers for a company of this scale.
*   **My Assumption**: I will use a tapering growth model: **12% in Year 1, tapering by 1.5% annually to 6% in Year 5.**

8) **Operating Margin (EBIT)**:
*   The TTM operating margin is 8.5%. Holding this flat ignores the margin-accretive effect of the rapidly scaling and highly profitable U.S. business. A gradual expansion is more realistic as fixed costs are leveraged and promotional intensity in the U.S. normalizes.
*   **My Assumption**: I will model a gradual expansion of the **operating margin from 9.2% in Year 1 to 11.0% by Year 5**. This is a more realistic trajectory than the market's implied 12.5% or the previous model's flat 9.0%.

9) **Taxes**:
*   **My Assumption**: I will use a **normalized effective tax rate of 21%**, which remains a reasonable long-term assumption.

10) **Capital Intensity**:
*   The original assumptions based on historical averages are logical.
*   **My Assumption (Capex)**: Capex will remain at **3.3% of annual revenue**.
*   **My Assumption (Working Capital)**: Change in NWC will be **1.5% of the incremental revenue** each year.

11) **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks**:
*   **My Assumption**: Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) will remain constant at **2.8% of revenue**. The **diluted share count will be held constant at 177.3 million**, assuming buybacks offset SBC-related dilution.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated using a conservative method that treats Stock-Based Compensation as a cash outflow to fully capture its economic cost to shareholders.
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $16,953 | $18,818 | $20,606 | $22,151 | $23,480 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *9.2%* | *9.6%* | *10.1%* | *10.5%* | *11.0%* |
| EBIT | $1,560 | $1,807 | $2,081 | $2,326 | $2,583 |
| NOPAT | $1,232 | $1,427 | $1,644 | $1,837 | $2,040 |
| D&A (10.4% of Rev) | $1,763 | $1,957 | $2,143 | $2,304 | $2,442 |
| Capex (3.3% of Rev) | ($560) | ($621) | ($680) | ($731) | ($775) |
| SBC (2.8% of Rev) | ($475) | ($527) | ($577) | ($620) | ($657) |
| Change in NWC | ($27) | ($28) | ($27) | ($23) | ($20) |
| **FCFF** | **$1,933** | **$2,208** | **$2,503** | **$2,767** | **$3,030** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14) **Cost of Equity (CAPM)**:
*   Risk-Free Rate: 4.10% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 2025).
*   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%.
*   Beta: 1.15.
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.10% + 1.15 * 5.0% = 9.85%**

15) **Cost of Debt**:
*   After-tax Cost of Debt = 9.3% * (1 - 21%) = 7.35%.

16) **WACC**:
*   Market Value of Equity = $34.9B; Market Value of Debt = $6.4B; Total Capital = $41.3B.
*   **WACC = ($34.9/$41.3 * 9.85%) + ($6.4/$41.3 * 7.35%) = 8.32% + 1.14% = 8.02%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17) **Exit Multiple Method**:
*   The Gordon Growth method is highly sensitive to its inputs and the implied 10.85x multiple in the prior analysis felt low for a market leader. The Exit Multiple method provides a more robust valuation anchor based on what a rational acquirer might pay for the business in a mature state.
*   A multiple of **11.5x EV/EBITDA** is more appropriate. This reflects a premium for Flutter's market-leading brands (especially FanDuel), diversification, and scale, while still being a conservative multiple for a company in this sector.
*   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($2,583M) + Year 5 D&A ($2,442M) = $5,025M.
*   **Terminal Value = $5,025M * 11.5x = $57,788M**

18) **Implied Growth Rate Cross-Check**:
*   The terminal value of $57,788M implies a perpetuity growth rate (g).
*   `g = (WACC * TV - Final Year FCFF) / (TV + Final Year FCFF)`
*   `g = (8.02% * $57,788 - $3,030) / ($57,788 + $3,030) = 3.3%`
*   An implied long-term growth rate of 3.3% is higher than the long-term inflation target but is justifiable for a capital-light, market-leading digital business with pricing power. This confirms the 11.5x multiple is aggressive but not unrealistic.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19) **Enterprise Value**:
*   PV of FCFF = $1,789 + $1,892 + $1,977 + $2,036 + $2,055 = $9,749M
*   PV of Terminal Value = $57,788M / (1.0802)^5 = $39,186M
*   **Enterprise Value = $9,749M + $39,186M = $48,935M**

20) **Equity Value**:
*   Net Debt = Total Debt ($6,375M) - Cash ($1,805M) = $4,570M.
*   **Equity Value = $48,935M - $4,570M = $44,365M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21) **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**:
*   **Fair Value Per Share = $44,365M / 177.3M shares = $250.23**

22) **Valuation Range**:
*   **Base Case: $250.23**. (Assumptions as listed above).
*   **Low/Bear Case: $195**. (Slower growth at 8% tapering to 4%, margins expand only to 9.5%).
*   **High/Bull Case: $310**. (Faster growth at 15% tapering to 8%, margins expand to 12.0%).

23) **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**:
*   A 30% margin of safety from the base-case estimate is prudent.
*   **MOS Price = $250.23 * (1 - 0.30) = $175.16**

### Risk Notes

1.  **Regulatory Risk**: The online betting and gaming industry is subject to evolving and complex regulations across different jurisdictions, which could impact market access and profitability.
2.  **Competition**: The market is intensely competitive. Failure to innovate and maintain market share, especially in the key U.S. market, could pressure growth and margins.
3.  **U.S. Profitability**: The valuation is increasingly dependent on the margin trajectory of the U.S. business. Any slowdown in profitability or increase in promotional spending would negatively impact the forecast.
4.  **Integration Risk**: Flutter has a history of large-scale acquisitions. Any future M&A activity carries risks related to successful integration and synergy realization.
5.  **Debt Load**: The company carries a significant amount of debt, making it sensitive to interest rate fluctuations and requiring substantial cash flow to service.
