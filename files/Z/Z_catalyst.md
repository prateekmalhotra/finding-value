### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Zillow Group has an active share repurchase program with $381 million remaining available for future repurchases as of June 30, 2024. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, with $301 million in repurchases in the first six months of 2024.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can signal management's confidence in the company's future prospects, leading to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: $100 million in repurchases, reducing share count by approximately 2.3 million shares (assuming an average price of $43/share).
    *   Base Case: $200 million in repurchases, reducing share count by approximately 4.7 million shares.
    *   High Case: $381 million in repurchases, reducing share count by approximately 8.9 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-10%). Based on a 2-4% reduction in share count and the positive signal to the market.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a history of executing on its repurchase authorizations.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a favorable stock price for repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for share repurchase activity.
    *   Cash flow from operations in quarterly reports.
    *   Stock price movements.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant acquisition or downturn in the business could divert cash to other priorities.

*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases in upcoming quarterly reports.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Growth in Rentals Marketplace
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Zillow's Rentals segment is experiencing rapid growth, with a 29% year-over-year revenue increase in the second quarter of 2024. This growth is driven by an increase in multifamily property listings and a rise in quarterly revenue per average monthly rentals unique visitor.
*   **Mechanism:** Continued growth in the high-margin Rentals segment will improve overall profitability and demonstrate the success of Zillow's "housing super app" strategy, leading to a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: 15% YoY revenue growth in the Rentals segment.
    *   Base Case: 25% YoY revenue growth in the Rentals segment.
    *   High Case: 35% YoY revenue growth in the Rentals segment.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). Continued double-digit growth in a key segment would likely lead to a re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has demonstrated strong execution in this segment.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued growth in multifamily property listings and user engagement.

*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Zillow Home Loans is rapidly expanding its mortgage origination business, with a 123% year-over-year increase in total loan origination volume in the second quarter of 2024. This growth is primarily driven by purchase loan originations.
*   **Mechanism:** As Zillow Home Loans captures a larger share of the mortgage market, it will contribute more significantly to Zillow's overall revenue and profitability, demonstrating the value of integrating financial services into the home buying process.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: 50% YoY growth in loan origination volume.
