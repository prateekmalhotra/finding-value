### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Aggressive Share Repurchases
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Crocs has a share repurchase program with $700.0 million remaining for future repurchases as of June 30, 2024. The company repurchased 1.2 million shares for $175.0 million in the second quarter of 2024.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Crocs repurchases an additional $200 million of stock at an average price of $150/share, retiring 1.33 million shares.
    *   **Base Case:** Crocs repurchases $400 million of stock at an average price of $150/share, retiring 2.67 million shares.
    *   **High Case:** Crocs repurchases the full $700 million of stock at an average price of $150/share, retiring 4.67 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (5-15%). Based on the Base Case, a repurchase of 2.67 million shares would reduce the share count by about 4.5% (based on 59.6 million shares outstanding as of June 30, 2024), which could lead to a similar increase in the stock price, all else being equal.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a history of share repurchases and a significant authorization in place.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must continue to generate strong free cash flow to fund the repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports (Form 10-Q) for "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities," cash flow from operations, and any announcements of new or expanded repurchase programs.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in the business could force the company to preserve cash and suspend the repurchase program. An increase in the stock price would make repurchases less accretive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases in the upcoming quarterly reports.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Crocs Brand International Growth
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Crocs brand continues to experience strong growth in international markets, with revenues increasing by 18.7% in the second quarter of 2024. This growth is a key driver of the company's overall performance.
*   **Mechanism:** Strong international growth can lead to higher-than-expected revenue and earnings, causing analysts to revise their estimates upwards and leading to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** International growth slows to 10% annually.
    *   **Base Case:** International growth continues at a 15% annual rate.
    *   **High Case:** International growth accelerates to 20% annually.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). Continued strong international growth can significantly impact the company's valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a strong track record of international growth.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued brand relevance in key international markets like China and Europe, and successful marketing campaigns.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports (Form 10-Q) for Crocs Brand revenue broken down by geography, and management commentary on international performance.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A global recession, a strengthening of the US dollar, or increased competition in international markets could slow growth.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The international growth story for the Crocs brand is strong and appears sustainable.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** HEYDUDE Brand Turnaround
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The HEYDUDE brand has been underperforming, with revenues decreasing by 17.5% in the second quarter of 2024. A successful turnaround of the brand could unlock significant value.
*   **Mechanism:** A return to growth for the HEYDUDE brand would significantly increase the company's overall revenue and profitability, leading to a higher valuation. The market is currently assigning little value to the HEYDUDE brand, so a turnaround would be a major positive surprise.
*   **Timing:** August 2026 – August 2030.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** HEYDUDE revenues continue to decline.
    *   **Base Case:** HEYDUDE revenues stabilize and return to low single-digit growth.
    *   **High Case:** HEYDUDE revenues return to double-digit growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A successful turnaround of the HEYDUDE brand could lead to a significant re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 50%. Turnarounds are difficult, but Crocs has a strong management team with a track record of success.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful new product introductions, effective marketing campaigns, and a stabilization of the brand's image.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports (Form 10-Q) for HEYDUDE brand revenue, and management commentary on turnaround efforts.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** The HEYDUDE brand could be a fad that has passed its peak. The company may not be able to successfully innovate and market the brand to a new generation of consumers.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The HEYDUDE turnaround is a high-risk, high-reward situation. Investors should look for signs of stabilization before investing.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Aggressive Share Repurchases:**
*   **Formula:** EPS Impact = (Net Income / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) - (Net Income / Shares Outstanding)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Net Income: $950.1 million (FY 2024)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 59.6 million (as of June 30, 2024)
    *   Shares Repurchased (Base Case): 2.67 million
*   **Calculation:**
    *   New Shares Outstanding = 59.6 million - 2.67 million = 56.93 million
    *   New EPS = $950.1 million / 56.93 million = $16.69
    *   Old EPS = $950.1 million / 59.6 million = $15.94
    *   EPS Impact = $16.69 - $15.94 = $0.75 (a 4.7% increase)

**2. HEYDUDE Brand Turnaround:**
*   **Formula:** Revenue Impact = (HEYDUDE Revenue * (1 + Growth Rate)) - HEYDUDE Revenue
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   HEYDUDE Revenue: $824.1 million (FY 2024)
    *   Growth Rate (Base Case): 5%
*   **Calculation:**
    *   New HEYDUDE Revenue = $824.1 million * (1 + 0.05) = $865.3 million
    *   Revenue Impact = $865.3 million - $824.1 million = $41.2 million (a 1% increase in total company revenue)

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A severe global recession:** This would likely lead to a significant decline in consumer spending on discretionary items like footwear, which would negatively impact both the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands.
2.  **Failure to innovate:** The footwear industry is highly competitive, and a failure to innovate and introduce new products that resonate with consumers could lead to a decline in market share and profitability.
3.  **Supply chain disruptions:** The company relies on third-party manufacturers in Asia, and any disruptions to the supply chain could lead to product shortages and lost sales.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

The near-term outlook for Crocs is positive, with the aggressive share repurchase program and continued strong international growth for the Crocs brand providing a favorable tailwind. The potential for a turnaround of the HEYDUDE brand represents a significant long-term opportunity, but also a significant risk. We recommend a "Buy" rating with a one-year price target of $175, representing approximately 15% upside from current levels. The most important indicator to monitor is the performance of the HEYDUDE brand in the upcoming quarterly reports.
