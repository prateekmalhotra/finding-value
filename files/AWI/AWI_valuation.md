**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions embedded in the current stock price, we first establish a discount rate (WACC) and then solve for the growth rate that justifies the price.

*   **Preliminary WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
        *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
        *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.5%** (Standard market premium).
        *   Beta: **1.43** (Sourced from multiple outlets, reflecting cyclicality).
        *   *Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.43 * 5.5% = 12.13%*
    *   **Cost of Debt:**
        *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = $36.8M / $565.7M = 6.50%
        *   After-tax Cost of Debt (using 23.3% TTM tax rate) = 6.50% * (1 - 0.233) = 4.99%
    *   **Market Value Weights:**
        *   Market Cap = $193.54 * 43.85M shares = $8,487M
        *   Market Value of Equity (E) = $8,487M
        *   Market Value of Debt (D) = $565.7M
        *   *WACC = (E / (E+D)) * CoE + (D / (E+D)) * CoD = (8487/9052.7) * 12.13% + (565.7/9052.7) * 4.99% = 11.37% + 0.31% = **11.68%***

**3 & 4) Solving for Market-Implied Growth:**

With a WACC of 11.68% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, and holding the TTM operating margin of 20.1% constant, the model requires a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 14.5%** to arrive at the current market price of $193.54.

**5) Market-Implied Thesis:**
To justify today's stock price of $193.54, one must believe that Armstrong World Industries can grow its revenue at a compounded rate of **14.5% per year for the next five years**, while maintaining its current TTM operating margin of **20.1%**. This appears to be a highly optimistic scenario for a mature company in a cyclical industry.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6 & 7) Revenue for Years 1â€“5:**
The market-implied growth of 14.5% is aggressive. A more realistic view acknowledges near-term strength from recent projects while assuming a normalization toward long-term GDP-plus growth.
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** Revenue growth of **8.0% in Year 1, tapering down by 1.0% each year to 4.0% in Year 5.** This balances current momentum with the cyclical nature of the construction industry.

**8) Margin Path:**
The TTM operating margin of 20.1% is strong but may not be sustainable. Competitive pressures and cost inflation are persistent risks. A slight moderation towards the historical average of ~19.5% is more prudent.
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** Operating margin starts at **20.1% in Year 1 and gently declines by 0.1% per year to 19.7% by Year 5.** This reflects sustained efficiency offset by modest competitive pressure.

**9) Taxes:**
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** A consistent effective tax rate of **23.5%**, in line with recent history.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** TTM Capex was 5.6% of revenue. The 3-year average is 6.2%. An average of these periods is a reasonable forecast.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Capex remains at **5.9% of revenue** annually.
*   **Working Capital:** A normalized assumption is more appropriate than TTM figures.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Change in Working Capital will require **5.0% of the change in revenue** each year.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** A net **0.8% annual reduction** in diluted shares outstanding, reflecting the company's historical capital return policy balancing buybacks against SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Formula:**
FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital
*(Note: Stock-Based Compensation is a non-cash expense already deducted to arrive at EBIT. By not adding it back, we are treating it as a real economic cost to shareholders, which is a conservative and common practice.)*

**13) FCFF Rationale:**
FCFF is used because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity), making it ideal for an enterprise-level valuation using WACC.

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,686.96 | $1,805.05 | $1,913.35 | $2,008.02 | $2,088.34 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *8.0%* | *7.0%* | *6.0%* | *5.0%* | *4.0%* |
| EBIT Margin | 20.1% | 20.0% | 19.9% | 19.8% | 19.7% |
| EBIT | $339.08 | $361.01 | $380.76 | $397.59 | $411.40 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 76.5%) | $259.39 | $276.17 | $291.29 | $304.16 | $314.72 |
| Add: D&A (7.25% of Rev) | $122.30 | $130.87 | $138.72 | $145.58 | $151.41 |
| Less: Capex (5.9% of Rev) | ($99.53) | ($106.50) | ($112.89) | ($118.47) | ($123.21) |
| Less: Chg in WC (5% of Chg Rev) | ($6.25) | ($5.90) | ($5.41) | ($4.73) | ($4.02) |
| **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** | **$275.92** | **$294.63** | **$311.70** | **$326.54** | **$338.90** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

The WACC of 11.69% calculated in Part 1 is appropriate for discounting the explicit 5-year forecast period, as it reflects the company's current risk profile.
*   **WACC for Years 1-5:** **11.69%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

The original analysis correctly noted a major flaw: using a high WACC for a perpetuity calculation results in an unreasonably low terminal value. For the terminal period, we assume the company is mature and less risky, thus requiring a lower, more sustainable discount rate.

**16) Terminal Discount Rate (WACC):**
*   **Terminal Beta:** Assumed to be **1.10**, reflecting a mature company but with some remaining cyclicality (lower than the current 1.43).
*   **Terminal Cost of Equity:** 4.26% + 1.10 * 5.5% = **10.31%**
*   **Terminal WACC (assuming 90% E, 10% D):** (0.90 * 10.31%) + (0.10 * 4.97%) = 9.28% + 0.50% = **9.78%**

**17) Gordon Growth Method:**
*   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**, reflecting long-term sustainable economic growth.
*   Terminal Value = [FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)] / (Terminal WACC - g)
*   Terminal Value = [$338.90 * (1.025)] / (9.78% - 2.5%) = $347.37 / 0.0728 = **$4,771.60M**

**18) Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $411.40M + $151.41M = $562.81M
*   Realistic Long-Term EV/EBITDA Multiple: **10.0x**, a more sustainable multiple for the building products sector compared to the peak of 14.7x.
*   Terminal Value (Multiple) = $562.81M * 10.0 = **$5,628.10M**

The revised Gordon Growth calculation now implies an exit multiple of $4,771.60M / $562.81M = **8.5x**. This is far more reasonable than the previous 6.3x and is within the historical range for the industry. To be conservative, we will use the **Gordon Growth Terminal Value of $4,771.60M** as our primary method, as it is grounded in cash flow fundamentals.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value:**
*   PV of Explicit FCFF = $275.92/(1.1169)^1 + $294.63/(1.1169)^2 + $311.70/(1.1169)^3 + $326.54/(1.1169)^4 + $338.90/(1.1169)^5 = $247 + $236 + $224 + $210 + $195 = **$1,112M**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $4,771.60M / (1.1169)^5 = **$2,747M**
*   **Total Enterprise Value = $1,112M + $2,747M = $3,859M**

**20) Equity Value:**
*   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
*   Net Debt = Total Debt ($565.7M) - Cash ($81.1M) = $484.6M
*   **Equity Value = $3,859M - $484.6M = $3,374.4M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   Projected Year 5 Shares = 43.85M * (1 - 0.008)^5 = 42.12M shares
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $3,374.4M / 42.12M shares = $80.11**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $80.11:** Assumes 8% revenue growth tapering to 4%, with margins gently compressing to 19.7%.
*   **Low/Bear Case: $64:** Assumes slower revenue growth (e.g., 5% tapering to 2%) and margin compression to 18.0% due to a construction downturn.
*   **High/Bull Case: $98:** Assumes stronger revenue growth (e.g., 10% tapering to 5%) and stable 20.1% margins from successful pricing and product mix strategies.

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   MOS Price (30% discount) = $80.11 * (1 - 0.30) = **$56.08**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Cyclicality of Construction:** The company's performance is heavily tied to the health of the commercial and residential construction markets, which are sensitive to interest rates and economic cycles.
2.  **Input Cost Volatility:** Raw material and energy costs can be volatile, potentially compressing margins if price increases cannot be passed on to customers.
3.  **Competition:** The building products industry is competitive. Failure to innovate or maintain brand strength could lead to market share loss.

final answer is 80.11 $
