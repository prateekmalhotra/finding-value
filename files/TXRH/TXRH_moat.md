### 1) Network Effects (18%)
**Reasoning:** Texas Roadhouse's business model as a restaurant chain does not create network effects. The value of visiting a Texas Roadhouse is not dependent on the number of other users or locations. Each restaurant operates as a standalone destination for customers.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as a restaurant company operating in the casual dining segment. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Growth is driven by opening new restaurants and increasing sales at existing locations, not by user-to-user interactions. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs (15%)
**Reasoning:** There are no significant switching costs for customers. Diners can easily choose to eat at a competitor's restaurant with no financial or data-related lock-in. The restaurant industry is characterized by intense competition and low customer switching costs.
**Evidence:**
*   The company competes with a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and independent operators on the basis of taste, quality, price, and overall dining experience. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership (15%)
**Reasoning:** Texas Roadhouse demonstrates a cost advantage through its efficient operational model, focus on a limited menu of high-volume items, and strong supplier relationships. The company's emphasis on value, with large portions at moderate prices, suggests an ability to manage costs effectively below competitors while maintaining quality. The "owner-operator partnership model" for restaurant managers incentivizes cost control and profitability at the unit level.
**Evidence:**
*   The company negotiates directly with suppliers for substantially all food and beverage products to maximize quality and obtain competitive prices. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The operating strategy is built on offering everyday value with attractive price points and generous portions, suggesting a lean cost structure. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Restaurant margin as a percentage of total sales was 17.1% in Q2 2025.
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP (12%)
**Reasoning:** Texas Roadhouse has built a strong, recognizable brand associated with value, quality steaks, and a lively atmosphere. This brand strength allows them to attract and retain a loyal customer base without relying on national advertising, instead focusing on local marketing and word-of-mouth. The company actively protects its trademarks, such as "Texas Roadhouse," "Legendary Food, Legendary Service," and "Cactus Blossom."
**Evidence:**
*   The company has registered significant domestic marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office and has registrations pending in multiple foreign jurisdictions. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The marketing strategy relies on local, community-based initiatives rather than national advertising, indicating strong brand pull. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company has successfully licensed its brand for retail products like steak sauces and seasonings, further demonstrating brand value. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale (10%)
**Reasoning:** With 784 system-wide restaurants as of December 31, 2024, Texas Roadhouse has achieved a significant national footprint that creates economies of scale in purchasing and supply chain management. This scale makes it difficult for new entrants to compete on price. The company's strategy of clustering restaurants in certain regions enhances distribution efficiency and brand awareness.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, there are 784 restaurants in 49 states and ten foreign countries. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company utilizes a national distribution company for most food products, leveraging its scale for efficiency. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Approximately 21% of company restaurants are concentrated in Texas and Florida, indicating a dense network in key states. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage (10%)
**Reasoning:** While Texas Roadhouse collects customer data through its loyalty programs, online ordering, and waitlist app, there is little evidence that this data provides a significant, durable competitive advantage. The data is primarily used for targeted marketing and improving operational efficiency (like managing wait times), rather than creating a proprietary feedback loop that fundamentally improves the core product in a way competitors cannot replicate.
**Evidence:**
*   The company uses a permission-based email loyalty program and digital marketing to engage with guests. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Digital enhancements like online ordering and waitlist management have been implemented to improve the guest experience and handle increased volumes. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects (8%)
**Reasoning:** Texas Roadhouse operates a traditional restaurant model and does not have a business ecosystem or platform that integrates third-party products or services. Its value proposition is self-contained within its own restaurants.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business is centered on its three restaurant concepts: Texas Roadhouse, Bubba's 33, and Jaggers. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   There is no evidence of a third-party developer ecosystem, app marketplace, or integrated partner services that would indicate platform effects.
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers (6%)
**Reasoning:** The primary regulatory barriers in the restaurant industry are liquor licenses and food safety permits. While obtaining these licenses requires effort and compliance, they do not represent a significant long-term barrier to entry for well-capitalized competitors. These are standard operating requirements for the industry rather than a unique competitive advantage for Texas Roadhouse.
**Evidence:**
*   Each restaurant is subject to permitting and licensing requirements, including alcoholic beverage control, health, and sanitation. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Liquor licenses must be renewed annually and can be revoked, indicating they are not a permanent, insurmountable barrier. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity (4%)
**Reasoning:** Opening a new full-service casual dining restaurant requires significant capital investment, creating a moderate barrier to entry. The company's average capital investment for a new Texas Roadhouse restaurant in 2025 is estimated to be approximately USD 8.6 million. These assets (buildings, kitchen equipment) are specific to the restaurant industry and cannot be easily repurposed, representing a sunk cost for potential competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   The average capital investment for a new Texas Roadhouse restaurant to be opened in 2025 is expected to be approximately USD 8.6 million. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company's prototypical restaurant is a freestanding building of approximately 8,000 square feet, representing a substantial, specific asset. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility (2%)
**Reasoning:** As a restaurant, Texas Roadhouse has virtually no recurring revenue or long-term customer contracts. Revenue is transactional and dependent on daily customer traffic and spending. Therefore, revenue visibility is low and must be earned continuously.
**Evidence:**
*   Revenue is generated from per-visit sales of food and beverages at company-owned restaurants and franchise royalties based on a percentage of sales. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### Aggregation
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (0 * 0.18) + (0 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 0 + 0 + 0.6 + 0.48 + 0.3 + 0.1 + 0 + 0.06 + 0.12 + 0 = 1.66
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 66.6 / 100

### Mapping
*   A weighted score of 66.6 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range, which maps to a moat rating of 3.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is approximately 8-12 years. This is based on the durability of the company's brand and its cost advantages derived from scale and operational efficiency. The brand is well-established and has been cultivated over decades, making it difficult for competitors to replicate quickly. The cost advantages are tied to the large and growing store base, which provides leverage over suppliers. These advantages are not indefinite, as shifts in consumer dining preferences and persistent cost inflation could erode them over the long term.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Sustained Commodity Inflation:** A long-term, significant increase in beef prices, which constitute a major portion of food costs, could force the company to either raise prices—damaging its value proposition—or absorb the costs, shrinking margins. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
2.  **Shift in Consumer Preferences:** A significant consumer shift away from red meat and traditional American casual dining towards healthier or more diverse culinary options could reduce customer traffic and render the brand less relevant. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
3.  **Operational Mismanagement:** A failure to maintain high standards of food quality and service, or an inability to retain key "managing partners" who are central to the company's culture and operational execution, could quickly damage the brand and customer loyalty. (Texas Roadhouse, Inc. 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Restaurant Margin %:** A consistent decline would indicate an erosion of cost advantages.
2.  **Comparable Restaurant Sales (Traffic vs. Check):** A sustained decline in customer traffic, even if masked by price increases, would be a strong negative signal.
3.  **Average Unit Volume (AUV):** Stagnation or decline in AUV for new and existing stores could indicate market saturation or declining brand appeal.
4.  **Food & Beverage Costs as % of Sales:** A consistent increase suggests a loss of purchasing power or inability to manage costs.
5.  **Employee Turnover (especially Managing Partners):** High turnover in key management roles would threaten operational consistency and the company's culture.
6.  **Customer Satisfaction/Guest Survey Scores:** A decline would be a leading indicator of problems with service or food quality.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Texas Roadhouse possesses a moderate economic moat, justifying a 3/5 rating. The company's primary advantages stem from its strong, value-oriented brand and significant cost efficiencies derived from operational scale and a culture of cost-consciousness. These factors have allowed it to consistently deliver strong financial results and maintain customer loyalty in a highly competitive industry. However, the moat is not wide; the company has no network effects or switching costs, and its advantages could be eroded by sustained inflation or a major shift in consumer dining habits. A downgrade would be warranted if restaurant-level margins consistently decline or if the company loses its ability to drive positive customer traffic growth.

moat rating is 3 / 5
