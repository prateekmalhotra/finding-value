### **One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include: (1) **Competition:** The fitness industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry for low-cost models, which could pressure membership growth and pricing power. (2) **Economic Sensitivity:** As a consumer discretionary service, membership growth is sensitive to economic downturns, job losses, and declines in disposable income, which could reduce same-store sales and franchisee health. (3) **Franchisee Health:** The company's growth is heavily dependent on the financial health and expansion appetite of its franchisees; any deterioration in their unit economics could slow system growth. (4) **Execution Risk:** The company's ability to meet its growth targets depends on successful site selection, managing development costs, and maintaining brand standards across a growing network of stores.
