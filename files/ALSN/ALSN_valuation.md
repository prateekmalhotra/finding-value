*   **Net Sales:** "between $3,075 million and $3,175 million".

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** We use the midpoint of management's revenue guidance, which is **$3,125 million** (($3,075M + $3,175M) / 2). This represents a slight decline from TTM revenue, consistent with management commentary.
    *   **Years 2-5:** We project a conservative **2.5% annual growth rate**. This reflects a blend of potential market cyclicality and long-term inflation expectations, a realistic rate for a mature industrial company.

*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating (EBIT) Margin:** We assume a stable **31.0% EBIT margin** throughout the forecast period. This is slightly below the TTM margin of 32.25% but above the three-year average, reflecting management's ability to maintain profitability despite market softness.

*   **Taxes:**
    *   The effective tax rate is assumed to be **21.0%**. This is a normalization from the TTM rate of 18.4% to reflect a more standard U.S. corporate tax rate, removing potential one-time benefits.

*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** For Year 1, we use the midpoint of guidance, **$170 million**. For Years 2-5, we model capex at **5.5% of revenue**, consistent with the guided intensity for 2025 ($170M / $3,125M = 5.4%).
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled at **10.0% of the year-over-year change in revenue**, a standard assumption for changes in operational assets and liabilities needed to support growth.
    *   **D&A and SBC:** Depreciation & Amortization is held at **3.75% of revenue**, and Stock-Based Compensation is held at **0.8% of revenue**, both in line with TTM levels.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

*   **FCFF Formula:**
    `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

*   **FCFF Forecast (USD Millions):**

| Fiscal Year | 2025 (Y1) | 2026 (Y2) | 2027 (Y3) | 2028 (Y4) | 2029 (Y5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,125 | $3,203 | $3,283 | $3,365 | $3,449 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *-2.3%* | *2.5%* | *2.5%* | *2.5%* | *2.5%* |
| EBIT (31.0%) | $969 | $993 | $1,018 | $1,043 | $1,069 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-0.21)) | $765 | $784 | $804 | $824 | $845 |
| (+) D&A (3.75% of Rev) | $117 | $120 | $123 | $126 | $129 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp (0.8% of Rev) | ($25) | ($26) | ($26) | ($27) | ($28) |
| (-) Capex | ($170) | ($176) | ($181) | ($185) | ($190) |
| (-) Change in WC (10% of ΔRev) | $8 | ($8) | ($8) | ($8) | ($8) |
| **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** | **$695** | **$695** | **$713** | **$730** | **$748** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.30%** (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Beta (β):** **1.12** (Source: TradingView). This reflects slightly higher volatility than the overall market, which is reasonable for a cyclical industrial firm.
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%** (a standard market assumption).
    *   **Calculation:** `4.30% + 1.12 * 5.0% = 9.90%`

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** `(Interest Expense / Total Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate)`
    *   **Calculation:** `($85M / $2,418M) * (1 - 0.21) = 2.77%`

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt`
    *   **Market Cap (E):** $7,691M ($88.40/share * 87M shares).
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $2,418M.
    *   **Total Value (V):** $10,109M.
    *   **Calculation:** `($7,691 / $10,109) * 9.90% + ($2,418 / $10,109) * 2.77% = 7.53% + 0.66% =` **8.19%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = (FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This is capped at the long-run inflation expectation and represents mature, stable growth.
    *   **Calculation:** `($748M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0819 - 0.025) = $767M / 0.0569 =` **$13,475 million**.

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** `EBIT_Y5 ($1,069M) + D&A_Y5 ($129M) = $1,198M`.
    *   **Exit Multiple:** **8.5x**. This is a conservative multiple in line with the company's current trading range and historical averages for industrial cyclicals.
    *   **Terminal Value (EV/EBITDA):** `$1,198M * 8.5 =` **$10,183 million**.

*   **Conclusion:** The Exit Multiple method yields a significantly lower value, suggesting the Gordon Growth model may be too optimistic. As per instructions, we select the lower, more conservative Terminal Value of **$10,183 million**.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Present Value of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   PV = `(695/1.0819^1) + (695/1.0819^2) + (713/1.0819^3) + (730/1.0819^4) + (748/1.0819^5)`
    *   PV = `$642 + $594 + $563 + $534 + $505 =` **$2,838 million**
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:**
    *   PV = `$10,183 / (1.0819^5) =` **$6,869 million**
*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `EV = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value`
    *   **Calculation:** `$2,838M + $6,869M =` **$9,707 million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   **Net Debt:** `$2,418M (Total Debt) - $778M (Cash) = $1,640 million`.
    *   **Calculation:** `$9,707M - $1,640M =` **$8,067 million**

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Weighted-Average Shares`
    *   **Calculation:** `$8,067M / 87M shares =` **$92.72 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$92.72**. Assumes 2.5% growth and 31% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$74.50**. Assumes a more pessimistic scenario with only 1.5% long-term growth and margin compression to 29% due to competition and integration challenges.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$112.00**. Assumes a more optimistic scenario with 3.5% long-term growth and slight margin expansion to 32% from successful cost controls and new product adoption.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount is applied to the Base-Case Fair Value to establish a price that provides a significant buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price:** `$92.72 * (1 - 0.30) =` **$64.90**

### **Risk Notes**
The base-case valuation is subject to several key risks. First, the company's heavy reliance on the North American On-Highway market makes it vulnerable to cyclical downturns in commercial vehicle demand, as noted in recent management commentary. Second, the pending acquisition of Dana's Off-Highway business, while strategic, introduces significant integration risk and could disrupt operational efficiency and pressure margins in the near term. Finally, the transition to electric vehicles (EVs) in the commercial space represents a long-term existential threat that could disrupt demand for traditional transmissions faster than anticipated.

final answer is 92.72 $
