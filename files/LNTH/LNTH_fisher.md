Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Lantheus Holdings, Inc. Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, filed February 26, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lantheus's key product, PYLARIFY, an imaging agent for prostate cancer, has a strong growth runway.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lantheus is actively expanding its pipeline through acquisitions and partnerships to become a fully integrated radiopharmaceutical company. In 2024 and early 2025, the company acquired or announced agreements to acquire Life Molecular Imaging (Alzheimer's diagnostics), Evergreen Theragnostics (manufacturing capabilities), and NAV-4694 (another Alzheimer's imaging agent). It also has ongoing development for PNT2002 (mCRPC therapy) and PNT2003 (neuroendocrine tumor therapy), among others. Research and development expenses increased 116.3% to $168.1 million in 2024, reflecting significant investment in this pipeline.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** R&D spending was approximately 11.0% of revenue in 2024 ($168.1 million in R&D vs. $1.53 billion in revenue). This investment supports a broad pipeline, including late-stage assets like MK-6240 and NAV-4694 for Alzheimer's disease, and PNT2002 for prostate cancer therapy. The company has successfully brought PYLARIFY from development to a blockbuster product and is leveraging partnerships, such as with POINT Biopharma, to advance its therapeutic pipeline. The pending acquisitions of Life Molecular and Evergreen would further enhance its R&D and clinical development capabilities.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated strong commercial execution. PYLARIFY sales grew 24.3% to $1.06 billion and DEFINITY sales grew 13.6% to $317.8 million in 2024, indicating effective market penetration and sales efforts. For PYLARIFY, Lantheus utilizes a dedicated internal sales team and leverages sales teams at its PMF (PET manufacturing facilities) partners to achieve broad national distribution with customers in 48 states. For DEFINITY, the company estimates it holds over 80% market share in the U.S. for ultrasound enhancing agents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lantheus has strong profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross profit margin of 64.4% ($988.3 million gross profit on $1.53 billion revenue) and an operating profit margin of 29.8% ($457.0 million operating income). This represents a significant improvement from a gross margin of 54.7% and operating margin of 28.1% in the prior year.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is taking steps to protect and enhance its margins. Lantheus established its own in-house manufacturing facility for DEFINITY, which it believes "provides supply chain redundancy, improved flexibility and reduced costs in a potentially more price competitive environment." Additionally, the strong sales growth of the high-margin product PYLARIFY contributes positively to the overall margin profile. The company's strategic acquisitions, such as Evergreen Theragnostics, are intended to enhance manufacturing capabilities, which can lead to better cost control for future therapeutic products.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K reports that as of December 31, 2024, it had 808 employees, none of whom are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. The company states, "we believe that our relationship with our employees is good." The "Human Capital Management" section details initiatives around diversity, inclusion, ethics, and employee engagement, including the sponsorship of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and various employee recognition programs. There is no evidence of significant labor disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lantheus executed a planned leadership transition on March 1, 2024, where Brian Markison became CEO and former CEO Mary Anne Heino became Chair of the Board of Directors, suggesting a stable and orderly succession process. The board includes a Lead Independent Director. This structured transition points to a healthy and well-governed relationship between the board and executive management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's disclosure highlights a strategic evolution into a "fully integrated, radiopharmaceutical company," a complex undertaking that requires a skilled management team. The successful execution of multiple strategic transactions in 2024 and early 2025 (acquisitions of Meilleur, pending acquisitions of Life Molecular and Evergreen, and strategic agreements with Perspective Therapeutics) demonstrates significant management capability in business development, finance, and integration. The company has been able to manage rapid growth and expansion of its product pipeline effectively.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The "Controls and Procedures" section of the 10-K states that management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There is no mention of material weaknesses or restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the radiopharmaceutical industry is the manufacturing and distribution network for short-lived isotopes. Lantheus has established a robust network of 62 PET Manufacturing Facilities (PMFs) for PYLARIFY, which is critical for the reliable, just-in-time delivery of the F-18 based agent. This diverse supply network provides "geographic breadth, out-the-door time flexibility and added optionality," creating a significant barrier to entry for competitors. Furthermore, the company's planned acquisition of Evergreen Theragnostics is a strategic move to vertically integrate and strengthen its manufacturing capabilities for therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is clearly focused on long-term growth through significant reinvestment. R&D expenses more than doubled to $168.1 million in 2024, and the company has committed hundreds of millions in upfront payments for acquisitions and partnerships (e.g., pending Life Molecular and Evergreen acquisitions, Perspective agreements). These investments are aimed at building a durable, integrated radiopharmaceutical company with a diversified pipeline in oncology and neurology, demonstrating a willingness to sacrifice some short-term profit for a much larger long-term market position.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company appears to be in a strong financial position. As of December 31, 2024, Lantheus had $912.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. It generated $544.8 million in cash from operating activities in 2024. While it has significant potential milestone payments related to its acquisitions, its strong cash flow and access to a $750 million revolving credit facility suggest it can fund its growth initiatives without significant dilutive equity financing. In fact, the company repurchased $100 million of its own stock in 2024, demonstrating financial strength.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While specific earnings call transcripts for 2025 could not be accessed to fully evaluate management's real-time communication style, the company's 2024 10-K provides extensive and clear disclosure on a wide range of topics, including competitive risks, regulatory challenges, and details of its strategic transactions. For example, the filing openly discusses the PNT2002 clinical trial data, noting that interim overall survival (OS) results were "immature" and the hazard ratio was "confounded by the overwhelming number of patients who crossed over," which is a transparent discussion of a complex clinical result. The document also clearly outlines risks, such as the competition PYLARIFY faces and the impact of reimbursement changes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025), ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LNTH/transcripts/'] (Accessed August 22, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's 2024 10-K, specifically the "Legal Proceedings" and "Risk Factors" sections, reveals no significant red flags suggesting a lack of integrity. The company discloses patent litigation, which is common in the pharmaceutical industry, but there are no mentions of major regulatory actions, accounting scandals, or shareholder lawsuits related to governance or integrity. The company has a formal Code of Conduct and Ethics and an Ethics and Compliance Committee.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1521036/000162828025007970/lnth-20241231.htm'] (February 26, 2025)

---
**Synthesis**

Lantheus Holdings scores perfectly on this Fisher analysis, presenting as a company with strong fundamentals and a clear, aggressive strategy for long-term growth. Its primary strengths lie in its dominant market position with PYLARIFY and DEFINITY, which continue to exhibit strong growth and generate substantial cash flow. Management has demonstrated a clear commitment to reinvesting this cash into building a fully-integrated radiopharmaceutical company, with a focus on the high-potential oncology and neurology markets. The company's robust manufacturing and distribution network for radiopharmaceuticals serves as a significant competitive moat. The financial position is excellent, with high margins, strong cash flow, and a solid balance sheet that mitigates the risk of shareholder dilution.

The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on three key variables. First, the successful integration of the pending Life Molecular and Evergreen acquisitions is critical; any stumbles could impact financials and operational efficiency. Second, the clinical trial outcomes and subsequent regulatory decisions for its late-stage pipeline assets, particularly PNT2002 in prostate cancer therapy and its Alzheimer's diagnostics (MK-6240, NAV-4694), will be transformative. A negative outcome on a major trial could easily flip the "R&D Effectiveness" score to No. Finally, the competitive landscape for PYLARIFY is intensifying, and any significant loss of market share could impact the "Long Runway" and "Profit Margins" assessments.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
