GoPro, Inc. (GPRO) Fisher Analysis
Date of analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary sources reviewed: Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (August 11, 2025), SEC Filings (10-K for FY2024, 10-Q for Q1 & Q2 2025), and various news/analytical articles.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro is attempting to expand its market beyond action cameras into software and services. The subscription and service revenue has been a bright spot, growing 8% year-over-year in Q2 2024. However, the core hardware business faces significant headwinds from market saturation and increasing competition from smartphones. While the company is launching new products, including an entry-level camera and a tech-enabled motorcycle helmet, it's unclear if these will be enough to offset the decline in the core market and drive a *sizable* increase in sales for several years.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's management has explicitly stated its focus on launching a "diversified suite of hardware and software products in the second half of 2025 and throughout 2026." This includes new cameras and entering new product categories. They are also investing in software, with ongoing enhancements and a new program for subscribers to monetize their content by training AI models.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's R&D spending has been significant, reaching $167.75 million in fiscal year 2024. However, the effectiveness of this spending is questionable. The company has had notable product failures in the past, such as the Karma drone, which cost the company $376 million. While they continue to release new cameras, the innovation has been incremental rather than groundbreaking, and they have struggled to diversify their product line successfully.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro utilizes a dual-channel sales approach, with 73% of revenue from its retail channel and 27% from its direct-to-consumer website, GoPro.com. The direct channel, which includes subscription and service revenue, is a key area of focus. The subscription attach rate has improved to 56%, a 24% increase from the previous year. However, overall revenue has been declining, indicating that the sales organization is struggling to overcome market challenges.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Q2 2025, GoPro's gross margin improved to 36% from 30.7% in the prior year. However, the company is still not profitable, with an adjusted EBITDA of negative $6 million in the same quarter. While the margin improvement is a positive sign, the lack of overall profitability indicates that the current margins are not sufficient to support the business.
**Answer:** No

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's management is actively working to improve margins. The recent improvement in gross margin was attributed to "less price discounting activity." Additionally, the company is focused on reducing operating expenses, with a 32% reduction year-over-year in Q2 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro has received recognition as a "Best Place to Work" and has a flexible remote work policy that appears popular with employees. Internal surveys show an 18% increase in employee engagement since 2019. This suggests a positive work environment and good labor relations.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, led by founder and CEO Nicholas Woodman, appears stable. There is no public information to suggest significant infighting or instability at the executive level. The company's proxy statements will provide more detail on executive compensation and board structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000162828025013046/gpro-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000162828025013046/gpro-20241231.htm) (10-K for FY2024, filed February 2025).

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations page and SEC filings list a full executive team beyond the CEO, including a CFO & COO, and other key positions. However, the company's performance in recent years raises questions about the overall effectiveness and depth of the management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://investor.gopro.com/](https://investor.gopro.com/) (GoPro Investor Relations), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000162828025013046/gpro-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000162828025013046/gpro-20241231.htm) (10-K for FY2024, filed February 2025).

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's financial statements are audited by a reputable firm, and there have been no recent reports of significant accounting issues or restatements. The company provides segment information in its filings, which offers some transparency into its operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000162828025013046/gpro-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1500435/000162828025013046/gpro-20241231.htm) (10-K for FY2024, filed February 2025).

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's key competitive advantages are its brand recognition and the ecosystem it has built around its products, including its software and subscription services. However, the rise of high-quality smartphone cameras is a major threat, and the company has yet to demonstrate a sustainable competitive advantage beyond its niche market.
**Answer:** No

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's focus on building its subscription business and diversifying its product line suggests a long-range outlook. The company is investing in R&D and new product categories, which may not pay off in the short term but could lead to long-term growth. However, given the company's current financial situation, there is also significant pressure to achieve profitability in the near term.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro recently raised $50 million in debt financing to bolster its balance sheet. However, the company has a history of losses and a significant amount of convertible debt due. While the recent financing provides some breathing room, the company's ability to fund its growth without further equity financing is not certain.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
GoPro's strongest positives are its brand recognition, its efforts to build a subscription-based ecosystem, and its positive employee relations. However, the company faces significant challenges, including a maturing core market, intense competition, and a history of unprofitable growth. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its new product launches and its ability to achieve sustained profitability. To flip a "No" to a "Yes," GoPro would need to demonstrate a significant and sustainable increase in revenue and profitability, driven by its new products and services. The company's future success hinges on its ability to innovate beyond its core camera business and create a more diversified and profitable business model.
