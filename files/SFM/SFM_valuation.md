This is a comprehensive and well-structured intrinsic valuation. The analyst has demonstrated a good understanding of DCF methodology and has made reasonable assumptions, clearly justifying them. The reverse DCF provides valuable context by highlighting the market's aggressive growth expectations.

Here's a detailed review, highlighting the strengths and identifying minor areas for improvement, primarily concerning clarity and precision in calculations:

### **Strengths:**
1.  **Clear Structure and Justification:** The valuation follows a logical flow, with each assumption clearly stated and backed by rationale and sources.
2.  **Reverse DCF Inclusion:** Starting with a reverse DCF is excellent practice, providing a critical benchmark for the analyst's own assumptions against market expectations.
3.  **Conservative Approach:** The analyst consistently opts for conservative assumptions (e.g., lower growth than market-implied, 0% change in working capital, slightly higher tax rate, slightly higher SBC, more conservative share reduction).
4.  **Detailed WACC Calculation:** The WACC calculation is thorough, with appropriate methods for cost of equity and cost of debt. The adjustment for the artificially low historical interest expense for Kd is a good move.
5.  **Terminal Value Cross-Check:** Using both the Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple methods, and then choosing the more appropriate one, demonstrates a robust approach.
6.  **Risk Notes:** The inclusion of specific risk factors is very helpful for a complete picture.

### **Areas for Improvement / Minor Issues & Proposed Fixes:**

1.  **Clarity on D&A Assumption:**
    *   **Issue:** While Capex is explicitly stated as a percentage of revenue in the "Capital Intensity" section (10), D&A is only mentioned in the LTM financials and then implicitly applied in the FCFF table as "3.4% of Rev." For consistency and clarity, D&A should have its own explicit assumption statement in the narrative section.
    *   **Fix:** Add a dedicated D&A assumption under section 10, similar to Capex. (See corrected output below).

2.  **Rounding Precision:**
    *   **Issue:** Several calculations exhibit minor rounding differences (e.g., PV of FCFFs, Enterprise Value, Equity Value, Gordon Growth Terminal Value, Per-Share Value). While not fundamentally altering the conclusion, maintaining greater precision throughout would make the model more robust and reproducible.
    *   **Fix:** Recalculate these values with slightly more decimal places to ensure accuracy.

3.  **Terminal Value (Gordon Growth Method):**
    *   **Issue:** The calculation of the Gordon Growth Terminal Value ($12,301M) leads to an implied exit multiple of 8.8x. However, using the precise FCFF_Y5 of $678M, g=2.5%, and WACC=8.14%, the calculation is ($678 * 1.025) / (0.0814 - 0.025) = $694.95 / 0.0564 = $12,321.81M. This is a minor difference, but worth correcting for consistency.
    *   **Fix:** Update the Gordon Growth calculation result.

### **Corrected and Refined Valuation:**

### **PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

**1) Current Market Price**
First, I will get the latest stock price for SFM.
The current market price for SFM is **$148.35** as of August 22, 2025.

**2) Baseline Financials (LTM)**
To establish the baseline, I will retrieve the last twelve months (LTM) of financial data by browsing the quarterly financials and balance sheet.

| Financial Metric | LTM (ended Jun 29, 2025) | Source & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $8,399 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Gross Margin** | 38.93% | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Operating Income (EBIT)** | $635 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Net Income** | $485 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Depreciation & Amortization (D&A)** | $287 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC)** | $30 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Capital Expenditures (Capex)** | $242 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Change in Working Capital** | -$77 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Interest Expense** | $2 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Cash & Equivalents** | $261 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Total Debt** | $1,756 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Diluted Weighted-Average Shares** | 100.19 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

**3 & 4) Solving for Market-Implied Growth**
To reverse-engineer the assumptions in the $148.35 share price, I will use a simplified DCF model. I will hold the LTM operating margin of 7.56% constant and solve for the 5-year revenue growth rate the market is pricing in.

*   **Market Capitalization:** $148.35/share * 100.19M shares = $14,863M
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $14,863M (Market Cap) + $1,756M (Total Debt) - $261M (Cash) = $16,358M
*   **Preliminary WACC (for this exercise):** Assuming a WACC of 7.0% (detailed in Part 2).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

After iterating to match the current Enterprise Value of $16,358M, the model requires a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 14.5%**.

**5) Market-Implied Thesis**
To justify the current stock price of $148.35, an investor must believe Sprouts Farmers Market can grow its revenue at a compounded rate of **14.5% annually for the next five years**, while maintaining its current LTM operating margin of **7.56%**. This growth would need to be followed by a perpetual 2.5% growth rate thereafter.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (CONSERVATIVE BASE-CASE)**

This section builds a valuation from the ground up using conservative, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6 & 7) Revenue for Years 1â€“5**
The market's implied 14.5% growth is significantly higher than the company's recent history. The revenue growth for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 was 6.8%, 5.0%, and -5.7% respectively. Management's strategy focuses on smaller, more efficient stores. I will search for management guidance.
Management has guided for 10.5% to 12.5% net sales growth for the full year 2025, driven by 35 new store openings and comparable store sales growth of 4.5% to 6.5%. (Nasdaq, Mar 14, 2025). This is a significant acceleration.
*   **Rationale:** I will use a growth rate that starts at the low end of management's 2025 guidance and then tapers down to a more sustainable long-term rate. This is more conservative than the market's implied 14.5% but reflects management's stated plans.
*   **Assumption:** Revenue growth of **11.0%** in Year 1, tapering by 1.5% annually to **5.0%** in Year 5.

**8) Margin Path**
*   **Rationale:** The LTM operating margin is 7.56%. Management has several initiatives, like supply chain optimization and private label expansion (now 23% of sales), which are expected to support margins. (Nasdaq, Mar 14, 2025). I will assume a modest, slow expansion toward 8.0% over the forecast period, which is more conservative than assuming the current peak holds.
*   **Assumption:** Operating margin starts at **7.6%** in Year 1 and expands by 10 bps annually to **8.0%** by Year 5.

**9) Taxes**
*   **Rationale:** The LTM effective tax rate was 24.1%. The average over the last three fiscal years (2024, 2023, 2022) has been consistently around 25%. I will use the slightly higher, more conservative historical average.
*   **Assumption:** Effective tax rate of **25.0%** for the forecast period.

**10) Capital Intensity**
*   **Capex Rationale:** LTM Capex was $242M, or 2.9% of revenue. Management plans to accelerate store openings, so I expect this to be higher than the historical average. I will model Capex as a percentage of revenue, assuming an elevated rate for new store builds.
*   **Capex Assumption:** Capex at **3.5%** of annual revenue.
*   **D&A Rationale:** LTM D&A was $287M, or 3.4% of revenue ($287M / $8,399M = 3.42%). Given the focus on new store openings, D&A is expected to grow in line with revenue. I will keep it consistent with the LTM ratio.
*   **D&A Assumption:** D&A at **3.4%** of annual revenue.
*   **Working Capital Rationale:** LTM change in working capital was -$77M. Historically, it has been volatile. I will model it based on incremental revenue. The 3-year average change in WC as a % of change in revenue is approximately -1.0%. I will assume a conservative 0% to avoid forecasting a cash source.
*   **Working Capital Assumption:** Change in WC is **0.0%** of the change in revenue.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks**
*   **SBC Rationale:** Stock-Based Compensation is a real expense and will be subtracted from FCFF. The LTM figure is $30M, or 0.35% of revenue. I will keep this stable as a percentage of revenue.
*   **SBC Assumption:** SBC remains constant at **0.4%** of revenue.
*   **Share Count Rationale:** The company has an active share repurchase program. The diluted share count has decreased from 109M in FY2022 to 100M LTM. This is a reduction of ~4% per year. I will assume a more conservative net reduction going forward.
*   **Share Count Assumption:** A net annual reduction in diluted shares of **2.0%**.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Formula**
FCFF is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
*Formula: FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation*

**FCFF Forecast (USD Millions):**
| Year | 2026 (Y1) | 2027 (Y2) | 2028 (Y3) | 2029 (Y4) | 2030 (Y5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 11.0% | 9.5% | 8.0% | 6.5% | 5.0% |
| **Revenue** | **$9,323** | **$10,209** | **$11,025** | **$11,742** | **$12,329** |
| EBIT Margin | 7.6% | 7.7% | 7.8% | 7.9% | 8.0% |
| **EBIT** | **$709** | **$786** | **$860** | **$928** | **$986** |
| Tax Rate | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% | 25.0% |
| **NOPAT** | **$531** | **$590** | **$645** | **$696** | **$740** |
| **(+) D&A (3.4% of Rev)** | $317 | $347 | $375 | $399 | $419 |
| **(-) Capex (3.5% of Rev)** | -$326 | -$357 | -$386 | -$411 | -$432 |
| **(-) Change in WC** | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **(-) SBC (0.4% of Rev)** | -$37 | -$41 | -$44 | -$47 | -$49 |
| **Free Cash Flow to Firm** | **$485** | **$539** | **$590** | **$637** | **$678** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM)**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. This is a standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
*   **Beta:** I will search for the 5-year monthly beta for SFM.
The Beta (5Y Monthly) is 0.87 (Yahoo Finance, August 22, 2025). This is below 1.0, suggesting lower volatility than the broader market, which is reasonable for a grocery retailer.
*   **Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.25% + 0.87 * 5.0% = 8.60%**

**15) Cost of Debt**
*   **Calculation:** Interest Expense / Total Debt = $2M / $1,756M = 0.11%. This is artificially low. A better method is to use the effective rate on its debt facilities. A conservative estimate, given the current rate environment, would be to use the risk-free rate plus a credit spread. I'll assume a spread of 1.5%.
*   **Cost of Debt (Kd) = 4.25% + 1.5% = 5.75%**
*   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.75% * (1 - 25.0%) = 4.31%**

**16) Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**
*   **Market Value of Equity (E):** $14,863M
*   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $1,756M
*   **Total Capital (V) = E + D:** $16,619M
*   **WACC = (E/V) * Ke + (D/V) * Kd * (1 - t)**
*   **WACC = ($14,863/$16,619) * 8.60% + ($1,756/$16,619) * 4.31% = 8.14%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Gordon Growth Method**
*   **Long-Run Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a realistic assumption for long-term nominal growth, in line with expected inflation.
*   **Terminal Value = (FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
*   **Terminal Value = ($678 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0814 - 0.025) = $694.95 / 0.0564 = $12,321.81M**

**18) Exit Multiple Cross-Check**
*   **Year 5 EBITDA Calculation:** EBIT_Y5 ($986M) + D&A_Y5 ($419M) = $1,405M
*   **Historical Multiple:** A conservative historical/sector median EV/EBITDA multiple for a stable grocer is around 8.0x-10.0x. I will use **10.0x**.
*   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $1,405M * 10.0 = $14,050M**

The Gordon Growth method implies an exit multiple of **$12,321.81M / $1,405M = 8.77x**, which is a reasonable and realistic multiple. The 10x multiple from the cross-check yields a higher value. I will proceed with the more realistic value derived from the exit multiple method as it reflects a standard industry valuation benchmark. **Chosen Terminal Value: $14,050M.**

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19 & 20) Enterprise Value and Equity Value**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   Y1: $485 / (1.0814)^1 = $448.51
    *   Y2: $539 / (1.0814)^2 = $460.10
    *   Y3: $590 / (1.0814)^3 = $467.43
    *   Y4: $637 / (1.0814)^4 = $466.42
    *   Y5: $678 / (1.0814)^5 = $456.09
    *   **Total PV of Explicit FCFF = $2,298.55M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $14,050M / (1.0814^5) = **$9,461.34M**
*   **Enterprise Value = $2,298.55M + $9,461.34M = $11,759.89M**
*   **Equity Value = $11,759.89M (Enterprise Value) - $1,756M (Total Debt) + $261M (Cash) = $10,264.89M**
    *   *Debt and Cash cited from LTM Baseline Financials table above.*

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**
*   **Initial Diluted Shares:** 100.19M
*   **Projected Y5 Diluted Shares (2.0% annual reduction):** 100.19M * (1 - 0.02)^5 = 90.570M shares
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $10,264.89M / 90.570M shares = $113.33**

**22) Valuation Range**
*   **Base Case: $113.33.** (Assumes 11% revenue growth tapering to 5%, margins expanding to 8.0%).
*   **Low/Bear Case: $85.** (Assumes slower 7% growth tapering to 3%, margins stable at 7.5%).
*   **High/Bull Case: $145.** (Assumes 13% growth tapering to 6% as guided, margins expanding to 8.5% on efficiency gains).

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**
*   **MOS Price (30% below Base Case) = $113.33 * (1 - 0.30) = $79.33**

---

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Competitive Intensity:** The grocery industry is intensely competitive, with pressure from conventional supermarkets (Kroger), mass merchandisers (Walmart, Target), and other specialty retailers (Whole Foods). This could limit pricing power and margin expansion.
2.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation's growth assumptions depend on the successful execution of management's strategy, including opening 35+ new, smaller-format stores annually and achieving projected sales volumes.
3.  **Consumer Spending:** As a retailer of premium and organic products, Sprouts is exposed to shifts in consumer discretionary spending. An economic downturn could lead customers to trade down to lower-priced conventional grocers.
4.  **Supply Chain & Inflation:** Volatility in food inflation and supply chain disruptions can impact both cost of goods sold and product availability, pressing gross margins.

final answer is 113.33 $
