**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the SaaS industry, a key competitive advantage is a strong platform and ecosystem. ServiceNow's "Now Platform" is a single platform that serves as the foundation for all its workflow automation products, creating a powerful network effect and high switching costs for customers. The company's growing partner ecosystem, including relationships with major technology companies and global system integrators, further strengthens its competitive position.
**Answer:** Yes

The company's willingness to invest in new technologies like AI, even before they are fully mature, demonstrates a long-range outlook. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management's commentary focused on the long-term opportunity and the company's positioning for sustained growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ServiceNow has a strong balance sheet with $6.13 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments as of June 30, 2025. The company also generates significant free cash flow ($535 million in Q2 2025). The board of directors has also authorized a share repurchase program, indicating confidence in the company's financial position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ServiceNow provides detailed financial results and hosts regular earnings calls with Q&A sessions. The company's investor relations website provides a wealth of information, including SEC filings, press releases, and presentations. The Q2 2025 earnings call transcript demonstrates a willingness to address analyst questions directly.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ServiceNow's 2024 10-K includes a section on the company's values, which include "Win as a team" and "Stay hungry and humble." The company has a code of conduct and a commitment to ESG principles. However, the 10-K also discloses an internal investigation into potential compliance issues related to a government contract, which resulted in the resignation of the President and COO. While the company has taken action to address this issue, it raises questions about the integrity of some members of the management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371525000010/now-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1373715/000137371525000010/now-20241231.htm) (January 29, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:** ServiceNow scores highly on most of Fisher's 15 points, demonstrating a strong competitive position, a commitment to innovation, and a solid financial foundation. The company's focus on the expanding enterprise digital transformation market, its robust platform, and its growing partner ecosystem are key strengths. The recent investigation into a government contract and the subsequent resignation of a key executive are a concern and the primary reason for the "No" on the final point. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months include the successful execution of its AI strategy, continued margin improvement, and a demonstrated commitment to the highest ethical standards in the wake of the recent compliance issue. A clean record with no further compliance issues would be the most significant factor in flipping the "No" to a "Yes".

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
