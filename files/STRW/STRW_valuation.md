### **C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

| Assumption | Value/Method | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **15.0%** | No formal guidance was provided. The 3-year revenue CAGR from FY2021-FY2024 was 14.1% (($117.06M / $87.03M)^(1/3)-1). The chosen 15.0% rate is slightly above this historical average, reflecting management's commentary on a strong acquisition pipeline. (StockAnalysis Income Statement, Aug 8, 2025). |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **53.0%** | The TTM operating margin is 53.7% ($72.54M / $135.15M). The average of the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024) is 52.1%. A stable margin of 53.0% is assumed as there were no specific management comments on margin expansion initiatives. (StockAnalysis Income Statement, Aug 8, 2025). |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **0.0%** | As a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), STRW generally does not pay corporate income tax, provided it distributes at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders. No tax expense is modeled. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **30.0%** | TTM D&A is 29.8% of revenue ($40.35M / $135.15M). The 3-year average is similar. This rate is held constant. (StockAnalysis Financials, Aug 8, 2025). |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.05%** | TTM SBC is 0.05% of revenue ($0.07M / $135.15M). This is treated as a real cash cost. (StockAnalysis Financials, Aug 8, 2025). |
| **Capex as % of Revenue**| **15.0%**| Capex is volatile due to acquisitions. The TTM capex of $148.57M is exceptionally high. A normalized rate of 15% of revenue is used, aligning with historical periods of expansion and factoring in management's acquisition commentary. |
| **Change in WC** | **5.0% of Δ Revenue** | Based on the historical relationship between working capital and revenue growth. TTM Change in WC was $7.04M on revenue growth of $27.9M (a high 25%). A more normalized 5.0% is used. (StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement, Aug 8, 2025). |

### **D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in Working Capital

### **E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

| Component | Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | *CAPM = R_f + Beta * (ERP)* | **5.29%** |
| Risk-Free Rate (R_f) | Latest 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield | 4.29% (YCharts, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Beta (5-Year) | Reflects lower volatility than the market, typical for a stable, necessity-based REIT. | 0.20 (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP)| Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. | 5.00% |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | *Interest Expense / Total Debt* = $44.64M / $790.02M | **5.65%** |
| After-Tax Kd | *Kd * (1 - Tax Rate)* = 5.65% * (1 - 0%) | **5.65%** |

| **WACC** | *(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd)* | **5.59%** |

### **F) TERMINAL VALUE**

The Gordon Growth Model is used to calculate the terminal value, with a conservative growth rate appropriate for a mature company.

*   **Formula:** Terminal Value = [FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a reasonable assumption for long-term inflation and GDP growth, ensuring the company does not outgrow the economy in perpetuity.

*   **Calculation:**
    *   Terminal Value = [$183.00M * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.0559 - 0.025)
    *   Terminal Value = $187.58M / 0.0309 = **$6,070.5M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT_Yr5 + D&A_Yr5 = $144.07M + $81.55M = $225.62M
    *   Typical healthcare REIT EV/EBITDA multiples range from 10x-15x. A conservative 12x multiple is used.
    *   Implied Terminal Value = $225.62M * 12 = **$2,707.4M**
    *   There is a significant discrepancy. The lower value from the exit multiple method is chosen as it provides a more conservative and realistic valuation cross-check against market multiples.
    *   **Selected Terminal Value:** **$2,707.4M**

### **RISK NOTES**

1.  **Tenant Concentration:** A significant portion of revenue may come from a small number of tenants. Financial distress of a major tenant could materially impact revenues.
2.  **Regulatory Risk:** The skilled nursing industry is heavily reliant on government reimbursement programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Changes in reimbursement rates or regulations could negatively affect tenant profitability and, consequently, STRW's rental income.
3.  **Interest Rate Risk:** Although management states most debt is fixed-rate, future acquisitions or refinancing needs could be subject to higher interest rates, increasing expenses and reducing cash flow.
4.  **Acquisition-Dependent Growth:** The company's growth is heavily tied to its ability to find and execute accretive acquisitions. A competitive market or lack of suitable properties could slow future growth below historical rates.

final answer is 150.64 $
