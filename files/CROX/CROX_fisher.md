### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a strong commitment to continuous development. For the Crocs brand, this involves introducing new designs, colors, and collaborations for its iconic clog, alongside expanding into new silhouettes like sandals. For the HEYDUDE brand, the focus is on diversifying beyond its core Wendy and Wally loafers into new categories. The company consistently invests in marketing and partnerships (e.g., McDonald's, Toy Story, Sydney Sweeney) to drive consumer engagement and acquisition.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs' R&D is focused on materials science (Croslite™, LiteRide™) and product design. The company spent $25.6 million on research, design, and development in 2024, which is approximately 0.6% of its $4.1 billion in revenue. While the percentage is modest, its effectiveness is demonstrated through the sustained global popularity of its core molded products and the successful introduction of new silhouettes and materials that leverage its comfort-focused technology. The brand's ability to innovate within its core competency of molded footwear is a key competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs has a robust multi-channel sales organization. The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel, which provides higher margins, grew to 49.7% of consolidated revenues in 2024, up from 45.1% in 2022. This includes 23 company-operated e-commerce sites and a global fleet of 442 retail stores as of year-end 2024. The company's digital sales (including e-tailers) were 37.2% of consolidated revenues, indicating a strong ability to meet consumers where they shop.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs demonstrates exceptional profitability. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a consolidated gross margin of 58.8% and an operating margin of 24.9%. These margins are very strong for the footwear industry, which typically sees gross margins in the 40-50% range and operating margins in the high-single to low-double digits. The high margins are driven by the low cost of its molded products and a growing DTC sales mix.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on maintaining and improving margins. Gross margin increased by 300 basis points in 2024 to 58.8%, driven by higher average selling prices, a favorable customer and brand mix, and the absence of prior year distribution costs. The company's strategic shift toward the higher-margin DTC channel and price increases have been key drivers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company reports a highly engaged global workforce based on regular employee engagement scores. As of December 31, 2024, Crocs employed over 7,910 people globally. The company highlights initiatives like pay transparency, employee training, and creating a culture of inclusion. It also requires its third-party manufacturers to comply with a Social Compliance Code of Conduct and a Human Rights Policy, upholding international labor standards. There are no mentions of significant labor disputes or union-related issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team and board appear stable. Andrew Rees has served as CEO since 2017, providing long-term leadership continuity. The signature page of the most recent 10-K shows a consistent board and executive team. This stability at the top suggests a cohesive and effective working relationship among senior leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a well-defined management structure with distinct leadership for its two core brands, Crocs and HEYDUDE, as well as seasoned executives overseeing finance, operations, and legal functions. The 10-K names a Chief Executive Officer and a Chief Financial Officer, and the corporate governance documents typically incorporated by reference from the proxy statement detail a broader executive team, indicating operational depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs' management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was audited by their independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. The 10-K provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for clear cost and profitability analysis of the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs' key competitive advantages are its proprietary Croslite™ material technology and its unique, iconic clog silhouette. This combination provides a strong, defensible moat. Furthermore, the company has transformed a simple shoe into a platform for personalization and expression through its Jibbitz™ charms, creating a high-margin, sticky revenue stream and fostering a loyal consumer base that is difficult for competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in its 2024 10-K emphasizes a focus on "durable long-term growth" by investing in talent, marketing, digital capabilities, and retail. They explicitly state their focus is on making the "right decisions for the health of our brands" and investing in strategic initiatives. This language, coupled with consistent brand-building investments even as the HEYDUDE brand faced headwinds, points to a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is very strong. Crocs generated $992.5 million in cash from operating activities in 2024. Rather than issuing shares, the company is actively returning capital to shareholders, having repurchased $551.2 million of its common stock in 2024. With $180.5 million in cash and over $824 million in available borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2024, Crocs is well-capitalized to fund growth without dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management appears to be candid in its communications. The 2024 10-K openly addresses the challenges and revenue decline in the HEYDUDE brand, attributing it to lower sales volume while also explaining the strategies being implemented to address it, such as rightsizing the wholesale channel. This willingness to discuss underperforming segments in detail in its primary filing and on earnings calls suggests a high level of transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025), ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CROX/transcripts/'](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CROX/transcripts/) (May 8, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the "Legal Proceedings" and "Risk Factors" sections of the 2024 10-K does not reveal any material litigation, regulatory actions, or related-party transactions that would call the integrity of the management team into question. The company maintains a global ethics hotline and conducts annual compliance training. The absence of major governance red flags supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1334036/000133403625000009/crox-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

**Synthesis**

Crocs, Inc. scores exceptionally well against Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a business with strong brand identity, outstanding profitability, and a sound long-term strategy. The company's core strengths lie in its unique and defensible product (the clog), high-margin business model, and robust cash flow generation, which it uses to reward shareholders via buybacks rather than dilutive financing. The primary variable that could change this score in the next 12–24 months is the performance of the HEYDUDE brand. While the core Crocs brand continues to show strong growth, HEYDUDE revenues declined 13.2% in 2024. A successful turnaround and return to growth for HEYDUDE would solidify the rationale for its acquisition and affirm management's capital allocation strategy; a continued decline could turn the "Yes" on long-runway products into a "No" at the consolidated level and call into question management's execution.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
