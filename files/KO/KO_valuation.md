Of course. I have reviewed your valuation of The Coca-Cola Company. Your process and structure are excellent, demonstrating a clear understanding of the DCF methodology. You correctly identified that the market-implied growth rate seems optimistic, which is a great starting point for an independent analysis.

The primary issues in your model are concentrated in the discount rate (WACC) calculation, which uses inputs (Beta and Equity Risk Premium) that are too low, and a revenue growth assumption that, while conservative, could be refined to better reflect the company's proven pricing power. A low WACC significantly inflates the present value of future cash flows, especially the terminal value, leading to a higher-than-justified valuation.

I have adjusted these assumptions to be more aligned with market standards and the company's specific situation, which provides a more realistic and defensible fair value estimate.

Here is the revised valuation in the same format, with the flaws corrected.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions about future performance that are embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$70.13** (TradingView, August 22, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM):** The following table presents the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) financial data for the period ended June 27, 2025.

| Metric | Amount (in millions USD) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $47,062 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Gross Profit | $28,908 | (Calculated: $47,062 Rev \* 61.42% GM) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $14,701 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Net Income | $12,183 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/cash-flow-statement/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $1,090 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/cash-flow-statement/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $276 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/cash-flow-statement/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | $2,023 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/cash-flow-statement/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($12,481) | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/cash-flow-statement/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | $1,688 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $9,590 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/balance-sheet/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $50,213 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/balance-sheet/, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 4,317 | (stockanalysis.com/stocks/ko/financials/, Aug 22, 2025) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the market price of **$70.13** per share, given a more realistic WACC of 6.78% (calculation in Part 2) and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, the market is pricing in very strong future performance. Holding the operating margin constant at the TTM level of **31.2%**, the model requires a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.1%**.

*   **Market-Implied Assumption:** To justify today's stock price, one must believe Coca-Cola will grow its revenue by **7.1% annually** for the next five years while maintaining its current high operating margin of **31.2%**. This is significantly above its historical average and long-term targets.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on more realistic, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** Your original 4.0% revenue growth assumption was prudently conservative. However, Coca-Cola's long-term guidance is for 4-6% organic growth, and it has consistently used its brand power to drive price/mix growth that outpaces inflation. A slightly higher rate reflects this reality.
7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:** My model assumes a **4.5%** annual revenue growth rate. This is in the middle of the company's long-term guidance, below the market's implied 7.1%, and reflects a balance of modest volume growth and persistent pricing power.
8.  **Margin Path:** The 30.0% operating margin assumption is sound. It normalizes recent performance and represents a realistic, sustainable level of profitability. This assumption is maintained.
9.  **Taxes:** The normalized tax rate of **19.0%** is appropriate and based on historical data. This is maintained.
10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assuming capex remains at **4.0% of revenue** is a reasonable normalization of historical spending. This is maintained.
    *   **Working Capital:** Assuming a normalized **5.0% of incremental revenue** is a sound approach to smooth out the anomalous TTM figure. This is maintained.
11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   Projecting SBC at **0.6% of revenue** is consistent with historicals. This is maintained.
    *   Projecting a **net 0.5% annual reduction** in the diluted share count due to buybacks is a good detail and is maintained.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Formula:** Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
    `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

13. **5-Year FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**

| Fiscal Year | Year 1 (2026E) | Year 2 (2027E) | Year 3 (2028E) | Year 4 (2029E) | Year 5 (2030E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $49,180 | $51,393 | $53,706 | $56,122 | $58,648 |
| EBIT (30.0% margin) | $14,754 | $15,418 | $16,112 | $16,837 | $17,594 |
| NOPAT (EBIT \* (1-T)) | $11,951 | $12,488 | $13,051 | $13,638 | $14,251 |
| \+ D&A (2.3% of Rev) | $1,131 | $1,182 | $1,235 | $1,291 | $1,349 |
| \- SBC (0.6% of Rev) | ($295) | ($308) | ($322) | ($337) | ($352) |
| \- Capex (4.0% of Rev) | ($1,967) | ($2,056) | ($2,148) | ($2,245) | ($2,346) |
| \- Δ in Work. Cap. | ($106) | ($111) | ($116) | ($121) | ($126) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$10,714** | **$11,195** | **$11,700** | **$12,226** | **$12,776** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC) - REVISED**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.26%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.5%**. A more standard, widely accepted premium for the U.S. market.
    *   **Beta:** **0.58**. A more common and realistic beta for Coca-Cola, reflecting its defensive nature but acknowledging it is not immune to market movements. A beta of 0.44 is exceptionally low.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 0.58 \* 5.5% = 4.26% + 3.19% = **7.45%***
15. **Cost of Debt:** `Interest Expense / Total Debt` = $1,688M / $50,213M = 3.36%. After a 19.0% tax shield, the after-tax cost of debt is **2.72%**.
16. **WACC Calculation:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * After-Tax Cost of Debt`
    *   Market Cap (E): $70.13 \* 4,317M shares = $302,776M
    *   Total Debt (D): $50,213M
    *   E / (E+D) = 85.8%
    *   D / (E+D) = 14.2%
    *   *WACC = (0.858 \* 7.45%) + (0.142 \* 2.72%) = 6.39% + 0.39% = **6.78%***

**F) TERMINAL VALUE - REVISED**

17. **Gordon Growth Method:** `Terminal Value = FCFF_Yr5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)`
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This remains a sound assumption for a mature global company, aligned with long-run inflation and GDP growth.
    *   *Terminal Value = $12,776 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.0678 - 0.025) = $13,095 / 0.0428 = **$306,000M***
18. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($17,594M) + Year 5 D&A ($1,349M) = $18,943M.
    *   The Gordon Growth terminal value implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of $306,000M / $18,943M = **16.2x**.
    *   This implied multiple is more conservative than the 20.2x derived from the original, lower WACC. A 16.2x multiple is a very realistic terminal multiple for a high-quality but mature consumer staples company, validating the Gordon Growth inputs.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE - REVISED**

19. **Enterprise Value:** `EV = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value`
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: $10,034 + $9,800 + $9,566 + $9,334 + $9,105 = **$47,839M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $306,000M / (1 + 0.0678)^5 = **$219,836M**
    *   *Enterprise Value = $47,839M + $219,836M = **$267,675M***
20. **Equity Value:** `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($50,213M) - Cash ($9,590M) = **$40,623M** (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025).
    *   *Equity Value = $267,675M - $40,623M = **$227,052M***

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY - REVISED**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Shares in Year 5 (after 0.5% annual reduction): 4,210M shares
    *   *Fair Value Per Share = $227,052M / 4,210M = **$53.93***
22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $53.93**. Assumes 4.5% revenue growth and 30.0% operating margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$44**. Assumes 2.5% revenue growth and margin compression to 28%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$64**. Assumes 6.0% revenue growth (top end of guidance) and stable 30% margins.
23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for estimation errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   *MOS Price = $53.93 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$37.75***

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Shifting Consumer Preferences:** Continued movement away from sugary carbonated soft drinks toward healthier alternatives could persistently dampen volume growth in core markets.
2.  **Input Cost Volatility:** Significant fluctuations in the costs of raw materials (like sugar and aluminum) and freight could compress margins if not fully offset by pricing actions.
3.  **Regulatory Risks:** Increased government focus on health-related issues could lead to higher taxes on sugary beverages or stricter marketing regulations, impacting sales and profitability.
4.  **Currency Fluctuations:** As a global company, a significant portion of earnings comes from outside the U.S. A strengthening dollar can negatively impact reported earnings.
