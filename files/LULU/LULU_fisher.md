Date of analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary sources reviewed: LULU FY24 10-K (filed March 27, 2025), Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript (August 29, 2024).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon is executing against its "Power of Three ×2" growth plan, which targets doubling 2021 revenue to $12.5 billion by 2026. Key growth drivers include doubling men's and digital revenues, and quadrupling international revenues. The company is expanding into new product categories like footwear and sees significant opportunity in markets outside of North America, where brand awareness is still relatively low. For instance, in Q2 2024, international revenue increased 29%, with China Mainland revenue growing 34%. The company's FY24 10-K filing from March 27, 2025, also highlights significant net revenue growth in China Mainland and the "Rest of World" segments, at 41.3% and 26.8% respectively, underscoring the large opportunity in these markets.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon demonstrates a strong commitment to new product development and innovation. The company's FY24 10-K states, "We continue to innovate and introduce new products for our guests. This includes introducing new product categories and expanding our accessories assortment." In 2024, the company launched new casual and performance footwear styles, including its first collection for men. Management has explicitly stated that they continue to seek to create products that solve unmet needs, viewing technical product as a key competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon's R&D effectiveness is demonstrated through its "Science of Feel" innovation platform and a consistent pipeline of new products and fabric technologies. The company's product design and development team includes researchers, scientists, and engineers who collaborate with suppliers to create proprietary fabrics. While the 10-K does not break out R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, the success of new product launches and the expansion into categories like footwear indicates an effective innovation process. The company's strategy of collecting direct feedback from customers ("guests") allows it to incorporate unique performance and fashion needs into its design process, enhancing R&D effectiveness.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon employs a highly effective omni-channel retail model that seamlessly integrates its physical stores and e-commerce platforms. This strategy includes capabilities like "buy online pick-up in store" and "ship from store," providing a convenient guest experience. As of February 2, 2025, the company operated 767 stores globally and generated sales per square foot of $1,574 in fiscal 2024. The company's direct-to-consumer model fosters a strong customer connection and allows for effective brand control and higher margins. The company's global expansion, particularly in China, where it operates a WeChat store and on marketplaces like T-Mall, demonstrates a sophisticated and adaptable sales strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon consistently generates high profit margins relative to the apparel retail industry. For the fiscal year ended February 2, 2025, the company reported a gross margin of 59.2% and an operating margin of 23.7%. The gross margin increased by 90 basis points from the prior year. These strong margins are a result of the company's premium brand positioning, vertical retail strategy which limits markdowns, and strong demand for its products.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on maintaining and improving margins through several initiatives. In fiscal 2024, gross margin increased primarily due to lower product costs. The company's omni-channel model, including a "one inventory pool" system, allows for efficient inventory management, reducing the need for markdowns. While facing some deleverage on fixed costs like distribution centers, the company has stated it is prudently managing expenses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm) (March 27, 2025), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wAlL57m6pI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wAlL57m6pI) (August 29, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon emphasizes a distinctive corporate culture rooted in core values of personal responsibility, courage, connection, and fun. The FY24 10-K details extensive employee empowerment programs, including competitive compensation, a parenthood program with up to six months of paid leave, and various training and development opportunities. The company reports strong gender diversity, with women representing approximately 55% of the board of directors and 75% of the overall workforce as of February 2, 2025. The company also states it has achieved full pay equity across various demographics in regions where this is analyzed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon's executive team appears stable, with the senior leadership team overseeing the "Power of Three x2" growth strategy. As of February 2, 2025, the company's 10-K does not indicate any significant executive turnover or disputes. The board of directors and senior executive leadership team both have a majority of women, suggesting a commitment to diversity at the highest levels. While there is no explicit mention of succession planning in the provided documents, the overall stability suggests positive executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations page and public filings name a full executive team beyond the CEO, covering key functions like technology, finance, product, and international operations. For example, Julie Averill is the Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer, leading global technology and innovation strategies since May 2017. This indicates a professionalized management structure with experienced leaders in critical roles, suggesting sufficient depth to manage a growing global organization.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon's FY24 10-K, filed on March 27, 2025, includes a report from their independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which states that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2025. The financial statements are detailed, with clear segment reporting for the Americas, China Mainland, and Rest of World, providing good visibility into regional performance. There is no indication of significant restatements or material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon's key competitive advantage is its powerful brand, built on a community-based marketing model and a reputation for high-quality, technical products. The vertical retail and direct-to-consumer (DTC) strategy allows the company to control its brand image, maintain premium pricing, and gather direct customer feedback, which feeds into its product innovation loop. The high sales per square foot ($1,574 in FY24) is a testament to the productivity of its retail locations and the desirability of its products.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes its long-term "Power of Three ×2" growth strategy, which prioritizes significant investments in international expansion, product innovation, and digital capabilities. The company's Q2 2024 earnings call reaffirms its goal to quadruple international revenue from 2021 levels by the end of 2026. These large-scale investments, such as building out distribution centers and entering new markets, demonstrate a willingness to incur short-term costs to build a larger, more profitable business in the future.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lululemon has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations, totaling $2.3 billion in fiscal 2024. As of February 2, 2025, the company had nearly $2.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and an undrawn $400 million revolving credit facility. Instead of issuing shares, the company is actively returning capital to shareholders through a significant stock repurchase program, buying back $1.6 billion of its stock in fiscal 2024. This strong financial position indicates a very low risk of equity dilution to fund growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1397187/000139718725000013/lulu-20250202.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of transparency in its investor communications. In the Q2 2024 earnings call on August 29, 2024, executives openly addressed challenges, such as the 2% comparable sales decline in the Americas, and discussed the steps being taken to address them. The company provides detailed quarterly financial supplements and infographics alongside its earnings releases, offering clear data and insights into business performance. This consistent and open communication, even when discussing weaker performance in a key region, points to a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's FY24 10-K outlines a Global Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and its audit committee is responsible for overseeing compliance. The filing with the SEC on March 27, 2025, did not disclose any material legal proceedings related to fraud or insider dealings. The company has a formal Vendor Code of Ethics for its supply chain, which is based on international standards and is a component of supplier agreements. While a putative consumer class action regarding sustainability claims was filed and dismissed, and a securities class action is pending, these do not by themselves indicate a lack of integrity at the management level. There are no significant governance red flags apparent from the reviewed documents.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**

Lululemon scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a fundamentally strong business with multiple avenues for sustained, profitable growth. The company's primary strengths lie in its powerful brand, vertically integrated business model, high-margin financial profile, and robust long-term growth strategy focused on international expansion and product innovation. The balance sheet is pristine, with no debt and significant cash generation funding both growth investments and substantial share repurchases.

The most critical variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months are the performance of the Americas region and the execution of the international growth strategy. The recent slowdown in the Americas, its largest market, is a key focus. Continued weakness or a failure to reinvigorate growth in this core market could challenge the company's overall trajectory and potentially flip the "Long Runway" or "Above-Average Sales Organization" points to 'No'. Similarly, any significant stumbles in the China market, a key pillar of the "Power of Three x2" plan, would be a major concern. Evidence of a sustained return to positive comparable sales growth in the Americas and continued high-double-digit growth in China would be necessary to maintain the perfect score.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
