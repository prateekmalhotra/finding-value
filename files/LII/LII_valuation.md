**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current market price of $591.92, with a revised WACC of 8.6% (calculation in Part 2), the market is implying a **5-year revenue growth rate of approximately 10.5% and a constant operating margin of 19.43%.** This is a simplified model holding margins flat to solve for growth. This confirms the market's high valuation is pricing in significant, sustained, high-margin growth.

### PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6) Critical Review:** The market-implied 10.5% growth is optimistic. The original analyst's 7% tapering to 5% is a more reasonable starting point. However, several assumptions can be refined for greater realism, particularly the constant margin, the cost of debt, and the terminal value multiple.

**7) Revenue for Years 1–5:** A tapering growth model remains appropriate. I will assume **7%** growth for Year 1, **6%** for Year 2, and **5%** for Years 3-5, reflecting strong near-term demand from replacement cycles and energy efficiency incentives, followed by normalization.

**8) Margin Path:** Assuming a constant operating margin is unrealistic due to competitive pressures and input cost volatility. I will model a modest **10 basis point (0.10%) annual compression** in the EBIT margin, from 19.43% in Year 1 to 19.03% in Year 5.

**9) Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is 18.66%. A normalized statutory rate is more appropriate for long-term forecasting. I will use **21%**, which is closer to the U.S. corporate statutory rate.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM capex is 2.87% of revenue. Assuming capex remains at a slightly higher **3.0% of revenue** is a prudent assumption for maintaining and growing the asset base.
    *   **Working Capital:** A negative change in working capital is not sustainable long-term. I will assume a more typical relationship where investment in net working capital is **5% of the incremental revenue** each year.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** I will subtract Stock-Based Compensation from FCFF, treating it as a real economic expense. I will grow it in line with revenue.
    *   **Dilution:** I will assume a net **1% annual reduction** in shares outstanding, reflecting the company's historical tendency for buybacks to outweigh SBC-related dilution.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) FCFF Calculation:** A detailed 5-year forecast is constructed below based on the assumptions in section C.
FCFF = EBIT * (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD in millions) | YR 1 (2026) | YR 2 (2027) | YR 3 (2028) | YR 4 (2029) | YR 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 7.0% | 6.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% |
| **Revenue** | **$5,796** | **$6,144** | **$6,451** | **$6,774** | **$7,113** |
| | | | | | |
| EBIT Margin | 19.43% | 19.33% | 19.23% | 19.13% | 19.03% |
| **EBIT** | **$1,126** | **$1,188** | **$1,241** | **$1,295** | **$1,353** |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-21%)) | $890 | $938 | $980 | $1,023 | $1,070 |
| (+) D&A (1.8% of Rev) | $104 | $111 | $116 | $122 | $128 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $32 | $34 | $35 | $37 | $39 |
| (-) Capex (3.0% of Rev) | $174 | $184 | $194 | $203 | $213 |
| (-) Chg. in WC (5% of ΔRev) | $19 | $17 | $15 | $16 | $17 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$769** | **$813** | **$852** | **$889** | **$928** |

**13) FCFF Rationale:** FCFF is the appropriate metric as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is not distorted by changes in leverage.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year Treasury Yield, August 2025)
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.5% (A more standard, mid-range assumption)
*   **Beta:** 0.95
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 0.95 * 5.5% = 9.48%**

**15) Cost of Debt:** The original 2.5% is unrealistically low given a 4.25% risk-free rate. A market-based estimate is better.
*   **Cost of Debt = Risk-Free Rate + Credit Spread**
*   **Cost of Debt = 4.25% + 1.50% (Assumed for BBB/A-rated industrial) = 5.75%**

**16) WACC:**
*   **Market Cap:** $21.3B
*   **WACC = (E / (E + D)) * CoE + (D / (E + D)) * CoD * (1 - Tax Rate)**
*   **WACC = (21.3 / 22.8) * 9.48% + (1.5 / 22.8) * 5.75% * (1 - 0.21) = 8.86% + 0.30% = 9.16%**
    *Using the original 8.0% WACC was a significant flaw as it was based on an understated Cost of Debt and ERP, leading to an inflated valuation.*

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Exit Multiple:** For a mature, cyclical industrial company like Lennox, an Exit Multiple approach is often more realistic than a perpetuity growth model as it reflects market sentiment for comparable assets at the point of "exit." The original 12x multiple was slightly conservative. A **13.0x EV/EBITDA** multiple is more appropriate, reflecting the company's strong brand, service/replacement revenue stream, and positioning in the energy efficiency trend.
*   Year 5 EBIT: $1,353M
*   Year 5 D&A: $128M
*   **Year 5 EBITDA = $1,481M**
*   **Terminal Value = 13.0 * $1,481M = $19,253M**

**18) Gordon Growth Cross-Check:** A 2.5% terminal growth rate provides a sanity check.
*   Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
*   Terminal Value = ($928 * 1.025) / (9.16% - 2.50%) = $951 / 6.66% = **$14,285M**
*   The significant divergence suggests that an exit multiple is the more grounded and realistic approach, as the market is likely to value this stable business on a multiple basis rather than its long-term growth prospects alone. I will proceed with the Exit Multiple valuation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value:** PV of 5-year FCFF + PV of Terminal Value
*   PV of 5-year FCFF: ($769/1.0916¹) + ($813/1.0916²) + ($852/1.0916³) + ($889/1.0916⁴) + ($928/1.0916⁵) = $705 + $682 + $656 + $627 + $598 = **$3,268M**
*   PV of Terminal Value: $19,253M / (1.0916⁵) = **$12,410M**
*   **Total Enterprise Value = $3,268M + $12,410M = $15,678M**

**20) Equity Value:** Enterprise Value - Net Debt ($1,546M Debt - $49.2M Cash) = $15,678M - $1,496.8M = **$14,181.2M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   To account for the 1% annual share reduction over 5 years, the terminal share count is approximately 34.2M.
*   Fair Value = $14,181.2M / 34.2M shares = **$414.65**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case:** $414.65
*   **Low/Bear Case:** $330 (Lower growth at 3-4%, margin compression to 18.5%, 11x exit multiple)
*   **High/Bull Case:** $515 (Higher growth at 6-8%, stable margins, 14x exit multiple)

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** $414.65 * (1 - 0.30) = **$290.26**

### Risk Notes

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** Demand for HVAC systems is cyclical and sensitive to the health of the housing market, commercial construction, and broader economic confidence.
2.  **Competition:** The HVAC industry is highly competitive, with pressure from both established players (Carrier, Trane, Daikin) and new entrants, which could pressure the modeled margins.
3.  **Technological Disruption:** A failure to innovate in energy efficiency, refrigerants, and smart home integration could lead to market share loss and brand erosion.

final answer is 414.65 $
