### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Yr 1)** | **25.0%**. This is a conservative estimate below the most recent quarter's 31% growth, factoring in the law of large numbers and potential macroeconomic headwinds. | |
| **Revenue Growth (Yr 2-5)** | **20.0%, 18.0%, 15.0%, 12.0%**. A declining growth rate is assumed as the company matures and the market becomes more saturated. | Analyst Estimate |
| **Operating Margin** | **15.4%**. The TTM operating margin is used, as management has demonstrated a focus on operational efficiency. | |
| **Tax Rate** | **15%**. This is a long-term estimated corporate tax rate. | Analyst Estimate |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **0.16%**. Based on the TTM capex to revenue ratio. | |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **4.5%**. Based on TTM stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. | |
| **Change in WC as % of Revenue** | **-1.1%**. Based on the TTM change in working capital as a percentage of revenue. | |

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**FCFF Formula:** EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions USD) | Yr 1 | Yr 2 | Yr 3 | Yr 4 | Yr 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $12,518 | $15,021 | $17,725 | $20,384 | $22,830 |
| EBIT (15.4%) | $1,928 | $2,313 | $2,730 | $3,139 | $3,516 |
| EBIT \* (1-Tax Rate) | $1,639 | $1,966 | $2,321 | $2,668 | $2,989 |
| \+ D&A | $20 | $24 | $28 | $33 | $37 |
| \- SBC | $563 | $676 | $798 | $917 | $1,027 |
| \- Capex | $20 | $24 | $28 | $33 | $37 |
| \- Change in WC | ($138) | ($165) | ($195) | ($224) | ($251) |
| **FCFF** | **$1,214** | **$1,455** | **$1,718** | **$1,975** | **$2,213** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.25 (Reflects higher volatility than the broader market, typical for growth-oriented tech stocks).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.25 \* 5.0% = 10.50%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = $0 / $1,139 million = 0%. Given the zero interest expense on convertible notes, a pre-tax cost of debt of 4.5% is assumed based on prevailing corporate borrowing rates for similar companies.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.5% \* (1-15%) = 3.83%
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Cap (Equity): $180 billion (approx. as of August 20, 2025)
    *   Market Value of Debt: $1,139 million
    *   **WACC = (180/181.139)\*10.50% + (1.139/181.139)\*3.83% = 10.45%**

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (Long-run inflation expectation).
    *   Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF \* (1+g)) / (WACC - g) = ($2,213 \* 1.025) / (10.45% - 2.5%) = **$28,552 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + D&A = $3,516 + $37 = $3,553 million
    *   Assume a conservative 20x EV/EBITDA multiple.
    *   Terminal Value = $3,553 million * 20 = **$71,060 million**
    *   The Gordon Growth method results in a more conservative terminal value and will be used.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:**
    *   Year 1: $1,214 / (1.1045)^1 = $1,099
    *   Year 2: $1,455 / (1.1045)^2 = $1,192
    *   Year 3: $1,718 / (1.1045)^3 = $1,273
    *   Year 4: $1,975 / (1.1045)^4 = $1,327
    *   Year 5: $2,213 / (1.1045)^5 = $1,343
    *   **Total PV of FCFF = $6,234 million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $28,552 / (1.1045)^5 = **$17,330 million**
*   **Enterprise Value:** $6,234 million + $17,330 million = **$23,564 million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Enterprise Value: $23,564 million
    *   Less: Total Debt: $1,139 million
    *   Plus: Cash & Equivalents: $1,542 million
    *   **Equity Value = $23,967 million**

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** $23,967 million / 1,312 million shares = **$18.27 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $18.27
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Slower revenue growth (e.g., 20% Yr 1, declining to 10%) and margin compression to 13% could result in a value closer to **$12 per share.**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Sustained higher revenue growth (e.g., 30% Yr 1, declining to 15%) and margin expansion to 18% could result in a value closer to **$28 per share.**
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** 30% below Base Case = $18.27 * (1 - 0.30) = **$12.79**

### One-paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include a slowdown in e-commerce growth, increased competition from other platforms and marketplaces, potential for margin compression due to investments in growth initiatives and international expansion, and the challenge of maintaining a high rate of innovation in a rapidly evolving market. Regulatory changes related to online commerce and data privacy could also pose a risk.

final answer is 18.27 $
