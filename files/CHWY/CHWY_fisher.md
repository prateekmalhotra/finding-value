Chewy, Inc., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: FY2024 10-K filed March 26, 2025, and Q1 2025 Earnings Call held June 11, 2025.

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The U.S. pet market is large and growing, with spending increasing from $92 billion in 2018 to an estimated $151 billion in 2024. This growth is driven by the "pet humanization" trend, with 93% of pet owners considering pets part of the family, leading to higher spending per pet. Chewy is expanding its total addressable market by moving into high-margin areas like pet health, including telehealth, compounding pharmacies, pet insurance, and opening its own veterinary clinics in 2024. The company also expanded internationally into Canada in 2023, a market where approximately 63% of households own a pet.
**Answer:** Yes

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy demonstrates a strong commitment to expanding its ecosystem beyond core retail. In 2024, the company launched "Chewy Vet Care," opening eight veterinary clinics with a proprietary technology platform to create a seamless experience for pet parents and veterinarians. This follows a series of healthcare expansions including the launch of CarePlus insurance and wellness plans, the "Connect with a Vet" telehealth service, and PracticeHub, an e-commerce solution for veterinarians that now enrolls an estimated 50% of all U.S. vet clinics. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Sumit Singh emphasized the strategy of "expanding the portfolio of businesses that we operate," highlighting the move into services as a key growth driver.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CHWY/transcripts/2025/1/', June 11, 2025]

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy does not break out R&D as a separate line item; it is included in Selling, General & Administrative expenses. However, the effectiveness of its development efforts is evident in its successful expansion into new categories and the creation of a robust technology platform. The company developed its own custom platform for its new Chewy Vet Care clinics and launched PracticeHub, a proprietary e-commerce and pharmacy management tool for veterinarians. The rapid scaling of its sponsored ads business, from a beta version in 2022 to a comprehensive suite of ad products, further demonstrates effective in-house development that creates high-margin revenue streams.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an e-commerce company, Chewy's "sales organization" is its platform and marketing. The company's key strength is its Autoship subscription program, which drives significant customer loyalty and recurring revenue. Autoship customer sales grew to $9.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2024, representing 79.2% of total net sales, up from 76.2% in the prior year. The company's active customer base grew to 20.5 million, and net sales per active customer increased 4.1% to $578 in Fiscal Year 2024. This demonstrates a highly effective, automated sales model that consistently increases customer value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy has demonstrated consistent gross margin expansion, reaching 29.2% in Fiscal Year 2024, up from 28.4% in 2023 and 28.0% in 2022. This improvement reflects supply chain efficiencies and margin expansion in its consumables and healthcare businesses. While the company's net margin was 3.3% in Fiscal Year 2024 (positively impacted by a one-time deferred tax asset release), its Adjusted EBITDA margin, a key metric used by management, has also steadily improved, reaching 4.8% in Fiscal Year 2024 from 3.3% in the prior year. This demonstrates a clear trend of improving profitability at scale.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement through multiple initiatives. The company is driving supply chain efficiencies through investments in automation and artificial intelligence within its fulfillment centers. It is also expanding into higher-margin businesses, such as its sponsored ads program and the broader pet healthcare ecosystem (pharmacy, insurance, vet clinics), which carry structurally higher margins than its core retail business. The growth of its private brands, such as Frisco and American Journey, also provides an avenue for margin expansion by offering products with compelling quality and pricing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's FY2024 10-K filing states that as of March 19, 2025, none of its approximately 18,000 employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The company highlights its competitive compensation and benefits, employee safety focus, and community involvement through its Chewy Gives Back program. While these disclosures are positive, there is no independently verifiable, quantitative data provided in the filings (e.g., attrition rates, engagement scores) to definitively benchmark its labor relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability in key roles. Sumit Singh has been CEO since March 2018, and Satish Mehta has been CTO since June 2018. The company recently hired a new CFO, David Reeder, in February 2024, who brings extensive public company experience from his time at GlobalFoundries Inc. There are no public reports of executive infighting or instability. The board composition and governance structure are detailed in filings, indicating a professional and orderly management environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's executive team extends beyond the CEO, with experienced leaders in key roles such as a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, and a President of Chewy Health. The hiring of a new CFO with public company and IPO experience in February 2024 demonstrates a commitment to building a management team with the skills to manage a large, complex organization. While specific succession plans are not publicly detailed, the existence of divisional leaders (e.g., Chewy Health, Retail) suggests a degree of management depth and delegation of responsibilities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEjRjsgqF971k6RVdF-y-ZJJjD2KygUDncqt9pwG85gi-BLEZT3um6NjRj4cV67pBNOGDW3OonzaeSOk8HQuSCSegSV9Hs3Vuy17Y2ZbIVl8rZmw2Az6NUuhMHvkqtdC2oPd-ijrcWvLPbrHQS7lzjV8Ord9CXL64Ug0Po=', ''], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2025. In its report, management concluded that its internal controls were effective. The financial statements provide a reasonable level of detail, breaking out key cost components like fulfillment and advertising, and provide supplemental non-GAAP metrics like Adjusted EBITDA to aid in analysis. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's most significant competitive advantage is the success of its Autoship subscription model. In Fiscal Year 2024, Autoship sales accounted for 79.2% of total net sales, up from 76.2% the prior year, indicating an extremely loyal and engaged customer base. This creates a powerful recurring revenue stream and a significant barrier to entry for competitors. The company's vertical integration into pet healthcare, from telehealth and pharmacy to now physical clinics, creates a sticky ecosystem that competitors in pure retail or pure healthcare cannot easily replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has consistently demonstrated a willingness to invest for the long term. The company is making significant investments in new, growth-oriented areas that may not be profitable in the short term, such as the launch of Chewy Vet Care clinics and its international expansion into Canada. CEO Sumit Singh stated in the Q1 2025 earnings call that the company is "judiciously deploying capital against our strategic roadmap" and focused on initiatives that produce "sustainable, profitable growth." This language, coupled with the ongoing strategic investments, indicates a focus on building durable, long-term value over maximizing short-term profits.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CHWY/transcripts/2025/1/', June 11, 2025]

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's financial position is strong. The company generated $452.5 million in free cash flow in Fiscal Year 2024 and ended the year with $595.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings on its $800 million ABL credit facility. Furthermore, the company's board of directors authorized a $500 million share repurchase program in May 2024, demonstrating that it has sufficient capital to both invest in growth and return cash to shareholders, rather than needing to issue dilutive equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed financial and operating metrics in its filings and presentations, including key performance indicators like active customers and net sales per active customer. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, executives addressed the "discretionary" spending environment and its impact on the hardgoods category directly, providing color on consumer behavior rather than avoiding the topic. They also provide forward-looking guidance, which demonstrates a degree of transparency with investors. The overall tone of communications appears professional and forthcoming.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CHWY/transcripts/2025/1/', June 11, 2025]

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's FY2024 10-K reveals no material legal proceedings that would suggest a lack of integrity. The company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and the auditor's report is clean. Related-party transactions with the controlling shareholder (BC Partners) are disclosed, primarily concerning the corporate reorganization and secondary stock offerings. There are no apparent governance red flags or evidence of management enriching themselves at the expense of shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm', March 26, 2025]

---
Synthesis:
Chewy scores strongly across Fisher's checklist, reflecting a robust business with significant competitive advantages and a long-term growth orientation. The company's primary strengths are its dominant position in a growing market, its highly effective Autoship subscription model that creates a powerful recurring revenue stream, and its strategic expansion into the higher-margin pet healthcare sector. The balance sheet is strong, cash flow is positive, and management appears stable and aligned with long-term value creation. The only "No" score relates to the lack of independently verifiable data to confirm "outstanding" labor relations, a common issue for companies that do not voluntarily disclose such metrics. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the execution of its Chewy Vet Care strategy. Successfully scaling these clinics could significantly alter the company's margin profile and competitive positioning, potentially solidifying its status as an all-encompassing pet ecosystem. Evidence of significant market share gains in the veterinary space or a meaningful acceleration in profitability from these new services would be key catalysts.

fisher score is 14 / 15
