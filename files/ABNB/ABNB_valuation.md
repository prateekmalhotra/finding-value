Of course. Here is a thorough review and corrected version of the valuation for Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB).

The original valuation was well-structured but contained several critical flaws that led to an overly conservative estimate. The primary issues were:
1.  **Cost of Debt & WACC:** Assuming a 0% cost of debt because LTM interest expense was zero is incorrect. The company has debt on its balance sheet, which carries an implicit market cost. This error inflated the WACC, artificially suppressing the valuation.
2.  **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** Modeling SBC as a flat dollar amount ($1,512M) is unrealistic. As revenue grows, SBC should be modeled as a percentage of revenue that declines over time as the company matures. The original method disproportionately penalized cash flows in later years.
3.  **Working Capital:** The logic for calculating the change in working capital in the forecast table was inverted. For Airbnb, negative working capital is a source of cash, but the original model incorrectly treated it as a use of cash.
4.  **Terminal Value Multiple:** While correctly identifying the Gordon Growth model's output as too low, the chosen 12.0x exit multiple was still quite conservative for a market-leading, asset-light business with strong network effects.

The following revised valuation corrects these flaws and adjusts assumptions to be more aligned with financial reality while maintaining the original's structure and detail.

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS - REVISED**

To solve for the market's implied assumptions, we must first estimate a more accurate Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

*   **Revised WACC Calculation:**
    *   *Risk-Free Rate:* 4.25% (Approximation of the current 10-year U.S. Treasury yield).
    *   *Equity Risk Premium:* 5.0% (Standard assumption for a mature market).
    *   *Beta:* 1.34 (A commonly cited beta for ABNB, reflecting its volatility).
    *   *Cost of Equity:* 4.25% + 1.34 \* 5.0% = **10.95%**
    *   *Cost of Debt:* Although interest expense is zero (likely due to convertible debt), the company has debt. A company of Airbnb's profile would likely have a credit rating in the BBB range. The pre-tax cost of debt for such a company is estimated at **5.5%**.
    *   *After-Tax Cost of Debt:* 5.5% * (1 - 0.21) = 4.35%.
    *   *Market Value of Equity (E):* $82,369M ($129.92 * 634M).
    *   *Market Value of Debt (D):* $2,282M.
    *   *WACC = (E/(E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D/(E+D)) * After-Tax Cost of Debt*
    *   *WACC = (82369/84651) * 10.95% + (2282/84651) * 4.35% = 10.66% + 0.12% = **10.78%***

Using the current Enterprise Value of approximately $73,840 million and holding the LTM EBIT margin of 22.5% constant, a reverse DCF model with the corrected WACC indicates the following:

> To justify the current market price of $129.92 per share, one must believe Airbnb can grow its revenue at a **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 14.8% over the next five years**, while maintaining its current operating margin of 22.5%. This is slightly less demanding than the original 16.5% estimate due to a more accurate (and slightly lower) discount rate.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on corrected and more realistic assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Rationale:** The market-implied 14.8% growth is achievable but optimistic. Acknowledging increasing market saturation and the law of large numbers, a tapering growth rate is more prudent. The company's scale and dominant brand position still support strong, albeit decelerating, growth.
    *   **Assumption:** I will model a tapering growth rate: **13% in Year 1, declining by 1.5% annually to 7% in Year 5.**

7.  **Margin Path:**
    *   **Rationale:** The 22.5% LTM operating margin is robust. With operating leverage from its platform model, there is potential for modest margin expansion as fixed costs are spread over a larger revenue base.
    *   **Assumption:** Operating margin will gradually expand from **22.5% to 24.0%** over the 5-year forecast period, reflecting increased efficiency and scale.

8.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Rationale:** The LTM effective tax rate was 20.67%.
    *   **Assumption:** I will use a **21.0% effective tax rate**, aligning with the U.S. statutory rate.

9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Rationale:** As an asset-light platform, Capex is minimal. The company benefits from negative working capital as it collects cash from guests before remitting payment to hosts.
    *   **Assumption (Capex):** Capex will be modeled at **1.0% of revenue**.
    *   **Assumption (Working Capital):** Change in Working Capital will be a *source* of cash, modeled at **-3.0% of incremental revenue**, consistent with its business model.

10. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **Rationale:** Stock-based compensation is a significant expense but should decline as a percentage of revenue as the company matures. The current LTM SBC is ~13% of revenue. This is unsustainably high and will be tapered.
    *   **Assumption (SBC):** SBC will be modeled as a declining percentage of revenue, starting at **11.0% in Year 1 and decreasing to 7.0% by Year 5.**
    *   **Assumption (Shares):** A net **1.5% annual reduction in shares outstanding** will be modeled, balancing buybacks against SBC-related dilution.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION - REVISED**

11. **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF):**
    *   **Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital.
    *   **Justification:** This is the standard FCFF calculation. SBC is a non-cash charge already accounted for within EBIT; we will not double-count it here but will account for its dilutive effect in the share count.

*FCFF Forecast (USD, millions):*
| Year | 1 (2026) | 2 (2027) | 3 (2028) | 4 (2029) | 5 (2030) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Revenue Growth | 13.0% | 11.5% | 10.0% | 8.5% | 7.0% |
| Revenue | 13,085.4 | 14,590.2 | 16,049.2 | 17,413.4 | 18,632.4 |
| EBIT Margin | 22.5% | 23.0% | 23.5% | 23.8% | 24.0% |
| EBIT | 2,944.2 | 3,355.7 | 3,771.5 | 4,136.9 | 4,471.8 |
| NOPAT | 2,325.9 | 2,651.0 | 2,979.5 | 3,268.1 | 3,532.7 |
| (+) D&A | 130.9 | 145.9 | 160.5 | 174.1 | 186.3 |
| (-) Capex | 130.9 | 145.9 | 160.5 | 174.1 | 186.3 |
| (-) Chg in WC | -45.2 | -45.1 | -43.8 | -40.9 | -36.6 |
| **FCFF** | **2,371.1** | **2,696.1** | **3,023.3** | **3,309.0** | **3,569.3** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC) - REVISED**

12. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** Unchanged. **10.95%**.
13. **Cost of Debt:** Using a pre-tax cost of **5.5%** and a 21% tax rate, the after-tax cost is **4.35%**.
14. **WACC Calculation:** Based on the market values of equity and debt, the WACC is recalculated as **10.78%**. This rate will be used for discounting.

**F) TERMINAL VALUE - REVISED**

15. **Gordon Growth Method (Cross-Check):**
    *   *Terminal Growth Rate (g):* **3.0%**. A slightly higher but reasonable long-term growth rate, reflecting global nominal GDP growth and inflation.
    *   *Terminal Value (TV) = [$3,569.3 * (1 + 0.03)] / (0.1078 - 0.03) = **$47,151 million**

16. **Exit Multiple Method (Primary Method):**
    *   *Year 5 EBITDA:* $4,471.8M (EBIT) + $186.3M (D&A) = **$4,658.1 million**
    *   *Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple:* $47,151M / $4,658.1M = **10.1x**.
    *   *Reasoning:* A 10.1x multiple is too low for a company with Airbnb's brand moat, network effects, and asset-light, high-margin business model at maturity. Peers and comparable high-quality platform businesses often trade in a 13x-16x range. A more realistic terminal multiple that reflects its superior market position is appropriate.
    *   **Chosen Assumption:** A **14.0x EV/EBITDA exit multiple**. This is a realistic assumption for a market leader transitioning from high growth to mature growth.
    *   *Revised Terminal Value (Exit Multiple)*: $4,658.1M * 14.0 = **$65,213 million**.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE - REVISED**

17. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   *PV of Explicit FCFF:* ($2,371.1 / 1.1078^1) + ($2,696.1 / 1.1078^2) + ($3,023.3 / 1.1078^3) + ($3,309.0 / 1.1078^4) + ($3,569.3 / 1.1078^5) = $2,140 + $2,192 + $2,223 + $2,225 + $2,143 = **$10,923 million**
    *   *PV of Terminal Value:* $65,213 million / (1.1078^5) = **$39,158 million**
    *   *Enterprise Value = $10,923 million + $39,158 million = **$50,081 million***

18. **Equity Value:**
    *   *Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
    *   *Net Debt = $2,282M (Debt) - $7,402M (Cash) = -$5,120 million*
    *   *Equity Value = $50,081 million - (-$5,120 million) = **$55,201 million***

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY - REVISED**

19. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Projected Year 5 Shares Outstanding:* 634M * (1 - 0.015)^5 = **588 million**
    *   *Fair Value Per Share = $55,201 million / 588 million = **$93.88***

20. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$93.88**.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** (Slower growth to 9% tapering, 22% terminal margin, 12x exit multiple) -> **~$72 per share**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** (Faster growth to 16% tapering, 25% terminal margin, 15x exit multiple) -> **~$120 per share**.

21. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety below the base-case estimate provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   *MOS Price = $93.88 * (1 - 0.30) = **$65.72***

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory Risk:** The most significant risk is from municipal and national governments. New regulations, zoning laws, or taxes targeting short-term rentals could severely impact inventory and demand.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** Intense competition from established hotel chains (e.g., Marriott, Hilton) and other online travel agencies (e.g., Booking.com, Expedia) could pressure take rates and growth.
3.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a travel and leisure company, Airbnb is highly susceptible to economic downturns, which reduce discretionary spending on travel.
4.  **Brand and Safety Incidents:** High-profile safety incidents or a failure to maintain host and guest trust could cause irreparable damage to the brand and user confidence.
5.  **Dependence on Hosts:** Airbnb's success is contingent on its ability to attract and retain hosts. Any shift in host sentiment or a move to competing platforms could limit supply.

final answer is 93.88 $
