Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed: Carriage Services, Inc., August 22, 2025, search results of Q1 and Q2 2025 earnings call summaries and news articles. Direct access to SEC filings and transcripts was unsuccessful.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The death care industry is a mature market that grows in line with population and demographic trends. Carriage Services' primary growth vector is through the consolidation of a fragmented market. The company has announced pending acquisitions that are expected to contribute over $15 million in revenue. Additionally, Carriage Services is pursuing organic growth through initiatives like preneed insurance sales, which increased financial revenue by 9.1% in the first quarter of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has signaled a renewed focus on growth through acquisitions. Internally, the company is investing in process improvements, such as "Project Trinity," a new back-office system, and has introduced a new line of caskets to enhance profit margins. A new partnership with Express Funeral Funding is intended to streamline insurance assignment processing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a provider of death care services, traditional research and development is not a major component of Carriage Services' business model. The company does invest in technology and process improvements, such as the $800,000 invested in "Project Trinity" in the first quarter of 2025. The long-term return on this investment is not yet clear.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's preneed insurance sales have shown strong growth, with financial revenue up 9.1% in the first quarter of 2025 and 18.8% in the second quarter. Management has credited the success of their sales teams for these results. However, a more detailed assessment is not possible without further information on sales productivity and comparisons to competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's profit margins have been under pressure. In the second quarter of 2025, Carriage Services reported margin compression in both its Funeral and Cemetery segments. The operating EBITDA margin for the Funeral segment declined to 37.0% from 39.5%, and the Cemetery segment's margin fell to 44.9% from 49.7%. Despite this, the company has reported strong growth in GAAP net income and diluted EPS.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carriage Services is actively working to improve its profit margins. The company has introduced a new line of caskets to improve procurement costs and margins. "Project Trinity" is expected to create efficiencies and reduce costs. The company has also been focused on reducing its debt, which will lower interest expenses and improve net profit margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is insufficient information available from the provided search results to make an assessment of the company's labor and personnel relations. The company has a "Managing Partners Forum" to develop its leaders.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is not enough information available from the search results to evaluate the company's executive relations, including board stability and succession planning.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The earnings call transcripts identify a senior leadership team consisting of a CEO & Vice Chairman, a CFO, and a President. However, the available information does not provide sufficient detail to assess the depth of the management team beyond these key executives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carriage Services provides detailed financial reporting, including revenue and margin breakdowns by segment. The company's investment in "Project Trinity" indicates a focus on enhancing its back-office systems and controls. The company also reports non-GAAP financial measures with reconciliations. A thorough evaluation would require a review of the company's full financial statements.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the death care industry, a key differentiator is the ability to successfully acquire and integrate smaller, independent operators. Carriage Services has a demonstrated history as a consolidator and is actively pursuing this strategy. The company's emphasis on preneed sales is another important competitive factor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investments in "Project Trinity" and leadership development suggest a long-term perspective. After a period of focusing on debt reduction, the company is now "back to growth mode" with a focus on acquisitions. This indicates a strategy of building a larger, more profitable business over the long term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carriage Services has made significant progress in strengthening its balance sheet, having paid down over $100 million in debt. This has resulted in an improved leverage ratio of 4.2x, down from 4.6x. The company appears to be in a good position to fund its growth plans without needing to issue new equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has been transparent with investors, openly discussing both the positive and negative aspects of its performance in the second quarter of 2025, including the challenges of flat revenue and margin compression. The company provides full-year revenue guidance and regularly holds earnings calls with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The search results do not contain any information to suggest a lack of integrity on the part of management. However, a definitive conclusion would require a more in-depth review of the company's public filings.
**Answer:** No

---
**Synthesis:**

Carriage Services is a disciplined consolidator in the mature death care industry. The company's primary strengths are its proven acquisition strategy, a commitment to long-term growth through internal investments, and transparent investor communications. After a period of deleveraging, the company is now focused on growth. The most significant variables that could impact the score in the next one to two years are the successful integration of its new acquisitions, the ability to realize cost savings from its "Project Trinity" initiative, and a return to margin growth. To turn a "No" into a "Yes" for several of the points, a more detailed analysis of the company's SEC filings would be necessary to gain deeper insights into the company's operations, sales organization, and management.
