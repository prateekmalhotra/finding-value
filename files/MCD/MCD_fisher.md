**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's "Accelerating the Arches" growth strategy includes a significant focus on restaurant development, with a goal of reaching 50,000 restaurants globally by the end of 2027, representing the fastest period of growth in the company's history. The company also sees significant growth potential in its chicken and coffee offerings. The global fast-food market is mature but fragmented, and McDonald's has been gaining market share, indicating a long runway for growth.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a primarily franchised business, McDonald's sales organization is its global network of franchisees. The company's heavily franchised model is designed to generate stable and predictable revenue. McDonald's provides significant support to its franchisees through its global brand, operating system, and financial resources. The company's consistent global growth and market share gains are a testament to the effectiveness of its franchise system.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's has exceptionally high profit margins for the restaurant industry. Its operating margin was 45.2% in 2024, significantly higher than its competitors and even some major technology companies. This high profitability is a direct result of its heavily franchised business model, which generates high-margin royalty and rental income.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's is focused on maintaining and improving margins through its "Accelerating the Arches" strategy, which emphasizes operational efficiency and cost controls. The company is investing in technology to create a more efficient restaurant operating platform and is also focused on supply chain management to mitigate inflationary pressures. To drive traffic, McDonald's has introduced value offerings, such as a "$5 meal deal," and is subsidizing franchisees to support these promotions.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's emphasizes its commitment to a "safe and respectful workplace" and has "Global Brand Standards" for employee well-being. The company invests in employee training and development and offers benefits and flexible work arrangements. However, there is a lack of publicly available, verifiable data on key metrics like employee turnover and satisfaction scores from independent sources.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's has a well-established and effective succession planning process, famously demonstrated by its seamless leadership transitions after the unexpected deaths of two CEOs in the early 2000s. The company has a philosophy of grooming at least two potential successors for each key leadership role. Recent executive changes have been strategic and planned, with a preference for internal promotions.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K lists a comprehensive executive team with leaders dedicated to key functions such as Global Business Services, International Markets, and a Global Chief Restaurant Experience Officer. Many of these executives have long tenures at McDonald's, indicating a strong internal talent pipeline and deep institutional knowledge. The company's well-regarded succession planning process further supports the idea of a deep management bench.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's 10-K provides detailed, audited financial statements with a clear breakdown of costs and revenues by segment. The company has a strong focus on cost management, which is evident in its high profit margins and its strategies for supply chain efficiency and labor optimization. The auditor's opinion on the financial statements is unqualified, indicating no material weaknesses in its accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's has several key competitive advantages. Its real estate strategy, where it owns a large portion of its restaurant sites, provides a significant and stable high-margin revenue stream. The company's immense scale gives it a cost advantage in purchasing and advertising. Its globally recognized brand is a powerful asset, and its extensive network of drive-thrus provides a significant convenience advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's "Accelerating the Arches" growth strategy is a multi-year plan focused on long-term growth through technology, restaurant development, and brand building. The company's significant investments in its loyalty program, digital ordering, and delivery capabilities, along with its ambitious restaurant expansion plans, demonstrate a clear focus on the long term. The 10-K provides a "Long-Term Outlook" with targets through 2027, further evidence of a long-range perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390825000012/mcd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390825000012/mcd-20241231.htm) (February 22, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** McDonald's generates substantial cash flow from operations ($9.4 billion in 2024) and has a long history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, not issuing new equity. The company has an investment-grade credit rating, providing easy access to debt markets if necessary. The risk of equity dilution is extremely low.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390825000012/mcd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390825000012/mcd-20241231.htm) (February 22, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q1 2025 earnings call, McDonald's management openly discussed challenges, including the impact of consumer pressures on sales and the complexities of implementing its value strategy. They also provided a detailed outlook and answered analyst questions directly. This transparency in the face of mixed results suggests a culture of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of recent, significant legal or regulatory issues, governance concerns, or executive scandals that would call into question the integrity of McDonald's management. The company has a comprehensive "Standards of Business Conduct" policy and a clear governance structure. While any large global company will face some litigation, there are no red flags to suggest a lack of integrity at the leadership level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390825000012/mcd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/63908/000006390825000012/mcd-20241231.htm) (February 22, 2025)

**Synthesis**

McDonald's scores very highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its status as a well-managed, highly profitable, and resilient business. The company's strongest positives are its powerful brand, its unique and profitable real estate strategy, and its highly efficient, cash-generating franchise model. The "Accelerating the Arches" strategy provides a clear roadmap for future growth, with a strong focus on technology and restaurant expansion. The only "No" in this analysis is due to a lack of verifiable, independent data on employee satisfaction and labor relations.

Over the next 12-24 months, the key variables that could change this score are the success of the company's value strategy in driving customer traffic and the execution of its ambitious restaurant expansion plan. To turn the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes," McDonald's would need to provide more transparent data on employee turnover, satisfaction, and engagement, ideally from a third-party source.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
