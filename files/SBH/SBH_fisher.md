Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. (SBH), August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K for FY24, 10-Q for Q1-Q3 2025), and Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sally Beauty Holdings operates in the large and resilient professional beauty products industry. The company's growth strategy involves expanding its high-margin owned and exclusive brand portfolio, which now constitutes 55% of Sally Beauty's sales, and growing its global e-commerce platform. However, recent performance shows consolidated same-store sales have been flat to slightly down, and the company is experiencing challenges with store traffic and a "challenging operating environment," as noted in its latest quarterly filing. While the market itself is stable, the company's ability to capture significant growth is not clearly demonstrated by recent results.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively executing a strategic plan focused on key pillars: enhancing customer centricity, growing high-margin owned and exclusive brands, and advancing digital capabilities. In the third quarter of 2025, the company highlighted the rollout of a new mobile app and expanded delivery options like 2-hour delivery and Ship-from-Store. They also continue to launch new products under their own brands, such as the recent expansion of the BondBar line. This demonstrates a clear commitment to evolving its service and product mix.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sally Beauty Holdings does not explicitly disclose its Research & Development expenses in its financial statements, suggesting the amount is not material. The company's innovation is focused on product development for its owned brands rather than fundamental R&D. While the growth of owned brands to 55% of sales indicates success in this area, the lack of specific R&D metrics makes it impossible to benchmark its effectiveness against its size or competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates through two distinct channels: the Sally Beauty Supply retail stores for retail customers and salon professionals, and the Beauty Systems Group (BSG) for professional-only sales. While the omni-channel platform with features like a new app and expanded delivery options is a strength, recent results show weakness. For the third quarter of 2025, Sally Beauty segment same-store sales declined by 0.3% and the BSG segment was down 2.1%. This performance does not indicate an "above-average" sales organization in the current environment.
**Answer:** No

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For its fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, Sally Beauty reported a gross margin of 40.3% and an operating margin of 7.9%. In its most recent quarter (Q3 2025), the consolidated gross margin was 40.2% and the GAAP operating margin was 7.5%. While these margins have shown slight compression due to cost pressures, they remain substantial for a specialty retailer, supported by the high mix of owned brands.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin through its Fuel for Growth program, targeting cost savings and efficiencies. Key initiatives include optimizing the supply chain, growing the high-margin owned and exclusive brand portfolio, and leveraging technology to enhance productivity. In their Q3 2025 earnings call, they specifically noted that a higher mix of owned brands and supply chain savings helped offset product cost inflation, keeping gross margins relatively stable.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of September 30, 2024, Sally Beauty had approximately 28,000 employees. The company's 10-K report details its human capital strategy, focusing on attracting, developing, and retaining talent with competitive wages and benefits, and fostering a culture of diversity, equity, and inclusion. There are no recent, widespread reports of significant labor disputes or unionization drives. The evidence suggests stable, not necessarily "outstanding," labor relations.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, led by CEO Denise Paulonis since 2021, appears stable. The company's latest proxy statement outlines executive compensation policies designed to align pay with performance, including long-term equity awards. There is no public evidence of significant boardroom friction or infighting. This suggests a functional and stable executive environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**
 General corporate governance information available through investor relations and proxy statements. The provided links do not include the definitive proxy statement, but the absence of negative reporting supports this conclusion.

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership team, detailed on its investor relations website, includes seasoned executives heading key functions like finance, supply chain, merchandising, and its principal operating segments (Sally Beauty and BSG). This structure suggests a professional management layer below the CEO. The company has navigated a CEO transition in recent years and continues to execute its strategic plans, indicating sufficient management depth to run the business.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's Form 10-K for fiscal year 2024 contains an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP. Management's report on internal control over financial reporting also concluded that these controls were effective as of September 30, 2024. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator in specialty beauty retail is the relationship with the professional stylist community and exclusive products. Sally Beauty's BSG segment, with its direct sales force and professional-only stores, creates a competitive moat. Furthermore, the portfolio of owned and exclusive-to-SBH brands (now 55% of sales) provides a significant advantage over competitors that primarily sell third-party products, as it drives customer loyalty and higher margins.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is investing in strategic initiatives like its digital transformation, supply chain optimization, and store remodels, which are aimed at long-term health. However, the company is also highly focused on near-term performance, managing inventory tightly and executing its "Fuel for Growth" cost-savings plan to support current-year earnings and cash flow. The outlook appears balanced, but the intense focus on cost savings in a challenging environment suggests short-term profitability is a very high priority.
**Answer:** No

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, the company had $91 million in cash and cash equivalents and $1.05 billion in total debt. The company generates consistent cash flow from operations ($218 million in the nine months ended June 30, 2025). It also actively returns capital to shareholders via share repurchases ($75 million in the same period), signaling confidence that it does not need to issue equity. The financial position appears sufficient to fund operations and investments without dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its quarterly earnings calls, management openly discusses the challenges it faces. For instance, in the Q3 2025 call, they directly addressed the "challenging operating environment," negative traffic trends, and the specific performance issues within the BSG segment. They provide specific details on segment performance and are forthcoming about headwinds, which demonstrates a healthy level of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings reveals no material legal proceedings that would question management's integrity. The "Legal Proceedings" section of its recent 10-Q and 10-K filings state that the company is involved in routine litigation incidental to its business, but nothing that appears to be a major red flag. There are no significant related-party transactions or governance issues disclosed.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Sally Beauty Holdings presents a mixed profile against Fisher's checklist. The company's strongest positives are its solid profit margins, driven by a high mix of exclusive brands which form a competitive moat, and sound corporate governance demonstrated by its financial controls, investor candor, and management integrity. However, its score is significantly held back by a lack of demonstrable top-line growth, with recent sales figures failing to prove the company can capture the potential of its end markets. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of its strategic initiatives. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on "Products/Services with Long Runway" and "Above-Average Sales Organization" would require sustained positive same-store sales growth, proving its digital and product strategies are gaining traction with consumers and stylists in a competitive environment.

fisher score is 10 / 15
