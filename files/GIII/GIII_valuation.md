### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**
The following guidance was provided for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2026:
*   **Net Sales:** "Net sales are expected to be approximately $3.14 billion." (Press Release, March 13, 2025).
*   **Net Income:** "Net income is expected to be between $192.0 million and $197.0 million." (Press Release, March 13, 2025).

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**
*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1 (FY2026):** Revenue is projected at **$3,140 million**, the midpoint of management's guidance, representing a -1.3% decline from FY2025. This reflects the initial impact of the wind-down of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses.
    *   **Years 2-5:** A conservative growth rate of **1.0%** is assumed. This reflects a modest growth in owned brands (DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld) and new licenses, largely offset by the continued, staggered expiration of the significant Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses through 2027. This aligns with a realism-grounded approach.
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin):**
    *   The FY2025 adjusted EBIT margin was approximately 9.2%. Management's FY2026 guidance implies a net margin of ~6.2%. To be conservative, the operating margin is modeled at **8.5%** through the forecast period, slightly below the FY2025 level to account for potential deleveraging as high-margin licensed sales decline.
*   **Tax Rate:**
    *   The effective tax rate for FY2025 was 28.4% ($76.6M / $269.9M). A rate of **28.0%** is used for the forecast period.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** The 3-year average capex as a percentage of sales (FY23-FY25) was 1.1%. Capex is modeled at **1.2% of revenue** going forward.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** The 3-year average change in working capital as a percentage of the change in sales was volatile. For this model, it is estimated at **5.0% of incremental revenue**, a common assumption for a stable apparel business.
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):**
    *   The 3-year average SBC as a percentage of sales was 0.8%. SBC is modeled as **0.8% of revenue**.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD, in millions) | Y1 (FY26) | Y2 (FY27) | Y3 (FY28) | Y4 (FY29) | Y5 (FY30) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,140.0 | $3,171.4 | $3,203.1 | $3,235.1 | $3,267.5 |
| EBIT (8.5% margin) | $266.9 | $269.6 | $272.3 | $275.0 | $277.7 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.30%** (Source: US 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   **Beta:** **1.47** (Source: Finbox, 5-Year Beta). This reflects the stock's historical volatility relative to the market over a multi-year period, suitable for a long-term valuation.
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.0%**. This is a standard, widely-used premium for the U.S. market.
    *   **Cost of Equity =** 4.30% + 1.47 * 5.0% = **11.65%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** `Interest Expense / Total Debt`
    *   Calculation: $18.8M / $6.2M = Not meaningful due to low debt levels. The company's debt is minimal. We will use a proxy based on the risk-free rate plus a credit spread. A rate of **6.0%** pre-tax is assumed.
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 6.0% * (1 - 28.0%) = **4.32%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)`
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): **$1,120 million** (Source: Stock Analysis, August 20, 2025).
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): **$6.2 million** (from baseline financials).
    *   **WACC =** ($1,120 / $1,126.2) * 11.65% + ($6.2 / $1,126.2) * 4.32% = **11.59%**

### **F) Terminal Value**
*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%**. This is a conservative rate, below long-run inflation expectations, reflecting a mature company in a competitive industry.
    *   **Terminal Value =** $160.4 * (1 + 0.02) / (0.1159 - 0.02) = **$1,705.5 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = EBITDA_Year5 * Exit Multiple`
    *   EBITDA_Year5 = EBIT + D&A = $277.7M + $27.4M = $305.1M
    *   **Exit Multiple:** **5.7x**. This is the company's median 5-year historical EV/EBITDA multiple.
    *   **Terminal Value =** $305.1M * 5.7 = **$1,739.1 million**
*   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple methods yield similar results. The more conservative **$1,705.5 million** from the Gordon Growth method will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
*   **Enterprise Value Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `Enterprise Value = PV(FCFFs) + PV(Terminal Value)`
    *   PV of Explicit FCFFs = $158.8/(1.1159)^1 + $156.4/(1.1159)^2 + $157.8/(1.1159)^3 + $159.1/(1.1159)^4 + $160.4/(1.1159)^5 = $142.3 + $125.7 + $113.8 + $102.8 + $93.0 = **$577.6 million**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $1,705.5 / (1.1159)^5 = **$988.3 million**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $577.6 million + $988.3 million = $1,565.9 million**
*   **Equity Value Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $6.2M - $181.4M = **-$175.2 million** (Net Cash)
    *   **Equity Value = $1,565.9 million - (-$175.2 million) = $1,741.1 million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   Fair Value = $1,741.1 million / 46.1 million shares = **$37.77 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$37.77**. Based on the assumptions outlined above.
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($27):** Assumes a lower revenue growth of 0% post-guidance and a lower terminal growth rate of 1.5%, reflecting difficulty in replacing licensed revenue.
    *   **High/Bull Case ($48):** Assumes a higher revenue growth of 2.5% post-guidance and a higher terminal growth rate of 2.5%, reflecting strong performance from owned brands and new licenses.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **Formula:** `MOS Price = Base-Case Value * (1 - MOS %)`
    *   Using a **30%** MOS: $37.77 * (1 - 0.30) = **$26.44**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **License Transition Risk:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the company's ability to replace the revenue and profit from the expiring Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses. Failure to do so represents the single largest risk to the base case.
2.  **Margin Pressure:** The apparel industry is highly competitive. Increased promotional activity or rising input costs could compress operating margins below the 8.5% assumption.
3.  **Consumer Spending:** As a seller of discretionary goods, G-III is exposed to downturns in consumer spending, which could negatively impact revenue growth assumptions.
4.  **Brand Execution:** The success of the owned-brand strategy (DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld) is critical. Any missteps in design, marketing, or distribution could impair the growth needed to offset license losses.

final answer is 37.77 $
