SITE Centers Corp., August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K (filed February 21, 2025), Form 10-Q (filed May 7, 2025), and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (July 30, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SITE Centers owns and manages open-air shopping centers in suburban, high-income communities. Following its October 1, 2024, spin-off of Curbline Properties, the company has focused its portfolio on this specific niche, which is benefiting from post-pandemic trends like remote work and population growth in the suburbs. The company's strategy is to increase rental revenue through continued lease-up of its portfolio and rental rate increases. As of December 31, 2024, the portfolio was 90.6% occupied, indicating room for growth. Management commentary from July 2024 noted that retail is in a "euphoric moment" with high tenant demand and growing rents, supporting the potential for sales growth within its focused portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment is demonstrated through aggressive portfolio reshaping rather than traditional ground-up development. The company's stated strategy involves realizing value through operations and pursuing asset sales to refine its portfolio. This includes "tactical redevelopment activities and other asset management initiatives intended to maximize value." For example, in May 2024, the company acquired its joint venture partner's 80% interest in two North Carolina properties to gain full control and optimize their performance. This active management and repositioning approach represents a commitment to increasing the sales potential of its core assets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a real estate investment trust, SITE Centers does not have a formal Research and Development (R&D) department analogous to a technology or pharmaceutical company. While the company uses data analytics for leasing and to understand consumer traffic, these activities are considered part of its core operations, not distinct R&D efforts. The company's filings do not disclose any specific budget or personnel dedicated to R&D, preventing any meaningful comparison to its size or peers.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In SITE Centers' context, the "sales organization" is its leasing team. The team's effectiveness is demonstrated by strong leasing metrics. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company signed new leases and renewals for approximately 0.7 million square feet and achieved positive blended cash leasing spreads of 7.8% on a pro-rata basis. The aggregate portfolio occupancy stood at a healthy 90.6% at year-end 2024. These results, achieved during a significant portfolio transformation, indicate an effective and above-average leasing organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a REIT, Net Operating Income (NOI) is a key indicator of profitability. While the spin-off and asset sales make year-over-year comparisons of net income complex, the underlying portfolio demonstrates solid margins. For the three months ended March 31, 2024, the company generated $91.7 million in rental income against $28.7 million in property-level operating and real estate tax expenses, indicating a strong property-level operating margin. The company's strategy to focus on high-income suburban locations is designed to maintain and grow these margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025065759/sitc-20250331.htm (May 7, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has undertaken a significant strategic overhaul to improve its margin profile. Between July 2023 and December 2024, SITC generated $3.1 billion from property sales to repay all outstanding unsecured debt and preferred shares. This deleveraging dramatically reduces interest expense, a major cost. By focusing on a smaller portfolio of higher-quality assets, management aims to improve operational efficiency and pricing power. The company is also focused on leasing up its remaining vacancy, which would directly improve property-level NOI margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025065759/sitc-20250331.htm (May 7, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K filing provides positive indicators of its human capital management. As of December 31, 2024, the company noted that many of its employees have a long tenure, with approximately 83% having been with the company for over 5 years and 60% for over 10 years. The company highlights a focus on wellness, flexible work arrangements, and a culture underpinned by core values. This high level of employee retention is strong evidence of positive personnel relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a clear track record. David R. Lukes has served as President and CEO since March 2017. The company recently hired a new CFO, Gerald Morgan, in October 2024, who brings extensive public REIT experience. The executive team successfully executed the complex spin-off of Curbline Properties, a major strategic initiative that requires significant internal coordination and alignment. The provision of leadership services to the new entity, Curbline, via a shared services agreement, further indicates a cohesive and trusted executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SITE Centers has a well-defined senior executive team beyond the CEO. The 2024 10-K lists David R. Lukes (CEO), Gerald Morgan (CFO), John M. Cattonar (CIO), and Aaron M. Kitlowski (General Counsel). Each executive has substantial experience in the real estate and REIT industry, indicating a professional and deep management bench capable of running the business and executing complex transactions like the recent spin-off and large-scale asset sales.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The report also states that the company "maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024." Furthermore, the "Controls and Procedures" section of the Q1 2025 10-Q confirms management's evaluation that disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025065759/sitc-20250331.htm (May 7, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive clue for a retail REIT is its location strategy. SITE Centers' stated mission is to "own and manage open-air shopping centers primarily located in suburban, high household income communities." This specific focus allows it to attract high-quality, creditworthy national retailers and cater to a resilient consumer demographic. By concentrating on this niche and actively divesting non-core assets, the company differentiates itself from competitors with more varied or lower-quality portfolios, positioning it to capitalize on favorable demographic trends.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The spin-off of Curbline Properties is prime evidence of a long-range outlook. This move significantly reduced the company's size and near-term rental income in order to create a more focused, higher-quality portfolio positioned for long-term growth. The company explicitly states its strategy is to "realize value through operations and to consider various factors... in evaluating whether and when to pursue additional asset sales," prioritizing portfolio quality over sheer size. This willingness to undergo a massive, dilutive-in-the-short-term transformation for a better long-term strategic position is a clear indicator of a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm (February 21, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a clear strategy of funding its operations and capital needs through asset sales and secured debt, rather than dilutive equity issuance. From mid-2023 to year-end 2024, the company used proceeds from $3.1 billion in asset sales and a new $530 million mortgage facility to completely repay its unsecured notes and preferred stock. In May 2024, the company terminated its "at the market" continuous equity program, signaling a move away from issuing new shares. As of December 31, 2024, the company had a strong liquidity position with $54.6 million in unrestricted cash and a de-risked balance sheet.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Review of the Q1 2024 earnings call transcript from April 30, 2024, which occurred during a period of immense strategic change, demonstrates management's candor. Management openly discussed the complexities of the then-pending spin-off, the significant volume of asset sales, and the resulting impact on the company's financial metrics. They directly addressed analyst questions regarding the rationale for the spin, the nature of the assets being sold, and the future dividend policy, providing detailed, transparent answers rather than evasive responses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SITC/transcripts/ (April 30, 2024)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings and a search for public records show no significant red flags regarding management integrity. The 2024 10-K's "Legal Proceedings" section states that the company is subject to various proceedings that "are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company." There is no indication of major fraud, regulatory sanctions, or material legal issues involving the named executive officers. The company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and senior financial officers must certify compliance with a specific Code of Ethics annually.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**

SITE Centers Corp. scores well on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a company that has successfully executed a dramatic and decisive strategic transformation. The company's strongest positives are its clear, disciplined strategy focusing on high-quality suburban shopping centers, a significantly de-risked balance sheet following aggressive asset sales and debt repayment, and a stable, experienced management team that communicates with candor. The primary negative, if any, is the inherent lack of traditional R&D, which is typical for the REIT industry. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months hinge on the execution of the post-spin-off strategy. Specifically, the score could be impacted by: 1) the company's ability to maintain leasing momentum and drive NOI growth in its now more concentrated portfolio, and 2) its discipline in future capital allocation, particularly how it uses proceeds from any further asset sales. Evidence of faltering occupancy rates or a value-destroying acquisition would be the most likely factors to flip a "Yes" to a "No".
