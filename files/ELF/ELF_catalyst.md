### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** International Expansion Acceleration

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** e.l.f. Beauty is aggressively expanding its international presence, with a focus on Europe and Mexico. The company is partnering with major retailers like Rossmann in Germany and Sephora in Mexico, and is also expanding its footprint in existing markets like the UK and Italy.
*   **Mechanism:** Increased international sales will drive top-line revenue growth and diversify revenue streams, reducing dependence on the U.S. market. This growth, if profitable, will increase earnings and free cash flow, leading to a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** International sales grow by 20% in the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:** International sales grow by 30% in the next 12 months, in line with Q1 2026 growth.
    *   **High Scenario:** International sales grow by 40% in the next 12 months, driven by successful new market entries and deeper penetration in existing ones.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 15-35%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85% - The company has a demonstrated track record of successful international expansion and has announced concrete plans for further growth.

*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, with a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $100 million of stock in the next 12 months.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. International Expansion Acceleration:**

*   **Formula:** Change in Stock Price = (% Change in International Sales * International Sales Contribution to Total Revenue * P/S Multiple) / Market Capitalization
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   International Sales Contribution to Total Revenue: 20%
    *   P/S Multiple: 10x
    *   Market Capitalization: $7.73 billion
*   **Base Scenario (30% international sales growth):**
    *   (0.30 * 0.20 * 10 * $980.9 million) / $7.73 billion = **7.6% increase in stock price**

**2. Share Repurchase Program Execution:**

*   **Formula:** % Change in EPS = (Amount of Repurchase / Market Capitalization) / (1 - (Amount of Repurchase / Market Capitalization))
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Market Capitalization: $7.73 billion
*   **Base Scenario ($250 million repurchase):**
    *   ($250 million / $7.73 billion) / (1 - ($250 million / $7.73 billion)) = **3.3% increase in EPS**, which should translate to a similar increase in stock price, all else being equal.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for e.l.f. Beauty are overwhelmingly positive. The aggressive and successful international expansion provides a clear path to significant top-line growth, while the share repurchase program offers a direct return of value to shareholders.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A significant and prolonged global economic downturn:** This would reduce consumer discretionary spending, impacting sales across all of e.l.f.'s markets and brands.
2.  **A major supply chain disruption:** As e.l.f. still relies heavily on manufacturing in China, any geopolitical events, trade disputes, or logistical challenges could severely impact its ability to get products to market.
3.  **A significant product safety or quality issue:** This could lead to a loss of consumer trust, product recalls, and damage to the e.l.f. brand, which would be difficult to recover from.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

e.l.f. Beauty presents a compelling investment case driven by its aggressive and successful international expansion, which is the top catalyst for near-term growth. The company's demonstrated ability to enter new markets and gain market share, coupled with the direct value return from its share repurchase program, provides a clear path to upside. The most important indicator to monitor is the company's quarterly international sales growth, which will be the primary driver of the expected 15-35% upside in the stock price.
