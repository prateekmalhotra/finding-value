Of course. Here is a revised and improved valuation of The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, addressing the issues in the original analysis while maintaining the requested format and detail.

The primary flaws identified in the original valuation were:
1.  **Declining Free Cash Flow:** The forecast showed FCFF declining each year despite revenue growth. This was caused by an unrealistic capex assumption (growing as a % of a growing revenue base) that outpaced NOPAT growth. A mature company's cash flow should be stable or growing, not perpetually shrinking.
2.  **Overly Conservative Growth:** A 1.0% revenue growth assumption may be too pessimistic, ignoring any potential for recovery or market stabilization.
3.  **Static Margin Assumption:** The model ignored the potential impact, even if modest, of the company's significant "Goodyear Forward" restructuring plan, which explicitly targets margin improvement.
4.  **Terminal Value Method:** For a mature, cyclical, and capital-intensive business, an Exit Multiple based on historical/peer averages is often a more reliable and market-grounded method for calculating terminal value than the Gordon Growth model, which is highly sensitive to small changes in WACC and the growth rate.
5.  **Cost of Debt:** The calculation used the *effective* interest rate, which is backward-looking. A forward-looking DCF should use the *marginal* cost of new debt, which is better estimated by looking at the yields on the company's existing long-term bonds or peers with similar credit ratings.

The following analysis corrects these flaws to provide a more realistic valuation.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$8.65** per share (as of August 22, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months ending June 30, 2025):**

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source & Notes |

| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 289 | (Calculated from Market Cap / Price) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions priced into the stock, we solve for the revenue growth rate that results in a DCF value equal to the current market price of $8.65.

*   **WACC Calculation (for Market View):**
    *   Cost of Equity (CAPM): 4.26% (Risk-Free Rate) + 1.35 (Beta) \* 5.5% (Equity Risk Premium) = **11.69%**
    *   Cost of Debt (after-tax): (515 / 8,978) * (1 - 21%) = 5.73% * 0.79 = **4.53%**
    *   WACC = (2.5B / (2.5B + 8.2B)) * 11.69% + (8.2B / (2.5B + 8.2B)) * 4.53% = **6.25%**
*   **Terminal Value Assumption:** A perpetual growth rate of 2.5% is used.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**

To justify the **$8.65** stock price, the market must believe Goodyear can achieve a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 3.5%** while maintaining its TTM **EBIT margin of 4.1%**. This implies a belief in modest but steady top-line growth and a stabilization of profitability at current levels.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on revised, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The market's implied growth seems achievable, but the original analyst case was overly pessimistic. This revised case models a more realistic scenario: modest top-line recovery, partial success from restructuring efforts, and rationalized capital spending.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1â€“5:**
    *   **Assumption:** Revenue will grow at **2.0% annually** for the next five years.
    *   **Justification:** This rate is more realistic than 1.0%. It reflects long-term industry growth that is typically aligned with inflation and slow global economic expansion. It acknowledges the maturity of the market without being overly optimistic, balancing competitive pressures with stable replacement tire demand.

8.  **Margin Path:**
    *   **Assumption:** EBIT margin will expand gradually from **4.1% in Year 1 to 4.8% by Year 5**.
    *   **Justification:** A static margin is too conservative as it ignores the company's "Goodyear Forward" restructuring plan. This assumption models partial success, where Goodyear captures some, but not all, of its targeted cost savings and operational efficiencies. A 70 basis point expansion over five years is a measured and realistic forecast.

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Assumption:** An effective tax rate of **21.0%**.
    *   **Justification:** This is the standard U.S. corporate tax rate and serves as a normalized rate for forecasting.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed to be **110% of D&A**. This is a common and more stable approach for a mature industrial company. It covers maintenance capex (equal to D&A) plus a small allowance for inflation and minor growth projects. This equates to ~$991M annually.
    *   **Working Capital:** Change in working capital is modeled as **3.0% of the change in revenue**. This is a more normalized historical average and prevents the excessive cash drain seen in the prior model.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Treated as a cash expense and projected at **$50 million annually**.
    *   **Share Count:** The diluted share count will remain **flat at 289 million shares**, assuming dilution from SBC is offset by minor repurchases.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital.

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**

| Fiscal Year | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $18,870 | $19,247 | $19,632 | $20,025 | $20,426 |
| EBIT Margin | 4.10% | 4.28% | 4.45% | 4.63% | 4.80% |
| EBIT | $774 | $823 | $874 | $927 | $980 |
| NOPAT | $611 | $650 | $690 | $732 | $775 |
| D&A | $901 | $901 | $901 | $901 | $901 |
| Capex (110% of D&A) | ($991) | ($991) | ($991) | ($991) | ($991) |
| Change in WC | ($11) | ($11) | ($12) | ($12) | ($12) |
| SBC | ($50) | ($50) | ($50) | ($50) | ($50) |
| **FCFF** | **$460** | **$499** | **$538** | **$580** | **$623** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (Source: US 10-Year Treasury Yield, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.5%** (Standard market premium)
    *   Beta: **1.35** (Source: Finbox, 5-Year Monthly Beta)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.35 * 5.5% = 11.69%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-Tax Cost of Debt: **7.00%**. This is a revised, forward-looking estimate based on yields for companies with a similar non-investment-grade credit rating (e.g., BB/Ba), which is more appropriate than the backward-looking effective rate.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 7.00% * (1 - 21.0%) = **5.53%**

16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: $2.50 Billion ($8.65/share * 289M shares)
    *   Market Value of Debt: $8.20 Billion ($8.98B Total Debt - $0.78B Cash)
    *   Total Capital: $10.70 Billion
    *   **WACC = (2.50/10.70) * 11.69% + (8.20/10.70) * 5.53% = 2.73% + 4.24% = 6.97%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Exit Multiple Method (Primary):** For a cyclical, capital-intensive company, this method is more grounded in market reality. A conservative, mid-cycle multiple is appropriate.
    *   Terminal Year EBITDA = EBIT ($980M) + D&A ($901M) = **$1,881 million**
    *   Assumed EV/EBITDA Multiple: **5.5x**. This is a realistic multiple for a mature auto supplier, reflecting its cyclicality and debt load, and is slightly more conservative than its 10-year median.
    *   **Terminal Value = $1,881M * 5.5x = $10,346 million**

18. **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   A perpetual growth rate (g) of 2.5% is used.
    *   Implied Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Implied TV = ($623M * (1.025)) / (6.97% - 2.5%) = $639M / 0.0447 = **$14,295 million**
    *   The Gordon Growth method implies a much higher valuation (an exit multiple of ~7.6x), suggesting it may be too optimistic given the risk profile. The **5.5x Exit Multiple method provides a more conservative and realistic anchor**. We will proceed with its result.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = ($460/1.0697^1) + ($499/1.0697^2) + ($538/1.0697^3) + ($580/1.0697^4) + ($623/1.0697^5) = **$2,168 million**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $10,346M / (1.0697^5) = **$7,389 million**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $2,168M + $7,389M = $9,557 million**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($8,978M) - Cash ($785M) = **$8,193 million**
    *   **Equity Value = $9,557M - $8,193M = $1,364 million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Fair Value Per Share = $1,364 million / 289 million shares = **$4.72**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $4.72**. Assumes 2.0% revenue growth and margin expansion to 4.8%.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $2.15**. Assumes 0% revenue growth and flat 4.1% EBIT margin.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $7.80**. Assumes 3.0% revenue growth and successful margin expansion to 5.5% (closer to management targets).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% margin of safety to the base-case estimate provides a target purchase price.
    *   MOS Price = $4.72 * (1 - 0.30) = **$3.30**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Cyclical Demand:** The tire industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles, impacting both new car sales (OEM demand) and miles driven (replacement demand).
2.  **Raw Material Volatility:** Key inputs like natural rubber and oil derivatives are subject to significant price swings, which can compress margins if costs cannot be passed on to consumers.
3.  **Intense Competition:** The global tire market is highly competitive, with numerous players including low-cost manufacturers, which limits pricing power.
4.  **High Capital Intensity:** The business requires significant ongoing capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade manufacturing facilities, which can strain free cash flow generation.
5.  **Debt Burden:** Goodyear operates with a substantial amount of debt, making it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and requiring a significant portion of cash flow for debt service.
