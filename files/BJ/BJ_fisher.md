Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: BJ's Fiscal Year 2024 10-K (filed March 21, 2025), Q1 2025 10-Q (filed June 6, 2025), and Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (May 23, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** BJ's operates in the U.S. warehouse club channel, which is a mature industry. However, the company is demonstrating a clear path to growth by steadily expanding its geographic footprint. The company plans to open approximately 12 new clubs in fiscal year 2025 and is targeting a long-term potential of over 500 clubs, a significant increase from the 244 clubs operated at the end of Q1 2025. This physical expansion, combined with consistent growth in membership fee income, which rose 8.6% in Q1 2025, provides a visible runway for future sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively investing in initiatives beyond simple expansion. A key focus is on enhancing digital capabilities, which has resulted in a 21% increase in digitally-enabled sales in Q1 2025. The company is also heavily investing in its private label "Own Brands," which drive loyalty and improve margins. Furthermore, BJ's is expanding its higher-margin ancillary services, such as gas stations and tire centers, at new and existing locations to drive member traffic and sales. These actions show a clear commitment to developing processes and offerings that will support future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a retailer, R&D is better measured by investments in technology, merchandising, and supply chain. BJ's does not report a formal R&D expense. However, the effectiveness of its investments can be inferred from key metrics. The 21% growth in digitally-enabled sales in Q1 2025 points to successful technology and platform development. The increasing penetration of its private-label "Own Brands" also suggests effective product development and merchandising research. While direct R&D spending figures are not available for comparison, these operational results indicate that its development efforts are productive.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In retail, the "sales organization" is the membership and marketing model. BJ's consistently grows its member base and maintains high retention. Membership fee income, a direct indicator of sales success, increased by 8.6% in Q1 2025. The company's renewal rate has been approximately 90% for the last three fiscal years, which is a strong indicator of member satisfaction and loyalty. The company is also seeing success in its higher-tier "Club+" membership, which further drives loyalty and fee income. This consistent performance points to an effective sales and retention strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a warehouse club, BJ's profit margins are solid. Gross profit margin (excluding membership fees) is consistently in the 18-19% range, while merchandise gross margin was 16.9% for fiscal 2024. While merchandise margins are thin, which is typical for the industry model, the high-margin membership fee income is crucial. For Q1 2025, net income was $111.4 million on $4.92 billion in revenue, for a net margin of 2.3%. This is comparable to its larger peers and demonstrates a worthwhile, albeit narrow, margin structure for its industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025], [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000057/bj-20250503.htm) June 6, 2025]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing several avenues for margin improvement. A primary driver is the expansion of its high-margin "Own Brands," which improves the merchandise margin mix. The company is also focused on supply chain efficiencies, including investments in automation and optimizing distribution networks, to control costs. Additionally, growth in ancillary businesses, like the gasoline program, and continued growth in membership fee income directly contribute to improving overall profitability. Management's commentary in the Q1 2025 earnings call highlighted a disciplined approach to promotions and cost management as key priorities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025], [(https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BJ/transcripts/) May 23, 2025]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses that as of February 1, 2025, it had approximately 37,000 team members. The company's 10-K report details its commitment to fostering a culture of respect and providing competitive wages and benefits, including healthcare and retirement plans. There are no widespread reports of significant labor strife or unionization drives that would suggest poor relations. While detailed metrics like employee turnover are not publicly available, the absence of major negative disclosures or events provides no evidence to the contrary. However, without proactive, positive evidence of "outstanding" relations, a conservative assessment is warranted.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at BJ's appears stable and experienced. Key leaders, including CEO Bob Eddy (with the company since 2007, CEO since 2021) and COO and President Jeff Desroches (with the company since 2017), have significant tenure and industry experience. There has been no recent, unusual turnover in the senior executive ranks. This stability at the top suggests a cohesive and functional leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the CEO and President, BJ's lists a broad team of Executive Vice Presidents overseeing critical functions like Merchandising, Club Operations, and Digital. For example, the Chief Merchandising Officer, Rachael Vegas, and the Chief Digital Officer, Monica Schwartz, hold key roles essential to the company's growth strategy. This structure, with experienced leaders across various functions, indicates a strong bench of management talent beyond the top two executives, mitigating key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's fiscal 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Furthermore, management's assessment concluded that, as of February 1, 2025, the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. There were no material weaknesses identified. The company has no history of major restatements, suggesting that its accounting controls and cost analysis are robust and reliable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** BJ's successfully differentiates itself in the warehouse club industry. Unlike its larger competitors, BJ's offers a broader assortment of products in smaller, more convenient pack sizes, which appeals to smaller families and households. The company is also unique in its acceptance of manufacturers' coupons, a key differentiator for value-conscious shoppers. Strategically, its real estate footprint is focused on the Eastern U.S., allowing for strong regional density and brand recognition, which contrasts with the national scope of its primary competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes long-term strategic investments. The company's capital allocation is prioritized towards new club openings, remodels, and technology investments, which require significant upfront capital for a long-term payoff. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Bob Eddy discussed investing in member value to drive long-term loyalty and market share gains, even if it creates short-term margin pressure. This focus on reinvesting in the business for durable growth, particularly through physical expansion and digital enhancements, demonstrates a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025], [(https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BJ/transcripts/) May 23, 2025]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is in a strong financial position to fund its growth. It generated over $855 million in net cash from operations in fiscal 2024. As of May 4, 2025, the company had $35.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and access to a $1.2 billion asset-based revolving credit facility. Crucially, the company has a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, having repurchased over $150 million of stock in fiscal 2024 and $66 million in Q1 2025, demonstrating confidence in its cash flow and a commitment to avoiding dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025], [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000057/bj-20250503.htm) June 6, 2025]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's communication appears transparent and direct. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, executives addressed challenges head-on, such as the impact of lower gasoline prices on top-line sales figures and the competitive promotional environment. They provided specific details on their strategic responses and answered analyst questions directly without being evasive. This willingness to discuss both positive results (digital growth, membership) and challenges (merchandise traffic) in the same call demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BJ/transcripts/) May 23, 2025]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings reveals no material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would call management's integrity into question. The company has clean audit reports and no history of significant regulatory issues or scandals. Based on public disclosures, management appears to operate with a high standard of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000013/bj-20250201.htm) March 21, 2025], [(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1531152/000153115225000057/bj-20250503.htm) June 6, 2025]

**Synthesis:**

BJ's Wholesale Club scores highly on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting strong fundamentals in its growth strategy, financial management, and executive leadership. The company's primary strengths lie in its clear runway for growth through new club expansion, a successful membership model with high retention rates, and a disciplined approach to investing in margin-enhancing initiatives like private brands and digital capabilities. The management team is stable, candid, and appears to be executing its strategy effectively. The only "No" is for labor relations, not due to negative evidence, but a lack of proactive, "outstanding" positive evidence required by Fisher's strict criterion. The score could be most influenced in the next 12-24 months by the pace and unit economics of its new club openings and its ability to maintain merchandise margin momentum in a competitive consumer environment. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on labor relations would require positive, verifiable data, such as industry awards for being a top employer or publicly disclosed data showing exceptionally low employee turnover relative to the retail sector.

fisher score is 14 / 15
