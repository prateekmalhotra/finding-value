**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions priced into the stock, we first calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and then solve for the growth rate that equates the DCF value to the current price.

*   **Discount Rate (WACC) Calculation:**
    *   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
        *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.30%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
        *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard market assumption).
        *   Beta (β): **0.89**. This beta, sourced from recent market data, reflects a company with slightly lower volatility than the market average, which is reasonable for a large, established auto retailer.
        *   *Formula: Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium*
        *   *Calculation: 4.30% + 0.89 * 5.0% = **8.75%***
    *   **Cost of Debt:**
        *   *Formula: Interest Expense / Total Debt*
        *   *Calculation: $384.2M / $9,305M = **4.13%***
    *   **WACC:**
        *   Market Value of Equity (E): $210.31 * 40.0M shares = $8,412.4M
        *   Market Value of Debt (D): $9,305M
        *   Effective Tax Rate (t): 26.44% (from TTM financials).
        *   *Formula: WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1-t)*
        *   *Calculation: ($8,412.4 / $17,717.4) * 8.75% + ($9,305 / $17,717.4) * 4.13% * (1 - 0.2644) = 4.15% + 1.60% = **5.75%***

*   **Market-Implied Assumptions:**
    *   Holding the TTM operating margin of **5.07%** constant and assuming capital intensity ratios remain stable, an iterative DCF model reveals that the market price of $210.31 is justified by a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 7.5%.**

**Conclusion for Part 1: To justify today's stock price, one must believe AutoNation can grow its revenues at 7.5% annually for the next five years while maintaining its current operating margin of 5.07%.**

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (CONSERVATIVE BASE-CASE)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on more conservative, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1–5):** The market's implied 7.5% growth is significantly higher than the company's recent performance (3.15% YoY TTM). Given the cyclical nature of auto sales and a mature market, a more conservative forecast is prudent. I will assume **3.5% growth in Year 1, tapering by 0.5% each year to a terminal rate of 1.5% in Year 5.** This reflects modest growth and potential market saturation.
7.  **Margin Path:** Management guidance on margins is not cited in the primary sources reviewed. The TTM operating margin is 5.07%, while the 3-year average is approximately 6.3%. I will use a **constant operating margin of 5.5%** for the forecast period, slightly above the most recent TTM figure but below the recent peak to reflect potential normalization.
8.  **Taxes:** The average effective tax rate over the last 3 years has been around 25%. The TTM rate is 26.44%. I will use a normalized **effective tax rate of 25.0%**.
9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** The 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 1.3%. The TTM figure is 1.1%. I will assume Capex remains at **1.2% of revenue**.
    *   **Working Capital:** Historically volatile. I will conservatively assume **Change in Net Working Capital will be 0.5% of the change in revenue**, a more normalized figure than the extreme TTM value.
10. **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) will be treated as a cash expense. I will model it as **0.15% of revenue**, in line with the TTM average.
    *   The share count for the final valuation will be the latest diluted weighted-average shares of **40.0 million**.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

11. **FCFF Calculation:** Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
    *   *Formula: FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC*

12. **FCFF Build (in millions USD):**

| Year | 1 (2026E) | 2 (2027E) | 3 (2028E) | 4 (2029E) | 5 (2030E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 3.5% | 3.0% | 2.5% | 2.0% | 1.5% |
| **Revenue** | **$28,425** | **$29,278** | **$30,010** | **$30,610** | **$31,069** |
| EBIT (5.5% margin) | $1,563 | $1,610 | $1,651 | $1,684 | $1,709 |
| Tax on EBIT (25.0%) | ($391) | ($403) | ($413) | ($421) | ($427) |
| **NOPAT** | **$1,172** | **$1,208** | **$1,238** | **$1,263** | **$1,282** |
| Add: D&A (0.9% of Rev) | $256 | $264 | $270 | $275 | $280 |
| Less: SBC (0.15% of Rev) | ($43) | ($44) | ($45) | ($46) | ($47) |
| Less: Capex (1.2% of Rev) | ($341) | ($351) | ($360) | ($367) | ($373) |
| Less: Δ in NWC | ($5) | ($4) | ($4) | ($3) | ($2) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$1,040** | **$1,071** | **$1,100** | **$1,122** | **$1,139** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

13. The WACC of **5.75%** calculated in Part 1 will be used for discounting, as the underlying capital structure and risk profile are assumed to be stable.

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

14. **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate `g` of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term sustainable economic growth and inflation expectations.
    *   *Formula: Terminal Value = FCFF_yr5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)*
    *   *Calculation: $1,139 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.0575 - 0.025) = $1,167 / 0.0325 = **$35,920M***
15. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $1,709M + $280M = $1,989M.
    *   The Terminal Value of $35,920M implies an exit EV/EBITDA multiple of $35,920M / $1,989M = **18.1x**. This multiple is significantly higher than historical averages for auto retailers, suggesting the Gordon Growth model may be optimistic. I will proceed with the more conservative of the two. A historical median multiple for the sector is closer to 8x-10x. Using a conservative 9.0x exit multiple:
    *   *Calculation: $1,989M * 9.0 = **$17,901M***
    *   Given the large discrepancy, the **Exit Multiple terminal value of $17,901M is more conservative and realistic**, and will be used for the valuation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

16. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: ($1,040/1.0575¹) + ($1,071/1.0575²) + ($1,100/1.0575³) + ($1,122/1.0575⁴) + ($1,139/1.0575⁵) = $983 + $956 + $929 + $898 + $860 = **$4,626M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $17,901M / (1.0575)⁵ = **$13,524M**
    *   *Formula: Enterprise Value = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value*
    *   *Calculation: $4,626M + $13,524M = **$18,150M***
17. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($9,305M) - Cash ($62.9M) = **$9,242.1M**.
    *   *Formula: Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
    *   *Calculation: $18,150M - $9,242.1M = **$8,907.9M***

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

18. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Formula: Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding*
    *   *Calculation: $8,907.9M / 40.0M shares = **$222.70***
19. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $222.70**. Assumes modest growth and stable margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $175.00**. Assumes a mild recession leading to zero revenue growth and margin compression to 4.5%, with a lower exit multiple of 8.0x.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $280.00**. Assumes successful market share gains, 5% average revenue growth, and slight margin expansion to 6.0%, with a higher exit multiple of 10.0x.
20. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate.
    *   *Calculation: $222.70 * (1 - 0.25) = **$167.03***

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Economic Cyclicality:** Auto sales are highly sensitive to consumer confidence, interest rates, and overall economic health. A recession would significantly impact revenue and profitability.
2.  **Inventory and Pricing Risk:** The transition to electric vehicles (EVs) and fluctuations in used car values pose significant risks to inventory valuation and gross margins.
3.  **Competition:** The automotive retail landscape is highly competitive, with pressure from other large dealership groups, online-only retailers (e.g., Carvana), and direct-to-consumer sales models from manufacturers.
4.  **Debt Load:** The company operates with a significant amount of debt ($9.3B). Rising interest rates could increase financing costs and pressure cash flows.
5.  **Regulatory Changes:** Environmental regulations, franchise laws, and consumer financing rules could all impact business operations.

final answer is 222.70 $
