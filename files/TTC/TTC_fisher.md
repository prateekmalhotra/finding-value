The Toro Company (TTC), August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Toro Company's products cater to a diverse range of end markets, including golf courses, sports fields, residential lawns, and construction.

The long-term trends of population growth, urbanization, and the importance of maintaining green spaces provide a solid foundation for future growth.

Synthesis:
The Toro Company scores well on the majority of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a fundamentally strong business with a long runway for growth, a commitment to innovation, and a solid financial position. The company's extensive distribution network and strong brand reputation provide significant competitive advantages. The primary area for potential improvement is in providing more public-facing evidence of outstanding labor relations. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the success of new product launches in the autonomous and alternative energy segments, and the company's ability to navigate macroeconomic headwinds and maintain its strong profit margins. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosures on employee satisfaction metrics, turnover rates, and union relations.

fisher score is 14 / 15
