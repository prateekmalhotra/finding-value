### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Key guidance from the Q1 FY2026 earnings call (August 8, 2025):
*   **Revenue:** "for the 2026... We expect revenue will decline 6% to seven percent year over year." (MarketBeat, August 8, 2025).
*   **Gross Margin:** The company anticipates "$100 million in additional tariff costs this year, pressuring gross margin by about 200 bps." (MarketBeat, August 8, 2025).
*   **Effective Tax Rate:** Management expects the "adjusted effective tax rate more than double fiscal 2025." (MarketScreener, August 8, 2025).

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Year 1 growth is set to -7.0%, the low end of guidance. Growth is then faded up towards a conservative 2.0% by Year 5. Rationale: Reflects management's negative outlook and competitive pressures.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 4.27% ($218.5M / $5,115M). Given the guided gross margin pressure and negative revenue growth, the operating margin is compressed to 3.5% and held flat. Rationale: No concrete drivers for margin expansion were cited by management.
*   **Taxes:** The FY2025 effective tax rate was approximately 1.4% (calculated as -$2.89M tax expense / -$204.16M pretax income). Doubling this is still very low. A more conservative approach is to use the U.S. statutory rate. We will assume a 25% effective tax rate. Rationale: This is a conservative long-term rate that accounts for profitability mix and statutory requirements.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled at 3.3% of revenue, slightly above the LTM rate of 3.1% ($158M / $5,115M). Rationale: A conservative assumption of continued investment.
    *   **D&A:** Forecast at 2.6% of revenue, in line with the LTM rate. Rationale: Assumes D&A tracks capital investment.
    *   **Working Capital:** Assumed to be a modest cash use of 0.5% of revenue annually. Rationale: LTM change was a significant cash use; a smaller outflow is assumed going forward but remains conservative.
*   **SBC and Dilution:** Stock-Based Compensation is subtracted from FCFF as a real cash cost. The diluted share count of 430 million is used.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula:** Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation.

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 6.50%. Rationale: High end of the typical range, reflecting market uncertainty.
*   **Beta (Î²):** 1.20. Rationale: A conservative beta reflecting industry cyclicality and company-specific execution risk, above the minimum 1.0 guideline.
*   **Cost of Equity (Ke):** 4.30% + 1.20 * 6.50% = **12.10%**
*   **Cost of Debt (Kd):** 1.0% (Calculated as TTM Interest Expense of $12.51M / Total Debt+Leases of $1,676M = 0.75%). A floor of 1.0% is used.
*   **WACC:** E/(E+D) * Ke + D/(E+D) * Kd * (1-T)
    *   Equity Value (Market Cap): $5.08/share * 430M shares = ~$2,184 M
    *   Debt + Leases Value: $1,676 M
    *   WACC = (2184 / 3860) * 12.10% + (1676 / 3860) * 1.0% * (1 - 0.25) = **7.17%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0%. Rationale: A conservative rate reflecting long-run inflation expectations and real GDP growth, and below the risk-free rate.
    *   **Terminal Value:** (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (20.5 * 1.02) / (7.17% - 2.0%) = **$404.9 M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $171.5M + $127.4M = $298.9M.
    *   A conservative 5.0x EV/EBITDA multiple implies a terminal value of $1,495M. The Gordon Growth method is more conservative and will be used.

| **Equity Value** | **($399.0)** | |

The calculation results in a negative Equity Value, which suggests that under these highly conservative assumptions, the company's operating assets do not generate enough cash flow to support its outstanding debt and lease obligations. This indicates significant financial distress or the need for a turnaround that is not yet reflected in guidance.

Given this result, a standard per-share value is not meaningful. The value is effectively zero, as the liabilities exceed the present value of future cash flows. However, for completeness, we can present this as a negative value.

### **H) Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Equity Value / Diluted Shares** = -$399.0M / 430M = **-$0.93 per share**.

A negative intrinsic value implies that the company's debt and lease obligations are greater than the value of its future cash flows based on this conservative forecast.

*   **Low Estimate:** $0.00 / share
*   **Base Estimate:** $0.00 / share
*   **High Estimate:** Not calculated. A positive valuation would require optimistic assumptions contrary to the stated objective.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Low):** $0.00 / share

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Revenue Decline:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the initial -7% revenue decline. If the company cannot stabilize sales after the guided downturn, cash flows will be insufficient to cover obligations.
2.  **Margin Pressure:** The forecast assumes margins stabilize at a compressed 3.5%. Further erosion due to competition, tariffs, or discounting would result in deeper operating losses and cash burn.
3.  **Debt & Leases:** The company has a significant debt and lease burden ($1.68B) relative to its calculated enterprise value ($366M). This leverage poses a substantial risk if the operational turnaround falters.
4.  **Turnaround Execution:** This valuation is based on current guidance and trends. It does not give credit for potential future turnarounds, new product successes, or market share gains that are not yet visible or guided by management. The value could be higher if a turnaround is successfully executed.
5.  **Brand Value:** The model does not explicitly value the "Under Armour" brand itself, which could have a liquidation or acquisition value not captured by this FCFF analysis. However, a brand's value is ultimately tied to its ability to generate future cash flows.

final answer is 0.00 $
