### **Revised Two-Stage Intrinsic Valuation: CareTrust REIT, Inc. (CTRE)**

**Company:** CareTrust REIT, Inc. (CTRE)
**Currency:** All figures in millions of U.S. Dollars (USD) unless otherwise stated.
**Date of Analysis:** August 23, 2025

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price. This part of the original analysis is logically sound and serves as an excellent benchmark.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$34.31** per share as of August 23, 2025.

2.  **Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months ending June 30, 2025):**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $373.42 |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $248.33 |
| *Operating Margin* | *66.50%* |
| Net Income | $219.92 |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $65.08 |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $9.54 |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | $9.76 |
| Change in Working Capital | $20.32 |
| Interest Expense | $33.11 |
| Cash & Equivalents | $306.05 |
| Total Debt | $1,155.38 |
| *Most Recent Shares Outstanding* | *200.3* |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

*   **Market Capitalization:** $34.31/share * 200.3M shares = $6,872.4M.
*   **Net Debt:** $1,155.38M (Total Debt) - $306.05M (Cash) = $849.33M.
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $6,872.4M + $849.33M = **$7,721.7M**.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
To justify the current market price of $34.31, an investor must believe the company can achieve a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 9.5%** while maintaining its trailing-twelve-month **operating margin of 66.5%**. This represents a belief in sustained high growth and peak profitability, setting a high bar for performance.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Corrected Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on more realistic, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** The operating assumptions from the original analysis are reasonable and form a solid conservative base. However, the discount rate and terminal value calculations contained flaws that require correction.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:**
    *   **Assumption:** Revenue will grow at 10% in Year 1, tapering by 2% annually to 2% in Year 5.
    *   **Justification:** This assumption is retained. It appropriately models a deceleration from recent acquisition-fueled growth to a more mature rate driven by rental escalators.

8.  **Margin Path:**
    *   **Assumption:** Operating margin will be stable at **64.5%**.
    *   **Justification:** This assumption is retained. Using the three-year historical average is a prudent and more sustainable forecast than using a peak TTM margin.

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Assumption:** **0% effective tax rate.**
    *   **Justification:** This is correct for a REIT.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** **15% of D&A.** As a triple-net lease REIT, this is a reasonable estimate for corporate-level capital needs not borne by tenants.
    *   **Working Capital:** **13% of incremental revenue.** This is a reasonable projection based on historical patterns.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** **2.5% of revenue**, treated as a cash cost.
    *   **Dilution:** Projected to **increase by 2.0% annually** to fund growth and account for SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **Formula:** Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) = EBIT * (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital.

13. **FCFF Forecast (USD Millions):** The underlying cash flow forecast remains unchanged from the original analysis, as the operating assumptions were sound.

| Year | 2026 (Y1) | 2027 (Y2) | 2028 (Y3) | 2029 (Y4) | 2030 (Y5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $410.76 | $443.62 | $470.24 | $489.05 | $498.83 |
| EBIT | $264.94 | $286.14 | $303.30 | $315.44 | $321.74 |
| **FCFF** | **$214.39** | **$231.54** | **$245.44** | **$255.25** | **$260.36** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC) - CORRECTED**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** The original calculation is reasonable and is retained.
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.26%** (10-year U.S. Treasury)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**
    *   **Beta (β):** **0.85**
    *   **Calculation:** 4.26% + 0.85 * 5.0% = **8.51%**.

15. **Cost of Debt - CORRECTED:**
    *   **Flaw Identified:** The original calculation (Interest Expense / Total Debt) derived a historical effective rate of 2.87%. This is unrealistic, as it is below the risk-free rate. The correct approach is to use the *current market borrowing rate* for the company.
    *   **Revised Assumption:** A more realistic pre-tax cost of debt is the Risk-Free Rate plus a credit spread. For a company like CTRE, a spread of 200 basis points (2.0%) is appropriate.
    *   **Calculation:** 4.26% (Risk-Free Rate) + 2.00% (Credit Spread) = **6.26%**. (After-tax cost is the same).

16. **WACC Calculation - CORRECTED:**
    *   **Weights:** Equity = 85.6%; Debt = 14.4% (Based on market values).
    *   **Calculation:** (0.856 * 8.51%) + (0.144 * 6.26%) = 7.29% + 0.90% = **8.19%**.

**F) TERMINAL VALUE - CORRECTED**

17. **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   **Flaw Identified:** The Gordon Growth method is highly sensitive to its inputs (WACC and g). The original 2.5% growth rate was arguably too conservative for a healthcare REIT benefiting from demographic tailwinds, leading to a low terminal value. An Exit Multiple approach based on peer valuations is more stable and market-oriented.
    *   **Assumption:** A terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of **14.0x**.
    *   **Justification:** This multiple is in line with the historical trading range of established healthcare REITs and reflects a stable, mature company with modest growth prospects. It is less conservative than the implied 13.1x multiple from the original analysis.
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA Projection:** EBIT_Y5 ($321.74M) + Projected D&A_Y5 ($86.95M) = **$408.69M**.
    *   **Terminal Value Calculation:** $408.69M * 14.0 = **$5,721.7M**.

18. **Cross-Check: Implied Gordon Growth Rate:**
    *   A terminal value of $5,721.7M implies a perpetual growth rate (g) of **3.48%**.
    *   **Formula:** g = (TV * WACC - FCFF_Y6) / (TV + FCFF_Y6)
    *   **Justification:** A 3.48% growth rate is more reflective of long-term healthcare spending growth and inflation than the prior 2.5% assumption. It is still a reasonable rate for a terminal period, confirming that the 14.0x exit multiple is a sound assumption.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE - REVISED**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($214.39/1.0819¹) + ... + ($260.36/1.0819⁵) = **$951.2M**
    *   **PV of Terminal Value:** $5,721.7M / (1.0819)⁵ = **$3,864.0M**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value:** $951.2M + $3,864.0M = **$4,815.2M**.

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   **Calculation:** $4,815.2M - $849.33M = **$3,965.9M**.

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY - REVISED**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Projected Year 5 Shares:** 200.3M * (1.02)⁵ = **221.1M shares**.
    *   **Formula:** Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Projected Diluted Shares
    *   **Calculation:** $3,965.9M / 221.1M = **$17.94**.

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$17.94**. (10% revenue growth tapering to 2%, 14.0x exit multiple).
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$14.75**. (Assumes slower 5% growth tapering to 2%, margin compression to 62%, and a 13.0x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$21.50**. (Assumes growth remains elevated at 12% tapering to 3%, margins expand to 66%, and a 15.0x exit multiple).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **Formula:** MOS Price = Base Case Fair Value * (1 - 30%)
    *   **Calculation:** $17.94 * 0.70 = **$12.56**.

### **Risk Notes**

The key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Tenant Risk:** A significant portion of revenue comes from a limited number of tenants; financial distress of a major tenant could impair rental income. 2) **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in healthcare reimbursement policies (e.g., from Medicare/Medicaid) could pressure the financial health of tenants, impacting their ability to pay rent. 3) **Interest Rate Risk:** As a REIT, the company is sensitive to interest rate changes, which can affect borrowing costs, property values, and stock price valuation multiples.

final answer is 17.94 $
