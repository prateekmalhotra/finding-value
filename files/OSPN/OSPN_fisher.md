OneSpan Inc. (OSPN), August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and various earnings call transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan operates in the growing digital agreements and secure authentication markets, driven by digital transformation, cloud adoption, and increasing cybersecurity threats like account takeover and push payment fraud. The company is focusing on high-margin software and subscription-based revenue, with Security Solutions and Digital Agreements subscription revenues growing 33% and 28% respectively in 2024. While hardware revenue is declining due to a market shift to "mobile-first" solutions, this is offset by growth in software-based authentication. The company targets banking, financial services, government, and healthcare sectors, which have long-term needs for these solutions.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan is actively developing new products and enhancing existing ones to meet evolving market demands. The company's R&D efforts are focused on building new features and functionality for its solutions, developing new product technologies, and enhancing its cloud platform. For example, the new Digipass FX family of authenticators is FIDO2-certified to enable passwordless authentication. R&D expenses were $32.4 million in 2024, demonstrating a continued commitment to innovation. The company has also made strategic acquisitions, such as ProvenDB, to incorporate new technologies like blockchain into its offerings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan’s R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was approximately 13.3% in 2024 ($32.4 million in R&D expense vs. $243.2 million in revenue). The company has a history of innovation with a portfolio of patents expiring between 2026 and 2040. OneSpan also supplements in-house R&D by licensing third-party software and making acquisitions like ProvenDB. However, the effectiveness of R&D can be questioned as the company has discontinued some products, like Digipass CX, and written off acquired technology, which indicates some R&D investments did not yield the expected returns.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan utilizes a multi-channel sales strategy with a direct sales force and a network of distributors, resellers, and system integrators. The company has a strong foothold in the financial sector, serving over 60 of the world's 100 largest banks. However, the 2024 10-K acknowledges that "limited awareness of our brand among buyers of e-signature tools" has been a challenge. Sales and marketing expenses were reduced significantly in 2024 as part of a restructuring plan, which may impact future sales growth. Net retention rate was 106% in 2024, down from 110% in 2023.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan's gross margin was 72% in 2024, an improvement from 67% in 2023. The company's operating margin has been inconsistent, with an operating loss in 2023 and an operating income in 2024. The company reported a net income of $57.1 million in 2024, compared to a net loss of $29.8 million in 2023. The company's strategic shift to focus on higher-margin software and subscription services is a positive indicator for future profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving profitability. In August 2023, the board approved restructuring actions to achieve higher profitability. These actions include a shift to high-margin software solutions, a reduction in headcount by approximately 330 positions and optimizing their real estate footprint. The company is also focused on growing its subscription revenue, which has a higher margin profile than its hardware business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan states it seeks to create a positive work environment, and its voluntary turnover rate in 2024 was 12.4%, which it believes compares favorably to the technology industry. The company offers competitive compensation and benefits and has a hybrid work model. However, the company has undergone significant restructuring, with total attrition at 24.3% in 2024 due to workforce reductions. The elimination of approximately 330 positions in recent years could negatively impact morale and employee relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been recent turnover in the executive team. Victor Limongelli was appointed CEO in July 2024, after serving as Interim CEO since January 2024. The previous CEO, Matthew Moynahan, departed in February 2024. The current executive team brings experience from various technology and software companies.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a named executive team beyond the CEO, including a CFO, CTO, and General Counsel, each with substantial experience in the technology and software industries. While the recent CEO change indicates some instability at the very top, the presence of experienced executives in key roles suggests a degree of management depth. However, detailed information on succession planning is not readily available in the provided documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan's financial statements are audited by KPMG LLP, a major accounting firm, and the auditor's report expresses an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides segment reporting for its Security Solutions and Digital Agreements businesses, offering some transparency into its cost structure. There is no mention of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the most recent 10-K.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan’s long-standing relationships with major financial institutions, including over 60 of the world's 100 largest banks, provide a significant competitive advantage in a sector with high barriers to entry. The company’s ability to offer both secure authentication and digital agreement solutions provides a comprehensive offering that can be attractive to customers looking to consolidate vendors. The shift to a subscription-based model, as measured by Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR), is a key indicator of the company's transition to a more predictable and scalable business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has undertaken significant restructuring to improve long-term profitability, even though this has resulted in short-term costs and disruptions. The company's strategic shift away from a pure growth focus in the Digital Agreements segment to a focus on "profitable, efficient growth" across both segments suggests a balanced approach to short- and long-term profitability. The emphasis on growing subscription revenue also supports a long-range view, as this provides a more predictable and sustainable revenue stream.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan had $83.2 million in cash and cash equivalents at the end of 2024 and generated $55.7 million in cash from operating activities in 2024. The company has no debt. The company initiated a stock repurchase program, authorizing up to $50 million in share repurchases, and a quarterly dividend in 2024, which suggests that management believes the company has sufficient capital.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan’s 2024 10-K openly discusses the challenges that led to the shift in strategy, such as the underperformance of the Digital Agreements segment against the previous strategic plan, increased competition, and lack of brand awareness. The company provides detailed financial reporting and holds regular earnings calls. This willingness to address challenges and changes in strategy suggests a good level of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OSPN/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OSPN/transcripts/)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a code of business conduct and ethics that applies to all employees and directors. The financial statements are audited by a reputable firm, and there are no reports of significant legal or regulatory issues related to management integrity in the provided documents. The company's 10-K also discloses its insider trading policy. Without any red flags in the provided documents, there is no reason to question management's integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
OneSpan scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly in its market opportunity, commitment to product development, financial stability, and transparency with investors. The company's strategic shift to focus on profitable growth and subscription-based revenue is a strong positive. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the effectiveness of its R&D investments in generating profitable new products and the ability of its restructured sales and marketing organization to drive growth and improve brand awareness. A sustained improvement in the net retention rate and evidence of successful new product adoption would be key indicators to watch. To flip the "No" answers to "Yes", the company would need to demonstrate more consistent R&D effectiveness through successful product launches and market adoption, stabilize its executive team, and show that its reduced sales and marketing organization can effectively compete and gain market share.
fisher score is 11 / 15
