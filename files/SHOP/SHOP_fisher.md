Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; Form 10-Q for quarters ended March 31, 2025, and June 30, 2025; Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's total addressable market (TAM) within retail is substantial, estimated at $4 trillion globally for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) alone. The company continues to expand its TAM by moving upmarket to service enterprise clients with "Shopify Commerce" and by expanding internationally. In Q2 2025, Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) grew 18% year-over-year to $65.3 billion, indicating continued strong demand for its core platform and merchant solutions. Management has also identified key growth vectors in offline retail through its Point-of-Sale (POS) solutions and B2B commerce.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's management consistently emphasizes innovation and platform expansion. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Tobi Lütke highlighted significant investments in new AI-powered tools for merchants ("Shopify Magic") and the continued buildout of enterprise capabilities. The company is also expanding its "Shopify Payments" and "Shopify Capital" offerings, demonstrating a focus on creating new revenue streams beyond core subscriptions. The recent expansion of their partner ecosystem further supports this commitment to future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's R&D expenses were approximately 25% of revenue for the fiscal year 2024, a significant investment aimed at maintaining a competitive edge. This investment has translated into tangible product enhancements, including a unified admin, AI-enabled features, and expanded POS hardware. While high, this level of investment is crucial for leadership in the fast-evolving commerce technology space. The company's "Editions" program, which biannually showcases over 100 new product updates, serves as a public testament to its R&D velocity and effectiveness.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's primary sales motion is product-led and self-serve for its core SMB segment, which is highly efficient and scalable. For its upmarket push into enterprise, the company has built a more traditional sales force focused on "Shopify Plus." The strong growth in Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) and Merchant Solutions revenue, up 18% and 20% respectively in Q2 2025, demonstrates the effectiveness of its overall sales and marketing efforts. The high attach rate of services like Shopify Payments is further evidence of a successful sales motion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000073/shop-20250630.htm'] (Q2 2025 10-Q, filed August 1, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify has demonstrated significant margin improvement. Gross margin for Q2 2025 was 52.1%. More importantly, after a period of heavy investment, the company has achieved positive operating income for several consecutive quarters, reaching $215 million in Q2 2025, or 10% of revenue. This signals a shift towards balancing growth with profitability, and its current margins are becoming competitive with other scaled software platforms.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000073/shop-20250630.htm'] (Q2 2025 10-Q, filed August 1, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has taken decisive action to improve margins, most notably by divesting its logistics businesses in 2023 to refocus on its higher-margin, asset-light software core. In 2024 and 2025, the company has emphasized "shaping the business for profitable growth," which includes disciplined headcount management and a focus on operating expense leverage. Continued growth in high-margin offerings like Shopify Payments and software subscriptions is also expected to be a key driver of future margin expansion.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify has undergone significant change, including major workforce reductions in 2023 and 2024 as part of its strategic realignment. While necessary for profitability, these actions have likely impacted employee morale. The company has since implemented a new compensation system and embraced a remote-first "Digital by Design" culture. However, the scale and recency of the layoffs prevent a clear "Yes" answer without more time to assess the long-term impact on culture and attrition. There are no mentions of unionization efforts in recent filings.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm'] (2024 10-K, filed February 13, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify is founder-led by CEO Tobi Lütke, whose vision continues to guide the company. The executive team, including President Harley Finkelstein and CFO Jeff Hoffmeister, appears stable and aligned. The 2024 10-K outlines a clear governance structure with an independent Lead Director. There have been no recent reports of significant executive infighting or high-profile, acrimonious departures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm'] (2024 10-K, filed February 13, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify has a strong bench of leaders under the top executives, with clear heads for key product areas like Core, Enterprise, and Merchant Services. The company's public presentations and "Editions" events often feature various product leaders, suggesting a distributed leadership model. However, the influence of founder-CEO Tobi Lütke is immense, creating a potential key-person risk that cannot be fully discounted.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm'] (2024 10-K, filed February 13, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's financial statements are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company has not reported any material weaknesses and has no history of major restatements. Financial disclosures provide reasonable granularity, breaking out revenue into "Subscription Solutions" and "Merchant Solutions."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm'] (2024 10-K, filed February 13, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's primary competitive advantage lies in its powerful ecosystem, which creates a strong network effect. This ecosystem consists of thousands of third-party app developers and theme designers who build solutions on the Shopify platform, creating high switching costs for merchants. This flywheel—where more merchants attract more developers, whose apps attract more merchants—is a key differentiator that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's focus on serving entrepreneurs and SMBs with easy-to-use tools has built a loyal user base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm'] (2024 10-K, filed February 13, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Historically, Shopify has prioritized long-term market capture and innovation over short-term profitability, exemplified by its heavy R&D spending and ventures into fulfillment. While the company has recently pivoted to focus on profitable growth, management's commentary continues to emphasize sustained, long-term value creation. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CFO Jeff Hoffmeister discussed balancing operating discipline with continued investment in key strategic areas, indicating a blended but still long-range approach.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SHOP/transcripts/'] (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 31, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's financial position is very strong. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $4.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The business is now generating positive free cash flow, reporting $155 million for the second quarter of 2025. This combination of a robust balance sheet and positive cash flow generation makes it highly unlikely that the company will need to raise equity for its operational needs in the foreseeable future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000073/shop-20250630.htm'] (Q2 2025 10-Q, filed August 1, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a high degree of candor. When Shopify sold its logistics business and conducted layoffs, CEO Tobi Lütke published detailed public letters explaining the strategic rationale behind the difficult decisions. The company's quarterly earnings calls and shareholder letters provide transparent discussions of both successes and challenges, and the management team consistently answers tough questions from analysts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SHOP/transcripts/'] (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 31, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant legal, regulatory, or ethical issues concerning Shopify's senior management. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K discloses various routine matters but no litigation that would question the integrity of the executive team. Governance structures, including an independent board and standard audit and risk committees, are in place. There are no notable related-party transactions or other red flags in their recent filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm'] (2024 10-K, filed February 13, 2025)

Synthesis:
Shopify scores highly on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strong market potential, a commitment to innovation, and a robust financial position. The company's key strengths lie in its powerful ecosystem network effect and its recent, decisive pivot toward profitable growth, which is now evident in its financial results. The primary negative, or area of caution, stems from the recent significant workforce reductions, the long-term impact of which on company culture and talent retention is not yet fully clear. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are continued execution on margin improvement and the success of its push into the enterprise market. A sustained period of positive employee sentiment and demonstrated success in landing larger enterprise clients would be the key evidence needed to flip the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes."

fisher score is 14 / 15
