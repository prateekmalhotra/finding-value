### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the current stock price to understand the growth and profitability assumptions embedded within it.

**A) Current Market Price & Baseline Financials**

*   **Current Market Price:** $40.14 (as of market close, August 21, 2025).

*   **Baseline Financials (LTM as of May 4, 2025):**
| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $12,100 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Gross Margin | 29.2% | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $124.9 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Net Income | $388.2 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $116.6 | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $315.5 | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |
| Capital Expenditures | $152.2 | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |
| Change in Working Capital | ($4.0) | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |
| Interest Expense | $5.5 | Form 10-K, Feb. 2, 2025 (p. 61) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $616.4 | StockAnalysis Balance Sheet |
| Total Debt | $535.3 | StockAnalysis Balance Sheet |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 428.0 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |

**B) Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current enterprise value of approximately **$16.5 billion** (Market Cap of $16.57B less Net Cash of $81.1M), the market must underwrite significant growth and margin expansion. The company's Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF), when treating stock-based compensation as a real cash cost, is negative.

*   **FCFF Formula:** EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC
*   **TTM FCFF Calculation:** $124.9M * (1 - 0.25) + $116.6M - $315.5M - $152.2M - (-$4.0M) = **-$253.4M**

Given this negative baseline FCFF, the current valuation is entirely dependent on future performance. A quantitative reverse DCF is highly sensitive to the assumed margin trajectory. However, a plausible scenario that approximates the current market price would require Chewy to achieve a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 9-11%** while simultaneously expanding its **operating (EBIT) margin from ~1% today to a terminal margin of 7-8%**.

This implies the market believes Chewy will successfully leverage its scale, expand its higher-margin healthcare and private label businesses, and control costs effectively to transform its profitability profile.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds a 5-year DCF model based on independent, conservative assumptions grounded in historical performance and management commentary.

**C) Forecast & Conservative Assumptions**

My assumptions deviate from the market-implied view by projecting more moderate growth and margin expansion, reflecting potential economic headwinds and competitive pressures.

*   **Revenue (Years 1-5):** I am projecting a revenue CAGR of 6.0% over the next five years, starting at 8% in Year 1 and tapering to 4% by Year 5. This is below the 3-year historical CAGR of 9.7% and reflects the law of large numbers and management's own citation of a 4% projected industry CAGR through 2028 (Form 10-K, Feb. 2, 2025, p. 3).
*   **Operating Margin:** I project the operating (EBIT) margin to expand from a baseline of 1.5% in Year 1 to 4.0% by Year 5. This expansion is predicated on operating leverage and growth in higher-margin offerings like pet health but remains conservatively below the 7-8% implied by the market.
*   **Tax Rate:** A normalized effective tax rate of **25.0%** is used throughout the forecast period, assuming sustained profitability.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled at **1.5% of annual revenue**, which is below the 3-year historical average of ~1.9%, assuming increased efficiency as the fulfillment network matures.
    *   **D&A:** Modeled at **1.0% of annual revenue**, reflecting a slight increase from TTM ~0.96% as the asset base grows.
    *   **Change in NWC:** Modeled as **-0.5% of the change in revenue**, reflecting continued efficiency in managing inventory and trade payables (i.e., working capital is a source of cash as revenue grows).
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Treated as a real cash cost and modeled at a consistent **2.0% of annual revenue**, a slight moderation from the current ~2.6%.
    *   **Share Count:** The share count has decreased by approximately 4% in the past year due to active repurchase programs (Form 10-K, Feb. 2, 2025, p. 35). Accounting for offsetting dilution from SBC, I project a net **1.0% annual reduction in diluted shares outstanding**.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
*   **Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $13,068 | $13,983 | $14,822 | $15,563 | $16,185 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *8.0%* | *7.0%* | *6.0%* | *5.0%* | *4.0%* |
| EBIT | $196.0 | $244.7 | $296.4 | $389.1 | $485.6 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *1.5%* | *1.75%* | *2.0%* | *2.5%* | *3.0%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 0.75) | $147.0 | $183.5 | $222.3 | $291.8 | $364.2 |
| (+) D&A (@1.0% Rev) | $130.7 | $139.8 | $148.2 | $155.6 | $161.9 |
| (-) Capex (@1.5% Rev) | ($196.0) | ($209.7) | ($222.3) | ($233.4) | ($242.8) |
| (-) SBC (@2.0% Rev) | ($261.4) | ($279.7) | ($296.4) | ($311.3) | ($323.7) |
| (-) Change in NWC | ($4.8) | ($4.6) | ($4.2) | ($3.7) | ($3.1) |
| **FCFF** | **($174.9)** | **($161.5)** | **($144.0)** | **($93.6)** | **($37.3)** |

*Note: The model projects negative FCFF during the explicit forecast period due to conservative margin assumptions and the treatment of SBC as a cash expense.*

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM) Formula:** Risk-Free Rate + (Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.34%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of August 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.5%** (Standard assumption for a mature market).
    *   Levered Beta: **1.67** (Source: StockAnalysis.com). This reflects higher-than-market volatility, consistent with a high-growth, consumer discretionary stock.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.34% + (1.67 * 5.5%) = **13.53%***
*   **Cost of Debt:** **6.0%** (Estimated pre-tax cost of debt for the company).
*   **WACC Formula:** (E/V * Cost of Equity) + (D/V * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate))
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): $16.57 Billion
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $0.54 Billion
    *   Total Value (V): $16.57B + $0.54B = $17.11 Billion
    *   *WACC = (16.57/17.11 * 13.53%) + (0.54/17.11 * 6.0% * (1 - 0.25)) = **13.25%***

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term sustainable economic growth.
    *   To be consistent, we project Year 6 financials: Revenue Y6 = $16,185M * (1+0.025) = $16,589M. Assuming terminal EBIT margin of 4.0% and continued capital intensity, D&A, SBC, and NWC efficiency, FCFF in Year 6 would be approximately $85.0M.
    *   *Terminal Value (Gordon Growth) = ($85.0M * (1 + 0.025)) / (13.25% - 2.5%) = **$810 Million***
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBIT = $485.6M; Year 5 D&A = $161.9M; Year 5 EBITDA = $647.5M
    *   The Gordon Growth Terminal Value of $810M implies an EV/EBITDA exit multiple of **1.3x** ($810M / $647.5M). This is extremely low and unrealistic for a market leader.
    *   Given the discrepancy and the user's guidance for realism, the Exit Multiple approach is more appropriate. A **10.0x EV/EBITDA** multiple is a realistic assumption for a stable market-leading e-commerce company.
    *   *Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $647.5M (Year 5 EBITDA) * 10.0 = **$6,475 Million***
    *   **Selected Terminal Value:** $6,475 Million.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value Formula:** PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) = (-$174.9 / 1.1325^1) + (-$161.5 / 1.1325^2) + (-$144.0 / 1.1325^3) + (-$93.6 / 1.1325^4) + (-$37.3 / 1.1325^5) = **-$455.36 Million**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $6,475M / (1.1325^5) = **$3,478.41 Million**
    *   *Enterprise Value = -$455.36M + $3,478.41M = **$3,023.05 Million***
*   **Equity Value Formula:** Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($535.3M) - Cash ($616.4M) = **-$81.1 Million (Net Cash)** (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet).
    *   *Equity Value = $3,023.05M - (-$81.1M) = **$3,104.15 Million***

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Year 5 Diluted Shares:** 428.0M (Baseline) * (1 - 0.01)^5 = **406.98 Million shares**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value = $3,104.15M / 406.98M shares = $7.63**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $7.63**. Based on the conservative assumptions outlined above.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$4.00**. Assumes revenue growth flattens to 2-3% and margins compress due to competitive pressure, leading to a lower 7x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$15.00**. Assumes revenue growth averages 10% and operating margins successfully expand to 5.5% by Year 5, justifying a 12x exit multiple.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** $7.63 * (1 - 0.30) = **$5.34**

**Risk Notes**

The base-case valuation is subject to several key risks: 1) **Intense Competition:** Chewy faces immense pressure from Amazon, specialty retailers, and mass merchants, which could limit pricing power and margin expansion. 2) **Consumer Spending:** As a seller of many discretionary items, a slowdown in consumer spending could negatively impact revenue growth and sales of higher-margin products. 3) **Input Cost Volatility:** Fluctuations in shipping, labor, and product costs could challenge the company's ability to achieve its profitability targets. 4) **Execution Risk:** The valuation is dependent on the successful expansion into new verticals like veterinary care and pet insurance, which carry significant execution risks and may not achieve expected returns.

final answer is 7.63 $
