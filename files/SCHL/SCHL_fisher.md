### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic is pursuing significant growth by leveraging its extensive intellectual property (IP) library across different media formats. The recent acquisition of 9 Story Media Group, a major independent children's content creator, is central to this strategy, expanding Scholastic's capabilities in development, production, and licensing for video-on-demand platforms. While the core book publishing and distribution channels face some market softness, the company is actively working to grow its footprint, targeting 90,000 book fairs in fiscal 2025. The combination of monetizing a deep well of existing IP through entertainment and maintaining a large-scale, unique distribution network in schools provides a multi-year runway for potential sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to evolving the business beyond its traditional publishing roots. The most significant evidence is the acquisition of 9 Story on June 20, 2024, for approximately $193.7 million, funded by new debt. This was a major strategic capital allocation decision aimed squarely at creating new revenue streams in the entertainment sector. Additionally, even in challenged segments like Education Solutions, the company is actively developing new supplemental products aligned with market shifts, expected to launch for the 2025/2026 school year. These actions show a clear determination to invest in future growth engines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's R&D is primarily reflected in its "prepublication expenditures," which represent investments in creating new books and educational materials. For the nine months ended February 28, 2025, these expenditures were $15.8 million against revenues of $1.12 billion, or approximately 1.4%. The effectiveness of this content development is proven by the enduring success of major franchises like *Dog Man* and *The Hunger Games*, which continue to be major sales drivers. However, not all investments have been successful; the company recognized a $3.1 million asset impairment in fiscal 2024 on an education technology business acquired in fiscal 2023, indicating some development efforts have not yielded expected returns. Without clear metrics or peer comparisons, the evidence of effectiveness is mixed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's primary sales organization is its unique, school-based distribution network for its Book Fairs and Book Clubs, which represents a significant competitive advantage and a direct channel to its core customers. The effectiveness of this organization is demonstrated by recent performance; revenues from School Reading Events increased in the third fiscal quarter of 2025, driven by a higher count of book fairs and increased revenue per sponsor in book clubs. The scale of this network is substantial, with the company expecting to hold 90,000 fairs in fiscal 2025. This proprietary channel is difficult for competitors to replicate and has proven resilient in reaching young readers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's profitability is inconsistent and weighed down by certain segments. The core Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment is profitable, posting an operating margin of 10.8% for the nine months ended February 28, 2025. However, the consolidated business reported an operating loss of $37.7 million for that same period, as results were negatively impacted by losses in the Education Solutions and Entertainment segments, as well as significant unallocated corporate overhead. The business is also highly seasonal, and while profitable in its key second fiscal quarter, its operating margin declined to 13.7% in Q2 FY2025 from 18.0% in Q2 FY2024. The lack of consistent, company-wide profitability indicates margins are not currently worthwhile on a consolidated basis.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively implementing measures to improve profitability. The company's fiscal 2025 third-quarter operating loss improved by 32% year-over-year, which the company directly attributes to a "reduction in discretionary overhead expenses." Furthermore, filings from both the second and third fiscal quarters of 2025 mention incurring severance expenses related to broad "cost-saving initiatives," indicating a focus on streamlining the organization and reducing its expense base. The company has also benefited from favorable product mix and lower print costs in its book fairs channel, contributing to improved cost of goods sold.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific disclosure regarding labor and personnel relations in the recent SEC filings. The filings do mention severance costs associated with restructuring, but this does not provide a full picture of employee morale or relations. Without positive, verifiable evidence from filings, news sources, or employee reviews regarding high morale, low turnover, or other positive indicators, it is not possible to confirm that relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent filings do not indicate any significant issues such as high executive turnover or public disputes among the leadership team. The senior executive team, including the CEO and CFO, have been consistent in their roles through the recent strategic acquisition and restructuring efforts. However, without specific disclosures on succession planning or the internal dynamics of the executive team, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that relations are "outstanding" beyond a normal professional level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership structure appears functional with a President and CEO, Peter Warwick, and an Executive Vice President and CFO, Haji L. Glover, signing off on financial reports. Scholastic is organized into four distinct reportable segments—Children’s Book Publishing and Distribution, Education Solutions, Entertainment, and International—which implies there are leaders managing each of these significant business units. However, the public filings do not provide detailed information about the executives below the named officers or discuss succession planning, making it difficult to fully assess the depth of the management bench.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's SEC filings are consistently filed on time and provide detailed segment-level financial data, allowing for analysis of revenues and operating income by business unit. The CEO and CFO have certified the effectiveness of the company's disclosure controls and procedures as of February 28, 2025, stating they are effective. The report also notes there were no material changes to internal control over financial reporting during the quarter. The company has no recent history of financial restatements. This evidence points to solid and reliable accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's key competitive advantage is its unparalleled distribution network through school-based Book Fairs and Book Clubs. This channel provides direct, curated access to children, parents, and teachers, a moat that is very difficult for traditional retailers or other publishers to replicate at scale. The company's brand is synonymous with reading in schools for millions of families. A second crucial aspect is its vast library of owned, high-value IP, including globally recognized franchises like *Harry Potter* (publishing rights), *The Hunger Games*, and *Clifford The Big Red Dog*. This IP provides a durable competitive edge and significant potential for monetization in other media, as evidenced by the 9 Story acquisition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672924000034/schl-20241130.htm) (December 20, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's recent actions strongly suggest a long-range outlook. The company took on $275 million in debt to fund the $193.7 million acquisition of 9 Story, a move that increased near-term interest expense and contributed to a net loss but is positioned as a long-term strategic play on IP monetization. In the Q3 FY2025 MD&A, the company states it is making progress on "Company-wide synergies which are expected to benefit the Entertainment segment in fiscal 2026 and beyond." This language clearly prioritizes future durable growth over immediate profitability. The continued investment in developing new education products despite current segment headwinds also supports this long-term view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position appears solid, and management prioritizes returning capital to shareholders over issuing equity. As of February 28, 2025, the company had access to its $400 million credit facility, with $124.6 million of availability remaining. Instead of issuing shares, Scholastic has a history of aggressive share repurchases. During the nine months ended February 28, 2025, the company repurchased $40.0 million of its common stock. On March 19, 2025, the Board authorized an increase in the buy-back program, bringing the total authorization to $100 million. This consistent repurchasing demonstrates a strong balance sheet and a commitment to preventing, rather than causing, dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion in SEC filings openly addresses business challenges. For example, the MD&A for the quarter ended February 28, 2025, directly discusses "increasing pressure on consumer spending," "general softness in the retail book market," and the negative impact on the Education Solutions segment from a "decline in spending on supplemental materials." It also plainly states that in the Entertainment segment, "delays in production greenlights from major platforms are expected to impact production work in the near-term." This willingness to transparently discuss headwinds and segment-specific issues in official filings suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SCHL/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SCHL/transcripts/) (2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags in recent SEC filings that would question the integrity of management. The company's independent auditors have not identified any material weaknesses in internal controls. Filings are timely, and there are no disclosures of significant legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or regulatory actions that would imply a lack of integrity. The CEO and CFO personally certify the financial statements each quarter. The absence of such negative indicators supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866729/000086672925000012/schl-20250228.htm) (March 21, 2025)

---
Synthesis:
Scholastic scores positively on its strategic direction, financial stability, and governance. The company's strongest attributes are its unparalleled school-based sales channels, its vast and valuable IP library, and a clear, long-range strategy to monetize that IP through the recent 9 Story acquisition. Management has demonstrated a commitment to this strategy while also taking steps to control costs. The balance sheet is strong, underscored by a consistent and significant share buyback program. The primary weaknesses are current profitability, with the consolidated company posting losses due to underperformance in the Education and Entertainment segments, and a lack of evidence for outstanding internal relations (both executive and general labor). The score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on the performance of the new Entertainment segment. Specific evidence that would flip a "No" to a "Yes" would be the Entertainment and Education Solutions segments achieving sustained operating profitability, which would in turn make the company's overall profit margins "worthwhile."

fisher score is 9 / 15
