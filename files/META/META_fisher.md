Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024; Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's core advertising business operates within the global digital ad market, which is forecast to grow from approximately $650 billion in 2025 to over $1.4 trillion by 2034. This provides a substantial runway for growth, particularly in less-monetized regions. Furthermore, the company is making massive long-term investments in nascent, high-growth potential markets, including AI and the metaverse. The metaverse market alone is projected to approach $1 trillion by 2030. Meta’s daily active people (DAP) across its apps grew 7% year-over-year to 3.27 billion in June 2024, demonstrating the continued reach of its existing platforms.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's commitment is demonstrated by its substantial and growing investments in future technologies. Research and development expenses were $10.5 billion for the second quarter of 2024 alone. The company has guided for capital expenditures of $37 billion to $40 billion in 2024, explicitly stating an expectation for this to "grow significantly in 2025 as we invest to support our AI research and product development efforts." These investments are targeted at long-term initiatives like the metaverse and building out a significant AI infrastructure, indicating a clear focus on developing next-generation revenue streams.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's R&D intensity is among the highest in the technology sector. For the second quarter of 2024, R&D spending was 27% of revenue. A 2023 analysis showed Meta's R&D as a percentage of revenue (29.7%) was the highest among the "Magnificent 7," surpassing Alphabet (14.7%) and Apple (7.8%). The output of this spending is tangible, with AI investments leading to improved ad performance and the development of large language models like Llama. These efforts directly support the core business while also building foundational technology for future platforms.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's "sales organization" is predominantly its highly effective and scalable self-service advertising platform, which powers the vast majority of its revenue. The platform's success is evidenced by a 22% year-over-year increase in advertising revenue to $38.3 billion in Q2 2024. This growth was driven by a 10% increase in ad impressions and a 10% increase in average price per ad, indicating strong demand from a diverse global base of marketers. This self-service model is exceptionally efficient, allowing Meta to serve millions of advertisers with minimal direct sales overhead, a clear hallmark of an above-average system.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta demonstrates exceptionally strong profitability. In the second quarter of 2024, the company achieved an operating margin of 38%. This is a significant figure for a company of its scale and represents a substantial improvement from 29% in the same period of the prior year. The core Family of Apps segment is even more profitable, boasting a 50% operating margin in the same quarter, which subsidizes the heavy investment in the unprofitable Reality Labs segment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has taken explicit and effective steps to improve margins. The company's "year of efficiency" initiative, which began in 2022, included significant layoffs and a consolidation of office facilities, with restructuring charges detailed in its financial reports. This operational discipline is reflected in the year-over-year expansion of the operating margin to 38% from 29%. Concurrently, Meta is leveraging AI to enhance the efficiency and performance of its advertising systems, which management believes is driving improved results for advertisers and supports pricing power.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Fisher's standard of "outstanding" is difficult to meet, particularly after a period of significant change. In 2022 and 2023, Meta conducted large-scale layoffs, impacting over 21,000 employees. More recent reports from early 2025 describe a work environment "full of anxiety," with managers required to categorize a certain percentage of their teams as underperformers to facilitate performance-based cuts. While these actions were part of a strategic "year of efficiency" that investors rewarded, they have reportedly battered employee morale.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable, with long-tenured leaders in key roles. Mark Zuckerberg's position as founder, Chairman, CEO, and controlling shareholder ensures strategic consistency and shields the company from activist investors. The C-suite includes experienced leaders such as Javier Olivan (COO), Susan Li (CFO), Andrew Bosworth (CTO), and Chris Cox (CPO), indicating a solid leadership structure around the founder. There have been no recent reports of significant executive infighting or instability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta has a deep bench of experienced executives managing its core functions and reporting to the CEO. Key leaders beyond Mr. Zuckerberg include Javier Olivan (Chief Operating Officer), who oversees global business operations; Susan Li (Chief Financial Officer), managing fiscal strategy; Andrew Bosworth (Chief Technology Officer), leading AR/VR innovation; and Chris Cox (Chief Product Officer), overseeing the Family of Apps. This structure demonstrates a clear division of responsibilities among seasoned professionals who manage the day-to-day operations and long-term technology roadmaps of the company's vast segments.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta’s financial reporting provides clear segmentation between its Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) divisions, offering investors transparent insight into the profitability of the core business and the scale of investment in future initiatives. In its latest 10-Q, management stated that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a "reasonable assurance level." The company's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and there is no recent history of material weaknesses or financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The paramount competitive advantage in social media is the network effect. Meta's global daily active people (DAP) of 3.27 billion creates an immense moat; users stay because their friends and family are on the platforms, and advertisers come to reach this massive audience. This scale also generates a data advantage, allowing Meta's AI-driven content recommendation and ad-targeting engines to be more effective than smaller rivals. Furthermore, the company's massive, self-built global infrastructure of data centers represents a significant capital barrier to entry for potential competitors.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's financial structure is a clear demonstration of its long-range outlook. The highly profitable Family of Apps segment (50% operating margin) is used to fund massive, long-term, and currently unprofitable investments in Reality Labs. The RL segment posted a $4.5 billion operating loss in Q2 2024 alone, and the company explicitly stated it expects these losses to "increase meaningfully in 2024." Management has described the metaverse as a "long-term initiative... that may only be fully realized in the next decade," a clear willingness to sacrifice short-term profits for a long-term vision.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta has an exceptionally strong financial position that obviates any need for dilutive equity financing. As of June 30, 2024, the company held $58.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. It generated $38.6 billion in cash from operations in the first six months of 2024. Instead of issuing shares, Meta is actively returning capital to shareholders, having repurchased $21.0 billion of its stock in the first half of 2024 and initiating a dividend program.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a track record of discussing challenges directly. During the difficult period in late 2022 and early 2023, CEO Mark Zuckerberg openly discussed the need for organizational change and efficiency improvements. In the Q1 2023 earnings call, he explicitly outlined the goals of the "efficiency work" to improve financial performance and product development speed. The company has also been forthcoming about the financial impact of Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) changes and the substantial, multi-billion dollar quarterly losses in its Reality Labs segment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Fisher’s bar of "unquestionable integrity" is extremely high. Meta faces a significant number of legal and regulatory challenges that call its practices into question. The Legal Proceedings section of its 10-Q is extensive, detailing major antitrust litigation from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and a €1.2 billion fine from the Irish Data Protection Commission for unlawful data transfers. It also discloses a recent action by the FTC seeking to modify its 2020 consent order due to alleged compliance failures and a $1.4 billion settlement with the State of Texas regarding the use of biometric data. This pattern of regulatory scrutiny and significant penalties related to core business practices makes it impossible to conclude that management's integrity is "unquestionable."
**Answer:** No

---
Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
Meta Platforms scores strongly on most of Fisher's points, demonstrating a dominant and highly profitable core business with a clear commitment to long-term growth. The company's key strengths lie in its massive user base and network effects, exceptional profit margins, and a willingness to invest heavily in future technologies like AI and the metaverse at the expense of short-term earnings. The primary weaknesses identified relate to personnel and integrity. Recent large-scale layoffs have reportedly damaged employee morale, and a consistent pattern of major regulatory fines and antitrust lawsuits prevents the company from meeting Fisher’s high bar for “unquestionable integrity.” The score could improve in the next 12–24 months if the Reality Labs division shows a clear path to reduced losses or if the company can navigate its regulatory challenges without further significant penalties. Conversely, a failure to rebuild employee trust or another major regulatory action, particularly a negative outcome in the FTC's antitrust case, would reinforce the current score.

fisher score is 13 / 15
