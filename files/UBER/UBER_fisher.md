**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber operates in the vast and growing shared mobility and delivery markets. The global shared mobility market was valued at $346.61 billion in 2025 and is projected to reach $780.28 billion by 2030, a 17.62% compound annual growth rate. Uber is capturing this growth, with Q2 2025 results showing a 17% YoY increase in Gross Bookings to $46.8 billion and a 15% YoY increase in Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs) to 180 million. The expansion into adjacent verticals like grocery, retail, and advertising provides additional vectors for sustained growth.

Strategic initiatives announced in 2025 include an expanded partnership with Waymo and new agreements with Lucid and Nuro for autonomous vehicle integration, positioning the company for the next generation of mobility. Furthermore, the acquisition of an 85% stake in Trendyol GO expands the company's delivery footprint in Turkey, demonstrating a continued focus on geographic and product expansion.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's R&D spending significantly outpaces its direct competitors, indicating a commitment to innovation at scale. For the twelve months ending June 30, 2025, Uber's R&D expense was $3.214 billion, compared to Lyft's $420.1 million for the same period. This investment supports the complex marketplace, dispatching, and routing algorithms that are core to the platform's efficiency and user experience. The output is visible through consistent feature rollouts, the growing advertising platform, and the integration of third-party AV technology.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For Uber's platform business, the "sales organization" is its ability to attract and retain users on both sides of its marketplaces. Evidence suggests this is highly effective; Monthly Active Platform Consumers grew 15% YoY to 180 million in Q2 2025. On the supply side, the number of drivers and couriers has also shown strong growth, increasing from 6.8 million in Q4 2023 to 7.8 million in Q2 2024, indicating a strong ability to attract participants to its network. The growth of the Uber for Business and advertising platforms further demonstrates effective sales and partnership capabilities.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber has demonstrated significant operating leverage and achieved strong margins relative to peers. In Q2 2025, the company reported income from operations of $1.5 billion on $12.7 billion of revenue, for an operating margin of approximately 11.8%. Its Adjusted EBITDA margin as a percentage of Gross Bookings was 4.5%, an improvement from 3.9% in Q2 2024. This compares favorably to competitors like Lyft, which reported an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 2.9% in the same quarter.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on driving profitable growth through operational efficiency, cost discipline, and platform synergies. In Q2 2025, operating income grew 82% on 18% revenue growth, showcasing strong operating leverage. The company is scaling its high-margin advertising business and promoting cross-platform usage through its Uber One membership program, as multi-service users are more than three times as profitable as single-platform users. Continued investment in automation and platform improvements, including AI, are designed to further improve efficiency and pricing optimization.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's relationship with its drivers remains a significant challenge. While the company states that driver satisfaction is a priority, driver surveys indicate persistent dissatisfaction with earnings. The legal and regulatory battles over driver classification as independent contractors continue in multiple jurisdictions, creating an adversarial relationship. Internally, the company has mandated a return-to-office policy which may affect employee morale, though this mirrors a broader industry trend. Given the ongoing friction with a core component of its workforce (drivers), relations cannot be considered "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team under CEO Dara Khosrowshahi has seen a period of relative stability since he took over. However, in June 2025, the company announced the departure of its head of Delivery, Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, a nearly 13-year veteran, alongside the reinstatement of a Chief Operating Officer role filled by promotion from within. While framed as a strategic evolution, the departure of a long-tenured, key segment leader in conjunction with a significant leadership restructuring introduces uncertainty and prevents a clear "Yes" for outstanding and stable relations at the highest level.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated management depth by promoting from within to fill a key leadership role. Andrew Macdonald, who joined Uber in 2012, was promoted to the new COO role in June 2025, taking responsibility for the global Mobility, Delivery, and autonomous-driving businesses. Uber's 2024 10-K and proxy statements detail a full slate of executive officers beyond the CEO, including a CFO, Chief Legal Officer, and Chief People Officer, indicating a professionalized and deep management team is in place to run the global, complex business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.morningstar.com/news/dow-jones/202506024195/uber-promotes-new-operations-chief-as-delivery-head-steps-down (June 2, 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315125000008/uber-20241231.htm (February 14, 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's public filings indicate strong accounting controls. The company's 2024 10-K includes a statement from management affirming the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was audited by their independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which issued an unqualified opinion. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking out revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for Mobility, Delivery, and Freight, which demonstrates a granular level of cost analysis and control.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's primary competitive advantage stems from its powerful two-sided network effects and its "super app" strategy. As more drivers and riders join the platform, the service becomes faster and more reliable, creating a virtuous cycle that is difficult for smaller competitors to replicate. By integrating both Mobility and Delivery into a single application and membership program (Uber One), Uber increases user stickiness and lifetime value. This cross-platform synergy provides a durable competitive advantage over mono-service competitors.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is pursuing a balanced approach. The company is investing in long-range, speculative projects like autonomous vehicle partnerships, indicating a long-term view on the evolution of mobility. However, it is also highly focused on near-term profitability and shareholder returns, as evidenced by its guidance for 30-40% compounded annual Adjusted EBITDA growth over the next three years and the initiation of a massive $20 billion share buyback program. This blend of investing for the future while delivering strong current profits demonstrates a sophisticated capital allocation strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's financial position is exceptionally strong, mitigating dilution risk. The company generated $8.5 billion in free cash flow on a trailing twelve-month basis as of Q2 2025 and holds a strong cash and short-term investments balance. More importantly, the company's board has authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program, signaling that it is actively reducing its share count rather than issuing new equity to fund growth. This robust cash generation and commitment to buybacks provides a powerful defense against shareholder dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Current management has demonstrated a high degree of candor. The company's SEC filings contain an exhaustive "Risk Factors" section detailing numerous challenges, from driver classification to competition and regulation. On earnings calls, executives openly discuss headwinds, such as the cyclical downturn in the Freight segment. A key piece of evidence for transparency is the company's proactive release of safety reports, which include sensitive and potentially damaging data on incidents occurring on the platform. This willingness to openly discuss challenges fosters investor trust.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Uber's culture has improved significantly under its current leadership compared to its controversial past, the company still faces regulatory challenges that question its practices. In April 2025, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against Uber, alleging deceptive billing and cancellation practices related to its Uber One subscription service. An active FTC lawsuit alleging deceptive practices against consumers prevents the company's management from being described as having "unquestionable integrity," which is the highest possible bar.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis**

Uber scores well on Fisher's framework, demonstrating strong market potential, a commitment to innovation, worthwhile and improving profit margins, and a robust financial position that allows for significant shareholder returns. Its key strengths lie in the powerful network effects of its platform and a balanced approach to long-term growth and near-term profitability. The primary weaknesses and risks are concentrated in its relationships with external parties—specifically the ongoing tensions with drivers over compensation and classification, and persistent regulatory scrutiny, highlighted by the recent FTC lawsuit. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12–24 months are the outcomes of major legal and regulatory battles regarding driver classification and the resolution of the FTC's lawsuit. A definitive settlement of driver status that preserves the independent contractor model would flip Point 7 to "Yes." Similarly, a favorable resolution of the FTC case without an admission of wrongdoing and with minor changes to its subscription practices could change the answer for Point 15.

fisher score is 12 / 15
