### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The semiconductor industry is intensely competitive. AMD faces significant competition from Intel in CPUs and Nvidia in GPUs, which could impact market share and pricing power.
2.  **Geopolitical Risks:** A significant portion of AMD's revenue is derived from international sales, particularly in China. Regulatory changes or trade tensions could adversely affect sales and supply chains.
3.  **Cyclical Industry:** The semiconductor industry is subject to cyclical demand, which can lead to periods of oversupply and price erosion, impacting revenue and profitability.
4.  **Technological Execution:** AMD's success is contingent on its ability to innovate and execute on its product roadmap. Delays or missteps in product development could allow competitors to gain a technological advantage.
