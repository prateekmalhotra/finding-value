FitLife Brands, Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FitLife Brands competes in the growing nutritional supplement industry, which is driven by an aging population, increasing health awareness, and a trend toward preventative medicine. The company has a diversified portfolio of brands, including NDS Nutrition, PMD Sports, Dr. Tobias, and MusclePharm, catering to various market segments from sports nutrition to general wellness. The company's multi-channel distribution strategy, which includes GNC, Amazon, and other wholesale partners, provides broad market access. The recent acquisitions of Mimi's Rock Corp. (MRC) and MusclePharm have significantly expanded FitLife's product offerings and market reach.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a demonstrated commitment to new product development and reformulation. In the year ended December 31, 2024, FitLife Brands introduced 23 new products, including 19 completely new products and 4 product reformulations and flavor extensions. This follows the introduction of 18 new products in 2023. This continuous innovation is crucial for staying competitive in the dynamic nutritional supplement market. The recent launch of the MusclePharm Pro Series in Vitamin Shoppe stores is another example of the company's focus on new product initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company's financial statements do not provide a specific line item for research and development, its track record of new product launches and reformulations indicates a focus on innovation. The company introduced 23 new products in 2024 and 18 in 2023. Given the company's size, this level of product development suggests an effective, if not formally quantified, R&D process. However, without specific R&D spending figures, it is difficult to definitively assess the efficiency of these efforts.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FitLife Brands utilizes a multi-channel sales approach that includes wholesale, retail, and direct-to-consumer online sales. The company has a long-standing relationship with GNC, a major player in the nutritional supplement retail space. Furthermore, the company has successfully expanded its online presence, with approximately 67% of its revenue in 2024 coming from e-commerce platforms like Amazon. The recent acquisitions of MRC and MusclePharm have further diversified the company's sales channels. This multi-pronged approach to sales and distribution appears to be effective in reaching a broad customer base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, FitLife Brands reported a gross margin of 43.6%, an increase from 40.7% in the prior year. The company's net income for the same period was $8.984 million, a 70% increase from the previous year. These figures indicate a healthy and improving profit margin, especially for a company in a competitive industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively working to improve profit margins. The 2024 10-K notes that the increase in gross margin was "primarily attributable to higher margins from MRC and Legacy FitLife as well as the amortization of the fair value step-up to MRC inventory acquired in the first quarter of 2023." This suggests a focus on profitable product lines and the successful integration of acquisitions. The company has also been optimizing its advertising spend to improve efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states, "We consider our employee relations to be good." As of December 31, 2024, the company had 39 full-time employees. There are no reports of labor disputes or other significant personnel issues in the company's SEC filings. However, the available information is limited and qualitative.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's Chairman and CEO, Dayton Judd, has a significant ownership stake in the company, which aligns his interests with those of shareholders. The company's SEC filings do not indicate any issues with executive turnover or other signs of discord within the management team. The board of directors includes a mix of inside and independent directors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's SEC filings identify a small executive team, including the CEO and CFO. While the company has been successful, its reliance on a few key executives could be a risk. The company's 10-K acknowledges this, stating, "We are dependent on Dayton Judd, our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, for the continued performance of our business."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a statement from management that "our internal control over financial reporting was effective" as of December 31, 2024. The company's financial statements are audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. There are no reported issues with the company's accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the nutritional supplement industry, brand recognition and distribution are key. FitLife's acquisition of established brands like MusclePharm and Dr. Tobias, combined with its strong presence on Amazon, gives it a competitive edge. The company's ability to successfully integrate these acquisitions and leverage their existing distribution channels is a positive indicator. The company's relationship with GNC, despite some past disputes, remains a valuable asset.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent acquisitions of MRC and MusclePharm, funded in part by debt, indicate a willingness to invest in long-term growth. While these acquisitions have added complexity and integration challenges, they have also significantly expanded the company's revenue base and market presence. Management's focus on building out these new brands suggests a long-range perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, the company had a positive working capital of $8.5 million and has been generating positive cash flow from operations. The company has been paying down its debt and has a share repurchase program in place, which is anti-dilutive. The company's recent acquisitions were funded through debt and cash on hand, not equity. This suggests that the company is not likely to resort to dilutive equity financing in the near future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925016990/ftlf20250331_10q.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Risk Factors" section of the company's 10-K is comprehensive and details the various challenges and risks the company faces. The company's quarterly reports provide detailed breakdowns of revenue by brand and channel, offering a good level of transparency. The company also disclosed a commercial dispute with GNC in its filings, which suggests a willingness to be open about challenges.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K reports no material legal proceedings. There are no other indications of any integrity issues with the company's management in the available SEC filings. The company has a code of ethics and an insider trading policy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1374328/000143774925009469/ftlf20241231_10k.htm']

Synthesis:
FitLife Brands, Inc. scores well on many of Fisher's 15 points, particularly those related to its product-market fit, growth strategy, and financial health. The company has a diversified portfolio of brands in a growing industry, a strong multi-channel sales organization, and healthy profit margins. Management appears to be focused on long-term growth, as evidenced by its recent acquisitions and ongoing product development. The company's strong balance sheet and cash flow also mitigate the risk of dilutive financing. The primary areas of concern are the company's reliance on a small management team and the lack of specific data on R&D spending. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months by demonstrating successful integration of its recent acquisitions, continued profitable growth, and further diversification of its management team. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" on R&D effectiveness if the company were to provide more detailed information on its innovation pipeline and the financial returns from new products. Similarly, a "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" on management depth with the addition of new key executives.

fisher score is 12 / 15
