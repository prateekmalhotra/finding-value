**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker operates in the resilient life sciences tools and diagnostics markets, which are supported by long-term tailwinds like aging populations, increased healthcare spending, and the need for new therapeutics.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker consistently reinvests a significant portion of its revenue into R&D, a core part of its stated "Project Accelerate 2.0" strategy. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, the company invested $156.4 million in R&D, an increase from the prior year, to drive innovation in key areas. Management's commentary during the Q2 2025 earnings call emphasized its focus on launching "differentiated, high-value solutions" and using strategic M&A, like the recent acquisition of Chemsense, to enter adjacent high-growth markets.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue is consistently around 9-10%, a figure that is competitive with peers in the life sciences tools industry. For the full year 2024, R&D expense was $287.3 million on $2.96 billion in revenue (9.7%). The output of this spending is evident in its market leadership in niche categories like mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance, and the successful launches of next-generation platforms that command strong orders, demonstrating effective conversion of R&D into commercially successful products.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a strong ability to grow its revenues and bookings, indicating an effective sales organization. In its Q2 2025 results, Bruker reported 8.5% organic revenue growth year-over-year, with a book-to-bill ratio above one, signaling healthy demand and sales execution.

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker maintains solid profit margins for its industry. For the full fiscal year 2024, the company reported a non-GAAP operating margin of 19.5%. For the second quarter of 2025, the company's non-GAAP operating margin was 18.7%, demonstrating resilience despite inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. These margins are competitive within the life science tools sector and indicate a strong, defensible market position for its products.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin expansion through several initiatives under its "Project Accelerate 2.0" framework. These include operational excellence programs to drive manufacturing efficiencies and supply chain savings.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker's 2024 10-K discloses a global workforce of approximately 9,700 employees and notes that its success depends on attracting and retaining qualified personnel. It mentions a focus on creating an inclusive and safe work environment. However, beyond these standard disclosures, there is limited specific, verifiable evidence in its filings or recent transcripts to definitively conclude that its labor relations are "outstanding" compared to peers. Without specific metrics on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations, a definitive "Yes" cannot be supported.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There appears to be stability in the core executive team. Frank H. Laukien has served as Chairman, President, and CEO for many years, indicating consistent leadership. The executive team listed in the 2024 10-K shows reasonable tenure in key positions. There have been no recent reports of significant executive infighting or turmoil. This stability suggests a functional and aligned senior leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker's organizational structure includes presidents for each of its major operating groups (BioSpin, CALID, NANO), who are named executive officers with significant industry experience. This divisional leadership structure suggests a layer of experienced management below the CEO level, mitigating key-person risk. The company has also successfully integrated numerous acquisitions, which requires a deep bench of operational and strategic talent to oversee.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker’s 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers GmbH, on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down revenues and profits for its BSI and BEST segments. There is no history of significant financial restatements or material weaknesses cited in recent filings, indicating that controls are robust and effective.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the life sciences tools industry, a key competitive advantage is the large installed base of instruments, which creates a recurring revenue stream from consumables, software, and services (the "razor/blade" model). Bruker's 2024 10-K notes that recurring revenues from its aftermarket offerings were approximately 30% of total revenue in 2024. This high-margin, stable revenue stream provides a significant competitive advantage and sticky customer relationships, which is a hallmark of a top-tier company in this sector.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's consistent emphasis on its "Project Accelerate 2.0" strategy and its high R&D reinvestment rate (9-10% of revenue) strongly indicates a focus on long-term growth over short-term profit maximization. In earnings calls, the leadership team consistently discusses investing in innovation and market expansion to drive sustainable, high-single-digit growth for the long term, even if it means near-term margin pressure from those investments. This demonstrates a willingness to prioritize durable growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bruker maintains a strong balance sheet and generates healthy cash flow. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $558.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. For the first six months of 2025, it generated $125.7 million in cash from operating activities. The company has a manageable debt load and has historically used debt and cash on hand to fund its acquisitions. This financial strength and cash-generating capability make significant dilutive equity financing unlikely for the foreseeable future.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's Q2 2025 earnings call transcript shows that management openly addresses challenges alongside successes. For example, they discussed specific supply chain pressures affecting certain product lines and the negative impacts of foreign exchange rates, providing detailed explanations and context. This willingness to discuss headwinds as well as tailwinds in public investor forums demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings disclose its code of conduct and governance policies aimed at ensuring integrity. The most recent 10-K does not list any material ongoing legal proceedings related to executive misconduct or corruption. There are no recent, significant regulatory actions or scandals reported in reputable news sources. While integrity is difficult to prove definitively, the absence of major red flags in public filings and reports supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

***
**Synthesis:**
Bruker Corporation scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong market position, commitment to R&D-driven innovation, and sound financial management. The company's strengths lie in its long-term growth prospects in the life sciences market, effective R&D that translates into successful products, and a stable, long-tenured management team. The primary negative, or rather an unknown, is the lack of detailed public information on employee relations, a common issue for companies that don't proactively disclose metrics like turnover. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the continued successful commercialization of its newest instrument platforms, which is critical for maintaining growth momentum, and its ability to successfully integrate acquisitions while improving operating margins. A "No" on labor relations could flip to "Yes" with enhanced "Human Capital" disclosures in future 10-K filings that provide concrete metrics on employee satisfaction and retention.

fisher score is 14 / 15
