**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's addressable market in Human Capital Management (HCM) is large and expanding, driven by trends like the gig economy, increasingly complex regulations, and a shift to outsourcing. The company is focused on expanding its international presence and growing its Professional Employer Organization (PEO) services, which saw a 7% increase in revenues year-over-year as of the latest fiscal year. Management noted continued demand for their newer, cloud-based platforms like WorkForce Now and Vantage HCM, with ongoing opportunities to cross-sell additional services such as retirement and insurance services to their vast client base of over 1 million clients.

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP demonstrates a strong commitment to innovation through consistent product launches and enhancements, particularly in high-growth areas like artificial intelligence and data analytics (ADP DataCloud). In its most recent annual report, the company highlighted its "next-gen" platforms and mobile-first solutions as key to its strategy. Management confirmed on their May 7, 2025 earnings call that they are focused on "infusing generative AI into our products to drive efficiency and enhance the client experience," indicating a clear strategy to evolve their offerings beyond traditional payroll processing.

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's R&D investment is substantial and has yielded successful next-generation platforms. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, ADP invested approximately $1.3 billion in systems development and programming, consistent with prior years. While ADP doesn't disclose R&D as a percentage of revenue, this level of spending supports a steady stream of new products and AI-driven enhancements like the "AI-powered Payroll" feature. The successful rollout and adoption of platforms like WorkForce Now, which serves the key mid-market, demonstrates effective R&D output.

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent growth in new business bookings points to a highly effective sales organization. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, PEO new business bookings grew 8%, a metric management called "solid." Employer Services new business bookings also showed continued momentum. This performance is supported by a large direct sales force, channel partnerships, and a strong brand reputation that facilitates sales conversations. The company's client retention rate remains high, consistently exceeding 90%, further evidence of the sales and service organization's strength.

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP consistently operates with strong profit margins that compare favorably to its industry.

The PEO services segment boasts high margins, and the Employer Services segment maintains strong profitability. This level of margin is indicative of the company's scale, technological leverage, and pricing power.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's senior management team exhibits stability and long tenure. The CEO, Maria Black, has been with the company since 1996 and has held numerous leadership roles before her appointment, indicating a strong internal succession plan. Other members of the executive committee also possess deep industry and company experience.

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a deep bench of experienced leaders across its various business segments and geographic regions. The executive team listed in the annual report includes not just C-suite officers but also presidents of major divisions like National Account Services, Small Business Services, and International. This structure, combined with a track record of promoting from within (as seen with the current CEO), suggests a well-developed pipeline of management talent.
**Answer:** Yes

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, mature public company, ADP has robust accounting controls. The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025. There is no history of major restatements or material weaknesses. The company provides detailed segment reporting, offering clear insight into the costs and profitability of its Employer Services and PEO Services divisions.
**Answer:** Yes

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the payroll and PEO industry is the use of "client fund assets," which are funds held by ADP between funding by clients and remittance to employees and tax authorities. ADP earns significant interest income on these funds, which totaled $985 million for fiscal 2025. This "float" income is a massive, low-cost source of profit unique to the industry's structure and is very difficult for smaller competitors to replicate at ADP's scale. This provides a durable competitive moat.
**Answer:** Yes

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's management consistently emphasizes sustainable, long-term growth over short-term quarterly gains. They provide a full-year outlook and discuss multi-year strategic initiatives, such as the ongoing investment in next-generation platforms and AI. While the company is disciplined about meeting its guidance, the commentary on earnings calls focuses on foundational drivers like client retention, new business bookings, and product innovation, which support long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, eliminating any foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing. ADP generated $3.9 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2025. It has a consistent and substantial share repurchase program, having bought back $2.6 billion of its stock in the same period, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, not diluting them. The business is self-funding with high cash generation.
**Answer:** Yes

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's management maintains a regular and transparent communication cadence with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor conferences, and detailed financial filings. During the Q&A portion of its earnings calls, management addresses challenging questions directly, providing detailed explanations for areas of underperformance or macroeconomic headwinds. For instance, on the May 7, 2025 call, they openly discussed the specific factors affecting PEO bookings and the pays-per-control metric, demonstrating a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal or regulatory actions cited in the company's SEC filings that would question the integrity of its senior management. The 2025 10-K lists routine litigation and regulatory matters but states that management does not expect them to have a material adverse effect. The company has a long-standing reputation as a stable and ethical operator, with strong corporate governance practices outlined in its proxy statement.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
ADP scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its status as a mature, high-quality industry leader with durable competitive advantages. The strongest positives are its massive scale, significant free cash flow, high client retention, and a unique, structural advantage from its client funds investment strategy. The management team is stable, experienced, and shareholder-friendly, with a clear focus on both long-term innovation and consistent operational execution. The key variables that could influence this score in the next 12–24 months would be a significant cybersecurity breach, which could damage its reputation for data security, or a prolonged and severe recession that materially impacts client employment levels and business formation rates, thereby slowing new bookings growth. A change in interest rate policy could also materially impact the significant income earned on client funds.

fisher score is 15 / 15
