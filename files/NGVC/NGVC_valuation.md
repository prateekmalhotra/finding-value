### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| EBIT | $64.55 | $68.49 | $72.13 | $75.46 | $78.85 |
| Tax | ($13.44) | ($14.26) | ($15.02) | ($15.71) | ($16.42) |
| NOPAT | $51.11 | $54.23 | $57.11 | $59.75 | $62.43 |
| D&A | $33.42 | $33.42 | $33.42 | $33.42 | $33.42 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (10-Year Treasury Yield as of August 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium)
    *   **Beta:** 1.25 (5-year monthly beta)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 1.25 * 5.0% = 10.55%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Interest Expense / Average Debt:** 3.42 / 334.53 = 1.02%
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 1.02% * (1 - 20.82%) = 0.81%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** $890.85 million
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $334.53 million
    *   **WACC = (890.85 / (890.85 + 334.53)) * 10.55% + (334.53 / (890.85 + 334.53)) * 0.81% = 7.99%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Reflecting long-term inflation expectations)
    *   **Terminal Value = (59.63 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0799 - 0.025) = $1,113.14 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $112.27 million (EBIT + D&A)
    *   **Median EV/EBITDA Multiple:** Not explicitly sourced, but a conservative 8x multiple is assumed based on the grocery industry.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 112.27 * 8 = $898.16 million**
    *   **Conclusion:** The lower of the two terminal values, the Exit Multiple method, will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $52.04/(1.0799)^1 + $54.26/(1.0799)^2 + $56.23/(1.0799)^3 + $57.93/(1.0799)^4 + $59.63/(1.0799)^5 = $220.08 million
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $898.16 / (1.0799)^5 = $611.75 million
    *   **Enterprise Value = $220.08 + $611.75 = $831.83 million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = $831.83 (Enterprise Value) - $334.53 (Total Debt) + $13.18 (Cash) = $510.48 million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **$510.48 million (Equity Value) / 23.00 million (Shares) = $22.19 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $22.19
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Using a lower revenue growth rate (5% in year 1, declining to 2.5%) and a higher WACC (9%) results in a value of **$16.50**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Using a higher revenue growth rate (9% in year 1, declining to 6%) and a lower WACC (7.5%) results in a value of **$28.50**.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **MOS Price (30% below Base Case) = $22.19 * (1 - 0.30) = $15.53**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The grocery industry is highly competitive, with pressure from larger conventional and specialty retailers.
2.  **Consumer Spending:** A downturn in the economy could lead to reduced consumer spending on premium and organic products.
3.  **Supply Chain Disruptions:** As seen with the UNFI cybersecurity incident, disruptions in the supply chain can negatively impact sales and profitability.
4.  **Inflation:** Rising food and labor costs could pressure margins if not fully passed on to consumers.
5.  **Store Growth Execution:** The company's growth is dependent on its ability to successfully open and operate new stores.

final answer is 22.19 $
