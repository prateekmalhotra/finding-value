I've found the relevant SEC filings. The most important one is the 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, filed on March 27, 2025. I will also look for the latest 6-K which would contain the most recent quarterly results (Q1 and Q2 2025). I see a 6-K filed on August 11, 2025, which should contain the latest financial information. I will also need to browse `stockanalysis.com` for some data.

I will now browse the URLs from my search to find the financial data. I'll start with the investor relations page, then the 20-F, and then the most recent 6-K to get the TTM data. Then I will look at the other provided links.
I have gathered the financial data from StockAnalysis, which appears to be sourced from S&P Global Market Intelligence and updated as of May 22, 2025. This should be sufficient for the TTM baseline financials. I was unable to access the SEC filing directly through the `browse` tool. I'll proceed with the data I have and cite the source accordingly.

Next, I'll search for management guidance from earnings call transcripts. I'll use the provided link.
I have accessed the earnings call transcripts page. The latest one is for Q1 2025, dated May 23. I'll browse that to look for guidance.
I am having trouble accessing the specific earnings call transcript. I will try a search to find the Q1 2025 earnings call transcript for CAAP.I found the transcript for the Q1 2025 earnings call held on May 23, 2025. I can't seem to find explicit numerical guidance for full-year 2025 revenue growth or margins. Management commentary is positive, highlighting "strong momentum", "solid rebound" in Argentina, and "steady growth" in other key markets. However, without specific numbers, I will need to rely on historical data and management's qualitative commentary to build my forecast.

Now I have enough information to start building the valuation. I will use the TTM data from StockAnalysis as my baseline, and then build the forecast based on historical trends and the positive-but-non-specific management commentary.

Here is the plan:
1.  **A) Baseline Financials:** Compile the TTM data into a table.
2.  **B) Management Guidance:** Note the qualitative commentary.
3.  **C) Forecast Assumptions:**
    *   **Revenue:** I'll calculate the 3-year revenue CAGR from 2022-2024 and use that as a starting point, tempered by the recent positive commentary.
    *   **Margins:** I'll use a 3-year average operating margin.
    *   **Taxes:** I'll use the 3-year average effective tax rate.
    *   **Capex, Working Capital, SBC:** I'll use 3-year averages as a percentage of revenue or as a constant.
4.  **D) FCFF Construction:** Project FCFF for 5 years.
5.  **E) WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** I will search for the current 10-year US Treasury yield.
    *   **Beta:** I'll search for "CAAP stock beta".
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** I'll use 5.0%.
6.  **F) Terminal Value:** Gordon Growth model and Exit Multiple cross-check.
7.  **G) Equity Bridge:** Calculate Enterprise and Equity Value.
8.  **H) Per-Share Value:** Calculate Base, Bear, and Bull cases and the Margin of Safety price.

I'll start by finding the risk-free rate and beta.The 10-year Treasury yield is approximately 4.30%. I'll use that as my risk-free rate. StockAnalysis reports a 5-year beta of 1.37 for CAAP. This beta is greater than 1, suggesting that the stock is more volatile than the overall market. Given the company's concentration in emerging markets (primarily Latin America), this higher volatility and risk profile seem reasonable.

I now have all the necessary inputs to perform the valuation. I will construct the final response following the user's detailed formatting instructions.

### B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION

No explicit quantitative guidance for FY2025 was provided in the latest earnings call. Management commentary was qualitatively positive:
*   "The strong momentum continued into April with consolidated traffic growing 14% year-over-year..." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 23, 2025).
*   "The quarter delivered a strong performance led by Argentina's solid rebound and steady growth across Italy, Uruguay, and Brazil..." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 23, 2025).
*   "Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged. We remain focused on pursuing both organic and inorganic growth opportunities to expand our airport portfolio and deliver value creation to our shareholders." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 23, 2025).

### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | 11.0% | With no explicit guidance, this rate is based on the 3-year historical revenue CAGR (2022-2024), which is approximately 15%, tempered slightly to account for the law of large numbers and potential macroeconomic headwinds. Management's positive commentary on strong traffic growth supports a double-digit assumption. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com revenue data for FY2022, 2023, 2024). |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 24.7% | Based on the 3-year average operating margin (2022-2024), which was 21.1%, 29.7%, and 23.4% respectively. Kept stable as there is no specific management guidance on margin expansion initiatives. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data). |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 35.0% | The reported TTM tax rate is 56% and the FY2024 rate was 49%, both appearing abnormally high. The average of FY2022 and FY2024 is used for a more normalized rate, acknowledging volatility in the company's tax jurisdictions. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data). |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | 11.5% | In line with the 3-year historical average (2022-2024) to reflect the ongoing depreciation of assets. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data). |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 0.1% | Reflects the historical average and is treated as a cash expense. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data). |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 5.0% | Based on the 3-year average of capex as a percentage of revenue, adjusted for historical volatility. This is a conservative assumption given the TTM capex is low. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data). |
| **Change in WC as % of Δ Rev** | 10.0% | Based on the historical relationship between working capital changes and revenue growth, assuming a portion of growth requires investment in working capital. |

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for valuation because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure changes.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Y1 (2026E) | Y2 (2027E) | Y3 (2028E) | Y4 (2029E) | Y5 (2030E) |

| Revenue | $2,062.4 | $2,289.3 | $2,541.1 | $2,820.6 | $3,130.9 |
| EBIT | $509.4 | $565.4 | $627.6 | $696.7 | $773.3 |
| EBIT \* (1-Tax Rate) | $331.1 | $367.5 | $408.0 | $452.8 | $502.7 |
| \+ D&A | $237.2 | $263.3 | $292.2 | $324.4 | $360.0 |
| \- SBC | $2.1 | $2.3 | $2.5 | $2.8 | $3.1 |

| \- Δ in Working Capital | $20.4 | $22.7 | $25.2 | $27.9 | $31.0 |
| **FCFF** | **$442.7** | **$491.3** | **$545.4** | **$605.5** | **$672.1** |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.30% | Current 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield. (YCharts, August 20, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard premium for a developed market, applied conservatively. |
| Beta (5-Year) | 1.37 | Reflects higher volatility than the market, consistent with exposure to emerging markets. (StockAnalysis.com). |
| **Cost of Equity (Calculated)** | **11.15%** | Formula: Risk-Free Rate + Beta \* Equity Risk Premium |
| | | |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Interest Expense / Avg. Debt | 8.8% | Pre-tax cost of debt calculated from TTM interest expense and average total debt. (StockAnalysis.com). |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | **5.72%** | Formula: Pre-Tax Cost of Debt \* (1 - Tax Rate) |
| | | |
| **WACC Calculation** | | |
| Equity Market Cap | $3,371.3M | (161.8M shares \* $20.81 share price as of Aug 20, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt | $1,149.0M | (StockAnalysis.com, as of Mar 31, 2025) |
| Weight of Equity | 74.6% | |
| Weight of Debt | 25.4% | |
| **WACC (Calculated)** | **9.78%** | Formula: (Weight of Equity \* Cost of Equity) + (Weight of Debt \* Cost of Debt) |

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

1.  **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. A reasonable long-term growth assumption, in line with long-run inflation expectations and global GDP growth.
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Calculation:** ($672.1 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0978 - 0.025) = **$9,466.8M**

2.  **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $1,133.3M (EBIT of $773.3M + D&A of $360.0M)
    *   **Historical Median EV/EBITDA:** A 5-year median multiple for the airport sector is typically in the 8-12x range. A conservative 9.0x multiple is used.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple):** 9.0 \* $1,133.3M = **$10,199.7M**

The Gordon Growth method results in a more conservative terminal value and will be used for the base case.

| \+ Cash & Equivalents | $448.6 | (StockAnalysis.com, as of Mar 31, 2025) |
| **Equity Value** | **$7,213.7** | **Enterprise Value - Net Debt** |

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $44.59** (Equity Value $7,213.7M / 161.8M Diluted Shares)

| Case | Assumptions | Fair Value / Share |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

### ONE-PARAGRAPH RISK NOTES

Key risks to this valuation include macroeconomic instability in Argentina, a key market, which could negatively impact passenger traffic and revenue. Regulatory and political risks are significant, as the company operates under concessions that can be subject to changes in government policy, fees, and capital expenditure requirements. Furthermore, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly the Argentine Peso, can create significant volatility in reported earnings and cash flows. A global economic downturn or a resurgence of travel restrictions could also severely impact the entire airport industry, affecting all of CAAP's operating regions. Finally, the company's ability to manage its debt and secure financing for necessary capital projects is crucial for maintaining and expanding its operations.
