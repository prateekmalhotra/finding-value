**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's key competitive advantages are its vast and efficient logistics network, the network effects of its e-commerce marketplace, and the Prime membership program, which creates a loyal customer base.

Synthesis:
Amazon scores well on most of Fisher's points, with its strongest positives being its long-term growth prospects in cloud computing and e-commerce, its commitment to innovation, and its strong financial position. The company's management depth and long-range outlook are also key strengths. The primary negatives are its ongoing labor relations issues and the significant antitrust scrutiny it faces from regulators. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the resolution of these regulatory challenges and any significant changes in its labor relations. A "No" on integrity could flip to a "Yes" if the company can successfully navigate its antitrust challenges without significant penalties or changes to its business model.

fisher score is 13 / 15
