Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, filed February 4, 2025; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025, filed April 29, 2025; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, filed July 29, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal operates in the vast and growing digital payments market. In 2024, the company processed $1.68 trillion in Total Payment Volume (TPV), a 10% increase from 2023, and ended the year with 434 million active accounts. Strategic initiatives like "PayPal Everywhere" aim to expand PayPal's presence in physical retail, a significant total addressable market (TAM) expansion. The launch of a physical Mastercard for PayPal Credit in June 2025 further bridges the gap between digital and physical commerce. Analyst estimates project continued revenue growth to $34.57 billion in 2026 and $37.06 billion in 2027, indicating a long runway for sales growth.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal is actively developing and launching new products. In early 2025, the company launched its "PayPal Everywhere" campaign to move into physical retail. It also introduced a physical credit card for its PayPal Credit service in June 2025. The company is also enhancing Venmo by integrating the debit card into the core experience and exploring new monetization strategies. These initiatives demonstrate a commitment to developing new products and expanding into new markets to drive future growth.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's Technology and Development expenses were $2.98 billion in 2024, representing 9.4% of net revenues. In the first six months of 2025, these expenses were $1.5 billion, or 9.3% of revenue. This level of investment has led to the launch of new products like the physical PayPal Credit card and ongoing enhancements to Venmo and Braintree. The company is also developing a "dynamic smart wallet." While these are positive developments, the 7% decrease in transactions in Q1 2025 raises questions about the immediate return on R&D investment in driving user activity.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal serves nearly 90% of Fortune 500 companies and over 36 million merchants globally. The company is enhancing its offerings for small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) through PayPal Complete Payments (PPCP), which simplifies services with an integrated solution. Sales and marketing expenses increased by 11% in 2024 and 24% in the first six months of 2025, indicating a strong focus on customer acquisition and marketing. However, the 7% drop in transactions in Q1 2025 suggests challenges in translating marketing efforts into increased user activity.

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, PayPal's operating margin was 17%, and its net profit margin was 13%. For the first six months of 2025, the operating margin improved to 19%, and the net profit margin was 15.9%. These margins demonstrate strong profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has initiated a global workforce reduction to streamline operations and improve the company's cost structure. In Q1 2025, PayPal saw an 8% increase in transaction margin dollars, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of profitable growth. The company is also shifting its Braintree strategy to focus on more profitable, strategic partnerships rather than just processing volume.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, PayPal employed approximately 24,400 people globally. The company reports a focus on employee well-being, diversity, and inclusion. However, the company initiated a global workforce reduction in the first quarter of 2024 and another in the first quarter of 2025 to streamline operations. While these actions are aimed at improving efficiency, they can negatively impact employee morale and relations.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has experienced some recent turnover in its executive ranks, including a new CEO, Alex Chriss, who started in late 2023. While management changes are not unusual, a period of stability would be beneficial. The current executive team is a mix of long-tenured and newer leaders.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the company's management has concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment information and a breakdown of its operating expenses in its SEC filings, suggesting a good handle on cost analysis. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or significant accounting issues.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's two-sided network, connecting 434 million active accounts, creates a strong network effect that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's brand is highly trusted by consumers and merchants, a key differentiator in the payments industry. PayPal also holds numerous regulatory licenses to operate in approximately 200 markets, which creates a significant barrier to entry.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's recent actions indicate a shift towards prioritizing profitable growth. The company is focusing on improving the profitability of Braintree by seeking strategic partnerships rather than just volume. It is also investing in long-term initiatives like PayPal Everywhere and the development of a "dynamic smart wallet," which may take time to fully monetize but are aimed at long-term, durable growth.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has a strong financial position with $7.45 billion in net cash provided by operating activities in 2024. The company has a significant stock repurchase program, with $16.9 billion available for future repurchases as of June 30, 2025. This indicates that the company is more likely to reduce its share count than to issue new shares that would dilute existing shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In recent earnings calls and investor presentations, management has been open about the company's challenges, such as the need to improve profitability at Braintree and the decline in transaction numbers. CEO Alex Chriss has articulated a new strategy focused on profitable growth and has been transparent about the steps being taken to achieve this.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal is subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny, as is common for a company of its size in the financial services industry. The company is currently cooperating with investigations by the FTC and the CFPB. While these investigations do not in themselves indicate a lack of integrity, they do represent a risk and prevent an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity at this time.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:

PayPal scores positively on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market potential, profitability, financial strength, and competitive advantages. The company's two-sided network, strong brand, and global reach provide a solid foundation for future growth. Management appears to be taking credible steps to address recent challenges by focusing on profitable growth and margin improvement. However, the score is negatively impacted by recent workforce reductions, which could affect personnel relations, and ongoing regulatory investigations that cast a shadow on the company's integrity. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the "PayPal Everywhere" initiative in driving offline transaction growth and the outcomes of the current regulatory investigations. A "No" on R&D Effectiveness and Sales Organization could flip to "Yes" if the company can demonstrate a sustained increase in user engagement and transaction growth.

fisher score is 9 / 15
