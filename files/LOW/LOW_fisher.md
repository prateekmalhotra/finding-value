**Synthesis**

Lowe's scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong marks for its market potential, commitment to development, and financial strength. The company's focus on the "Pro" customer and its investments in its supply chain are key long-term growth drivers. The biggest variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the health of the housing market, as a significant downturn could impact sales and profitability. Additionally, a "No" for R&D effectiveness could be changed to a "Yes" with more disclosure around technology investments and their returns.

fisher score is 14 / 15
