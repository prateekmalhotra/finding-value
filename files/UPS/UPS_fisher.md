United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS), August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS is strategically focused on high-growth, high-margin segments including healthcare, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), and international markets. The company is actively investing in these areas, as evidenced by its January 2025 acquisition of Frigo-Trans, a complex healthcare logistics provider, and its pending acquisition of Andlauer Healthcare Group to enhance its cold-chain capabilities. The continued growth of its Digital Access Program, which embeds shipping solutions into e-commerce platforms, effectively captures the expanding SMB market. While the core U.S. package market is mature, these specialized logistics and international e-commerce services provide a clear path for sustained sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment is demonstrated through its "Innovation Driven" strategy, focusing on technology and network optimization. Key initiatives include the "Network of the Future" and the "Network Reconfiguration," which use automation and consolidation to improve efficiency. The company is also developing new products, such as "Ground Saver," an insourced economy ground service, and "Ground with Freight Pricing" for shipments over 150 pounds, showing a focus on expanding its service portfolio to meet evolving customer needs.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS's research and development is integrated into its capital expenditures on technology and network automation rather than a standalone R&D line item. For the twelve months ending June 30, 2025, UPS reported capital expenditures of $3.94 billion. Research indicates that UPS has 54% lower capital expenditure requirements as a percentage of revenue than its primary competitor, FedEx, suggesting a more mature and efficient investment strategy. The effectiveness of this spending is demonstrated by tangible outcomes like the "Smart Package Smart Facility" RFID initiative, which improves network visibility and reduces manual scans, directly contributing to operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "Customer First" strategy pillar emphasizes building long-term customer relationships. In 2024, UPS served 1.6 million shipping customers daily. A key success is its Digital Access Program, which has effectively penetrated the SMB market, a stated strategic priority. Furthermore, securing the contract to be the primary air cargo provider for the U.S. Postal Service demonstrates the sales organization's ability to win large, complex, and high-volume contracts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the quarter ending March 31, 2025, UPS reported a consolidated operating margin of 7.7%. For the full year 2024, the operating margin was 9.3%. While these margins are substantial, they represent a decline from the 10.0% margin reported in 2023. Compared to its main competitor, FedEx, which reported a TTM operating margin of 6.65% as of August 2025, UPS maintains a superior margin profile, indicating greater operational efficiency. However, the recent downward trend prevents an unqualified "Yes".
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm) (Filed April 23, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE45umArtO8UTeFG1weFenmi3mYpfVl7-amai9R1s0NZ1UHzwMNFeQtsdCTlXVFeJbhIMGrwqGkQbY16siRMU5eC3ff4lWX4iCjZ7KTIxs7xJfmuw9o415pR3HQ-ubgRWFz2cFtsP8hhsNazBX9wG2yhg==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE45umArtO8UTeFG1weFenmi3mYpfVl7-amai9R1s0NZ1UHzwMNFeQtsdCTlXVFeJbhIMGrwqGkQbY16siRMU5eC3ff4lWX4iCjZ7KTIxs7xJfmuw9o415pR3HQ-ubgRWFz2cFtsP8hhsNazBX9wG2yhg==)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS is aggressively pursuing margin improvement through multiple initiatives. The "Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined" programs aim to deliver $3.5 billion in cost savings in 2025 through facility consolidation and process redesign. Strategically, the company is shifting its focus from lower-yielding volume toward higher-margin business in the healthcare and SMB sectors. This includes a planned volume reduction with its largest customer. Furthermore, the company exercises pricing power through annual rate increases, such as the average 5.9% net increase implemented in December 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm) (Filed April 23, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS successfully ratified a new five-year contract with the Teamsters in 2023, avoiding a major strike and securing labor stability through July 2028. However, the negotiations were contentious and caused some customer volume diversion. More significantly, the company is undertaking large-scale workforce reductions. The "Fit to Serve" initiative cut approximately 14,000 management positions in 2024, and the "Network Reconfiguration" plans will reduce the workforce by another 20,000 positions in 2025. Such extensive, ongoing layoffs create an environment of uncertainty and likely harm employee morale, making a conclusion of "outstanding" relations untenable.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm) (Filed April 23, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, led by CEO Carol Tomé since 2020, has demonstrated stability and a consistent strategic vision. The "Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven" strategy is consistently communicated across all recent filings, indicating strong alignment among the leadership team. The company's detailed strategic plans and financial targets for 2026, laid out during its Investor and Analyst conference, further suggest a cohesive and forward-looking executive team. There are no public reports or disclosures indicating significant friction or instability within the executive ranks.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS has a deep bench of experienced executives leading its key business segments and functional areas, as detailed in its annual report. The company has a long-standing culture of promoting from within, which cultivates deep institutional knowledge and operational expertise. The detailed operational and financial discussions for each segment (U.S. Domestic, International, Supply Chain Solutions) in SEC filings reflect capable leadership managing each distinct business unit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, provided an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. However, the 10-K also discloses a settlement with the SEC in November 2024 regarding the company's controls and practices surrounding impairment analyses connected to the 2021 divestiture of UPS Freight. While the company settled without admitting or denying the findings and management has certified its controls as effective since, this past issue indicates a prior weakness in a key area of accounting judgment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS's single, integrated global air and ground network is its most significant competitive advantage in the logistics industry. This "Global Smart Logistics Network" creates network density and efficiencies of scale that are extremely difficult and capital-intensive for competitors to replicate. This integration allows for superior operational efficiency compared to competitors who run separate networks for different services. This structural advantage is a key indicator of the company's outstanding position in the industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is clearly prioritizing long-term profitability over short-term metrics. The decision to reduce volume with its largest customer is a deliberate strategy to improve margin mix at the expense of near-term revenue. Similarly, multi-billion-dollar, multi-year investments in network reconfiguration and automation ("Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined") are designed for durable, long-term cost savings and efficiency, even if they require significant upfront capital and complexity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm) (Filed April 23, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, with significant cash generation and access to capital markets. UPS generated $10.1 billion in net cash from operating activities in 2024. Far from issuing equity, the company is actively returning capital to shareholders; it has a $5.0 billion share repurchase authorization and bought back $1.0 billion in shares in Q1 2025 alone. This demonstrates that the company can comfortably fund its capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends from operating cash flow and debt without needing to dilute shareholders with equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm) (Filed April 23, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its public disclosures. The MD&A section of its SEC filings provides detailed explanations for business challenges, including the impact of "challenging macroeconomic conditions," the strategic reduction in volume from its largest customer, and cost pressures. The company's earnings call transcripts further show management openly addressing difficult topics and providing detailed answers to analyst questions about volume declines and margin pressures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm) (Filed April 23, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/UPS/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/UPS/transcripts/)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While there are no indications of widespread or ongoing ethical issues, the standard is "unquestionable integrity." The November 2024 SEC settlement related to the company's controls and practices for impairment analyses in 2021 raises a question. Although the company did not admit or deny the findings, a settlement related to financial controls and procedures is a blemish. Additionally, the company is under investigation by California authorities regarding hazardous waste disposal, though it expects to settle for an immaterial amount. These items, particularly the SEC matter, prevent a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm) (Filed February 18, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000049/ups-20250331.htm) (Filed April 23, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
UPS scores well on strategic focus, long-term orientation, and financial strength. The company's strongest positive attributes are its clear strategy to pursue higher-margin growth in healthcare and SMBs, its willingness to sacrifice short-term volume for long-term profitability, and its powerful, efficient, integrated logistics network. The primary negatives stem from execution and external pressures: declining operating margins, strained labor relations due to massive layoffs, and blemishes on its record from an SEC settlement over accounting controls.

Over the next 12–24 months, the variables most likely to change the score are the success of the "Network Reconfiguration" cost-saving program and the trend in operating margins. Evidence of sustained margin stabilization and improvement (flipping Point 5 to "Yes") and a smooth execution of the workforce reduction without significant operational disruption or labor strife (improving the outlook for Point 7) would materially improve the company's score. To flip the "No" on integrity (Point 15) to a "Yes," UPS would need a multi-year period free of any new regulatory or accounting control issues.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
