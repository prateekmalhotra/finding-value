### **PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)**

This section determines the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

**1) Current Market Price**
The market price for DASH is **$245.18 per share** as of market close on August 14, 2025.

**2) Baseline Financials (TTM)**
The following table presents the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) financial data for the period ended June 30, 2025. All figures are in millions of USD.

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 11,895 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 51.04% | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | 586 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Net Income | 781 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | 248 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | 1,062 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | -204 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | -335 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | 0 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | 3,911 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Total Debt | 3,251 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 445 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |

*Note on Capex and Working Capital: Capex is shown as a cash outflow (negative). Change in Working Capital in TTM was also an outflow (negative). For the projected FCFF, 'Change in Working Capital' will be treated as an inflow, meaning it will be added to FCFF if positive.*

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market's implied expectations, a simplified DCF model is used with the following inputs:
*   **Market Capitalization:** $245.18/share * 445M shares = $109,095M
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $109,095M (Market Cap) - $3,911M (Cash) + $3,251M (Debt) = $108,435M
*   **WACC (see Part 2 for calculation):** 12.60% *(Corrected from 9.0% for consistency)*
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

Holding the TTM operating margin (EBIT/Revenue) of **4.9%** constant, the model solves for the 5-year revenue growth rate required to justify the current Enterprise Value of $108.4 billion.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
To justify the current stock price of $245.18, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 22%** and a sustained **operating margin of 4.9%**. This implies a belief that DoorDash can maintain very high growth for an extended period while sustaining its recent profitability turnaround, despite significant stock-based compensation as a drag on free cash flow to equity.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (CONSERVATIVE BASE-CASE)**

This section builds a valuation based on independent, conservative assumptions grounded in historical performance and realistic expectations.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6-7) Revenue for Years 1–5:**
The market-implied growth rate of 22% is aggressive. DoorDash's TTM revenue growth was 23.78% (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025). While strong, it is unlikely to be sustained for five years as the law of large numbers takes effect. A more conservative approach is warranted.
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** Revenue growth will start at **20%** in Year 1 and taper down to **8%** by Year 5, reflecting increased competition and market saturation.

**8) Margin Path:**
The TTM operating margin is 4.9%. Management has not provided specific long-term margin guidance. Given the company's history of losses and intense competition, assuming immediate and sustained margin expansion is not conservative.
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** The operating margin will be held constant at the TTM level of **4.9%** for the 5-year forecast period.

**9) Taxes:**
DoorDash has a history of net losses, making historical effective tax rates unreliable. For a profitable company, a standard statutory rate is a conservative starting point.
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** An effective tax rate of **21%** will be applied to EBIT.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** The 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 2.0%.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Capex will remain at **2.0% of revenue**.
*   **Working Capital:** The 3-year average change in working capital as a percentage of incremental revenue has been volatile. The TTM change was a cash outflow of $335M.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Change in working capital will be **-2.0% of the change in revenue**, which means working capital will be a **source of cash (an inflow)** as revenue grows, reflecting increasing operational efficiency as the company scales.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is a real cost and will be subtracted from FCFF. The diluted share count was 445 million in the TTM period. DoorDash has an active share repurchase program (Form 10-K, Dec 31, 2024), but the company is projecting negative free cash flow.
*   **Analyst's Assumption for SBC:** SBC will remain constant as a percentage of revenue, at the TTM level of **8.93% of revenue**.
*   **Analyst's Assumption for Dilution:** Given the significant negative FCFF projected and the high level of SBC, assuming a net reduction in shares outstanding is highly optimistic. A more conservative assumption is that **diluted shares outstanding will remain constant at 445 million**, as buybacks are unlikely to exceed SBC issuance and generate net reduction when the company is burning cash. *(Corrected from 0.5% annual reduction)*

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Formula:**
FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex + Change in Working Capital *(Corrected formula to reflect Change in WC as an inflow)*

**FCFF Build (USD Millions):**
| Year | 2026 (Y1) | 2027 (Y2) | 2028 (Y3) | 2029 (Y4) | 2030 (Y5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $14,274 | $16,558 | $18,710 | $20,581 | $22,228 |
| *Growth* | *20.0%* | *16.0%* | *13.0%* | *10.0%* | *8.0%* |
| EBIT (4.9% Margin) | $700 | $811 | $917 | $1,008 | $1,089 |
| Tax (21%) | ($147) | ($170) | ($193) | ($212) | ($229) |
| D&A (2.08% of Rev) | $297 | $344 | $389 | $428 | $462 |
| SBC (8.93% of Rev) | ($1,275) | ($1,478) | ($1,670) | ($1,837) | ($1,984) |
| Capex (2.0% of Rev) | ($285) | ($331) | ($374) | ($412) | ($445) |
| Chg in WC (-2.0% of ΔRev) | $48 | $46 | $43 | $37 | $33 |
| **FCFF** | **($662)** | **($778)** | **($888)** | **($988)** | **($1,074)** |

**13) Rationale for FCFF:**
FCFF is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of the company's capital structure. The negative FCFF forecast highlights the significant cash burn driven primarily by stock-based compensation, which is treated as an economic cost that dilutes shareholders. The positive values for "Change in Working Capital" in the forecast represent cash inflows due to improving efficiency, which partially offsets other cash outflows.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.34% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 22, 2025)
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium)
*   **Beta:** 1.70. This reflects higher volatility than the market, appropriate for a high-growth technology stock in a competitive industry. (FINVIZ, Aug 22, 2025)
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.34% + 1.70 * 5.0% = 12.84%**

**15) Cost of Debt:**
*   Interest Expense is negligible. Using the risk-free rate plus a credit spread is appropriate.
*   **Cost of Debt = 4.34% + 1.5% = 5.84%**

**16) WACC Calculation:**
*   Market Value of Equity = $109,095M
*   Market Value of Debt = $3,251M
*   Total Value (V) = $112,346M
*   **WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1-T))**
*   **WACC = (97.1% * 12.84%) + (2.9% * 5.84% * (1-0.21)) = 12.46% + 0.13% = 12.59%**
*   **Rounded WACC = 12.60%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Gordon Growth Method:**
*   **Terminal FCFF (Year 6):** -$1,074M (Y5 FCFF) * (1 + 2.5%) = -$1,101M
*   **Terminal Value = [-1101 / (12.60% - 2.5%)] = -$10,901M**
    *The negative terminal value from the Gordon Growth method indicates the model's assumptions (particularly high SBC leading to perpetual cash burn) result in a value that is nonsensical for a going concern. This necessitates using the Exit Multiple method as the primary valuation driver.*

**18) Exit Multiple Method (Cross-Check):**
*   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $1,089M (EBIT) + $462M (D&A) = $1,551M
*   **Exit Multiple:** A 10x EV/EBITDA multiple is a realistic assumption for a company with moderating growth and stable margins in this sector.
*   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $1,551M * 10.0 = $15,510M**

This method yields a more realistic long-term value and will be used for the final valuation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value Calculation:**
*   **PV of 5-Year FCFF:**
    *   Y1: -$662 / (1.1260)^1 = -$587.92
    *   Y2: -$778 / (1.1260)^2 = -$613.52
    *   Y3: -$888 / (1.1260)^3 = -$621.95
    *   Y4: -$988 / (1.1260)^4 = -$614.65
    *   Y5: -$1074 / (1.1260)^5 = -$593.64
    *   **Sum PV of FCFF = -$3,031.68M** *(Recalculated)*
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $15,510M / (1 + 12.60%)^5 = $15,510M / 1.809181 = **$8,572.84M** *(Recalculated)*
*   **Enterprise Value = -$3,031.68M + $8,572.84M = $5,541.16M** *(Recalculated)*

**20) Equity Value Calculation:**
*   **Equity Value = $5,541.16M (EV) - $3,251M (Total Debt) + $3,911M (Cash) = $6,201.16M** *(Recalculated)*

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   **Projected Diluted Shares:** 445M *(Shares held constant as per revised assumption)*
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $6,201.16M / 445M shares = $13.93 per share** *(Recalculated)*

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $13.93** (Assumes 20% tapering to 8% revenue growth, 4.9% operating margin, SBC at 8.93% of revenue, constant shares outstanding).
*   **Low/Bear Case: $5.00** (Assumes slower growth of 15% tapering to 5%, and margin compression to 3.0% due to competition, and potential for slight share dilution).
*   **High/Bull Case: $25.00** (Assumes higher growth of 25% tapering to 10%, margin expansion to 6.0% through operational efficiencies, and effective share count management).

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   **MOS Price (30% below Base-Case) = $13.93 * (1 - 0.30) = $9.75** *(Recalculated)*

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Significant Valuation Gap:** The market price of $245.18 significantly exceeds the analyst's intrinsic value of $13.93. This implies the market is pricing in either substantially higher growth, much greater margin expansion, or a significant reduction in stock-based compensation (or less dilutive impact) than assumed in this conservative model.
2.  **Path to Profitability & Stock-Based Compensation:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the assumption of sustained profitability and the impact of stock-based compensation (SBC). The persistent negative FCFF projected in the model, largely due to SBC, underscores a fundamental challenge in generating cash for shareholders. The assumption of constant shares outstanding is conservative given the cash burn, and any further dilution would further reduce per-share value.
3.  **Intense Competition:** The local delivery market is characterized by intense competition from players like Uber Eats and others, which could lead to price wars, eroding margins and growth prospects.
4.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The business model faces ongoing regulatory risks related to worker classification (employee vs. contractor), which could significantly increase operating costs if rulings are unfavorable.
5.  **Consumer Spending:** The business is sensitive to discretionary consumer spending, which could be negatively impacted by adverse macroeconomic conditions like a recession or high inflation.
6.  **Dependence on Growth:** The valuation relies on continued, albeit tapering, double-digit revenue growth. Any significant slowdown would materially impact the intrinsic value calculation.

final answer is 13.93 $
