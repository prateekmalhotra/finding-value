### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Charles Schwab Corporation operates in the vast U.S. investable wealth market, which management estimates to be over $75 trillion. With $10.1 trillion in client assets as of year-end 2024, Schwab has a significant but not dominant share, leaving substantial room for expansion. The company continues to demonstrate strong organic growth, attracting $137.7 billion in core net new assets in the first quarter of 2025 alone, a 44% increase from the prior year. This consistent asset gathering in a large and growing market indicates a long runway for future sales increases.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab has a history of disrupting the industry and expanding its service offerings. The successful integration of TD Ameritrade's platforms, including the launch of Schwab Trading Powered by Ameritrade™ incorporating the thinkorswim platform, demonstrates a commitment to enhancing its product suite. The company has also recently introduced innovative services like Schwab Personalized Indexing® and Schwab Investing Themes®, aimed at providing clients with more customized investment solutions. These actions show a clear focus on evolving its offerings to meet client needs and capture new market segments.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a financial services firm, Schwab does not report R&D as a separate line item. However, its capital expenditures on technology and software are substantial, totaling $607 million in 2024. The effectiveness of this spending is demonstrated by the successful and large-scale integration of Ameritrade's $1.9 trillion in client assets and 17 million accounts, a significant technological and operational undertaking. The company also continues to receive industry awards for its platforms and tools, such as the #1 rank for Charting Technology from Stockbrokers.com in 2025, indicating that its technology investments are competitive and effective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab's ability to consistently gather assets serves as a proxy for a strong sales function. In the first quarter of 2025, the company attracted $137.7 billion in core net new assets, representing a 5.5% annualized growth rate. The company also added 4.2 million new brokerage accounts in 2024, ending the year with 36.5 million active accounts. This sustained, high-volume growth in both assets and clients across its retail (Investor Services) and institutional (Advisor Services) segments points to a highly effective, above-average sales and marketing organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab consistently maintains high profit margins. For the full year 2024, the company reported a pre-tax profit margin of 39.2%. This strong performance continued into 2025, with the pre-tax margin improving to 43.8% in the first quarter. These margins are robust for any industry and indicate significant operating leverage and pricing power in its business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on efficiency and cost control to improve margins. The company has realized approximately $2.0 billion in annualized run-rate cost synergies from the Ameritrade integration. Furthermore, Schwab initiated a separate restructuring plan in 2023, involving position eliminations and reducing its real estate footprint, to achieve an additional $500 million in incremental run-rate cost savings. These decisive actions demonstrate a clear strategy to maintain and enhance profitability by managing the expense base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab is frequently recognized as a top employer, receiving the 2025 Gallup Exceptional Workplace Award and being named one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies for 2025. The company's 2024 10-K details a comprehensive compensation package, career development programs, and employee resource groups designed to attract and retain talent. While the company undertook layoffs as part of its 2023 restructuring, the consistent external awards for its workplace culture suggest that, on balance, labor and personnel relations are a strength.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab's leadership team exhibits stability and experience. Key executives, including the CEO, CFO, and CIO, possess extensive industry experience, with many having served long tenures at Schwab or other major financial institutions. The board of directors also shows stability, with an average tenure of 11.8 years, suggesting a cohesive and well-functioning governance structure. This longevity and depth within the executive ranks and board indicate strong and stable relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public leadership roster showcases a deep bench of experienced executives beyond the CEO. Key roles such as the Chief Financial Officer (Mike Verdeschi), Chief Information Officer (Dennis Howard), and CEO of Schwab Asset Management (Omar Aguilar) are held by individuals with decades of relevant experience. The structure includes managing directors for key divisions like Advisor Services (Jonathan Beatty) and Operations (Jason Clague), indicating clear lines of responsibility and a deep pool of senior talent to manage the business and mitigate key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab's financial reporting appears robust and transparent. The 2024 10-K includes a statement from management affirming the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting, and the report is audited by a reputable firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. The company provides detailed segment information, breaking down revenues and expenses for its Investor Services and Advisor Services divisions, which allows for clear cost and profitability analysis. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the investment services industry, scale is a critical competitive advantage, and Schwab is one of the largest players with $10.1 trillion in client assets. This massive asset base allows the company to spread costs widely, enabling it to be a price leader (e.g., low-cost funds and commissions) while maintaining high profitability. The company's "willingness to disrupt," as stated in its 10-K, has allowed it to consistently take market share by challenging industry fee structures, a key differentiator in a largely commoditized industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab's corporate strategy, described as "Through Clients' Eyes," prioritizes long-term client relationships over short-term profit maximization. This is evidenced by its history of disruptive, client-friendly actions, such as eliminating trading commissions, which can reduce near-term revenue but attract significant client assets for future monetization. Management's commentary consistently emphasizes that building trusted relationships is the best way to "build long-term stockholder value," indicating a clear long-range focus.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Schwab's financial position is strong, and its recent capital actions have been anti-dilutive. The company generated $2.7 billion in cash from operations in 2024. More notably, in February 2025, Schwab repurchased $1.5 billion of its common stock and has approximately $7.2 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization. This demonstrates both the ability and the willingness to return capital to shareholders rather than needing to issue equity to fund operations or growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its disclosures. The Risk Factors and MD&A sections of the 10-K provide a transparent discussion of the challenges faced in 2022-2023 due to rising interest rates, noting that "the Company utilized higher-cost supplemental funding sources, which negatively impacted the Company's net income." This willingness to openly discuss negative impacts on profitability, rather than just focusing on positives like asset growth, shows a commitment to candid communication with investors. The long history of providing earnings call transcripts further supports this.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Schwab has a strong reputation, recent regulatory actions prevent a perfect score. In January 2025, the SEC announced that Charles Schwab & Co., Inc. agreed to pay a $10 million penalty to settle charges related to failures to maintain and preserve electronic communications ("off-channel communications"). This follows a more significant 2022 settlement for $187 million related to misleading disclosures for its robo-advisory product. While these issues do not necessarily indicate a systemic lack of integrity, they are significant compliance failures that question whether management's integrity is "unquestionable."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### Synthesis

The Charles Schwab Corporation scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its dominant market position, strong financial model, and client-focused growth strategy. The company's primary strengths lie in its massive scale, which provides a significant cost advantage, its consistent ability to attract new assets, and its robust profit margins. Management has also proven its commitment to long-term value creation through strategic acquisitions and a willingness to disrupt industry norms for client benefit.

The primary negative is the "No" for unquestionable integrity, stemming from recent multi-million dollar SEC penalties. While not existential, these regulatory issues prevent a perfect score and represent a blemish on an otherwise strong governance and operational record. The variables most likely to change the overall score in the next 12–24 months are related to the macroeconomic environment and margin management. A significant shift in interest rates could impact net interest margins and client cash allocation behavior, while the continued realization of cost savings from its restructuring programs will be critical to sustaining profitability. To flip the "No" to a "Yes," Schwab would need a multi-year period free of any material regulatory fines or findings of misleading conduct, demonstrating that the recent compliance failures have been fully remediated.

**Fisher Score is 14 / 15**
