Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Q1 2026 Earnings Release (ended May 31, 2025), FY2025 Earnings Release (ended February 28, 2025), Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript (July 23, 2025), and Form 20-F Filing Announcement (June 9, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Karooooo, through its main subsidiary Cartrack, operates in the growing operational IoT SaaS market. The company reported a 17% year-over-year increase in total subscribers to nearly 2.4 million in Q1 2026. This growth is accelerating, particularly in Southeast Asia, which management has identified as its largest growth opportunity. The consistent addition of subscribers (84,013 net new in Q1 2026) indicates a large and underpenetrated addressable market for fleet management, asset tracking, and data analytics.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Karooooo is actively investing to scale its platform and services. In Q1 2026, management noted increased investment in sales capacity and infrastructure to drive growth. The company is also expanding its Karooooo Logistics segment, which saw a 20% revenue increase, indicating diversification beyond the core Cartrack offerings. This commitment to investing in new growth areas, even at the expense of short-term margin, points to a long-term development strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the specific R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue is not detailed in the available documents, the output is evident in the company's platform capabilities. Karooooo's platform processes over 200 billion data points monthly, powering analytics for fleet management, workforce optimization, and logistics. The continuous growth in SaaS Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR), up 18.3% in Q1 2026, suggests the platform remains competitive and valued by customers. The ability to scale to over 2.4 million subscribers demonstrates effective technology infrastructure.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales results are strong and accelerating. Cartrack's subscription revenue growth accelerated to 19% in Q1 2026, up from 16% in the prior year's comparable quarter. This was driven by a record 84,013 net subscriber additions in the quarter, an 11% increase in additions year-over-year. This performance, especially the accelerating growth across all regions, indicates a highly effective sales and marketing engine.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Karooooo demonstrates strong profitability. For Q1 2026, the company's operating profit increased 17% to ZAR 352 million. The core Cartrack segment reported a healthy operating profit margin of 30%. The company's guidance for the full fiscal year 2026 projects Cartrack's operating profit margin to be between 26% and 31%, which is substantial for a company that is also growing revenue at a high rate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.listcorp.com/asx/kro/news/unaudited-first-quarter-2026-results-and-dividend-declaration-2883447.html](https://www.listcorp.com/asx/kro/news/unaudited-first-quarter-2026-results-and-dividend-declaration-2883447.html) (July 23, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KARO/transcripts/4e5e43a9-3178-11ef-931b-df73c3b06380](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KARO/transcripts/4e5e43a9-3178-11ef-931b-df73c3b06380) (July 23, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains margin discipline while investing for growth. In the Q1 2026 earnings call, they noted the Cartrack operating margin of 30% benefited from "disciplined expense management and modest ARPU growth." The company is focused on scaling its high-margin SaaS revenue, which grew 18.5% for Cartrack in Q1. Furthermore, they are strategically aiming to increase Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), particularly in South Africa, which directly contributes to margin expansion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KARO/transcripts/4e5e43a9-3178-11ef-931b-df73c3b06380](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KARO/transcripts/4e5e43a9-3178-11ef-931b-df73c3b06380) (July 23, 2025), [https://www.listcorp.com/asx/kro/news/unaudited-first-quarter-2026-results-and-dividend-declaration-2883447.html](https://www.listcorp.com/asx/kro/news/unaudited-first-quarter-2026-results-and-dividend-declaration-2883447.html) (July 23, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific data in the financial filings regarding employee turnover, engagement scores, or labor disputes. The company's website mentions a global, collaborative team across more than 20 countries. Without concrete metrics on personnel relations from primary sources, it is not possible to definitively assess this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The founder, Zak Calisto, remains the CEO and appears to be the principal strategic leader. The executive team, including the CFO and Chief Strategy Officer, are consistently present on earnings calls. However, a secondary offering of 1,500,000 shares by the CEO was announced in June 2025, which can sometimes be a point of concern for investors, though the reason is not specified. Insider ownership remains very high at over 79%, which strongly aligns management with shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250722359419/en/Karooooo-Reports-Strong-Q1-2026-Results-Highlighted-By-Accelerating-Cartrack-Revenue-Growth](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250722359419/en/Karooooo-Reports-Strong-Q1-2026-Results-Highlighted-By-Accelerating-Cartrack-Revenue-Growth) (July 22, 2025), [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250714902130/en/Karooooo-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2026-Results-on-July-22-2025](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250714902130/en/Karooooo-to-Announce-First-Quarter-2026-Results-on-July-22-2025) (July 14, 2025), [https://stocktitan.net/news/KARO/karooooo-ltd-current-report-foreign-issuer-x7m656q0kj5r.html](https://stocktitan.net/news/KARO/karooooo-ltd-current-report-foreign-issuer-x7m656q0kj5r.html) (July 30, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The primary voice in all investor communications is the founder and CEO, Zak Calisto. The CFO, Hoeshin Goy, and Chief Strategy Officer, Carmen Calisto, are also involved in earnings presentations. While the executive team appears stable, the public filings do not provide significant detail on the management bench strength below the C-suite or discuss succession planning. The heavy reliance on the founder presents a potential key-person risk.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KARO/transcripts/4e5e43a9-3178-11ef-931b-df73c3b06380](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KARO/transcripts/4e5e43a9-3178-11ef-931b-df73c3b06380) (July 23, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Karooooo files reports with the SEC as a foreign private issuer, adhering to IFRS standards. The company's auditor for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2025, was Deloitte, which provided an unqualified audit opinion, indicating the financial statements are fairly and appropriately presented. The company provides segmented revenue data for Cartrack and Karooooo Logistics, and breaks out key metrics like subscription revenue, offering a degree of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.listcorp.com/asx/kro/news/karooooo-ltd-s-annual-report-on-form-20-f-for-the-year-ended-28-february-2025-2840502.html](https://www.listcorp.com/asx/kro/news/karooooo-ltd-s-annual-report-on-form-20-f-for-the-year-ended-28-february-2025-2840502.html) (June 9, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the SaaS fleet management industry, scale and data are key differentiators. Karooooo's platform has over 2.4 million subscribers, providing a massive data asset that creates a network effect, improving the platform's analytics and insights. This scale, combined with a vertically integrated business model where they control the hardware and software, allows for strong unit economics and competitive pricing. The company's consistent "Rule of 60" performance (Revenue Growth % + FCF Margin %), mentioned in the Q1 2026 transcript, is a strong indicator of its superior operational efficiency versus peers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management explicitly prioritizes long-term growth. Their guidance for FY2026 notes an expectation for "lower Earnings Per Share growth...given our planned upfront investment in sales and marketing for the year." This demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice short-term profits to expand their distribution footprint and capture market share for the long term. This is consistent with their strategy of aggressively growing their subscriber base, particularly in high-potential markets like Southeast Asia.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is very strong. As of Q1 2026, the balance sheet is "unleveraged" and the company ended the quarter with net cash and cash equivalents of ZAR 1,103 million. The business model is described as "consistently profitable" and "highly cash generative." Given the strong internal cash generation, it is highly unlikely the company would need to issue equity to fund its organic growth plans.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management communicates with a consistent rhythm through press releases, filings, and quarterly earnings calls. They provide forward-looking guidance for revenue, margins, and EPS, and are open about their investment plans potentially dampening short-term EPS growth. While the company has not faced a major public crisis recently, this level of transparency in setting expectations is a positive sign of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags such as major lawsuits, regulatory actions, or accounting scandals apparent in the recent financial filings. The company has its financials audited by a major firm (Deloitte) with an unqualified opinion. The high level of insider ownership by the founder, while creating key-person risk, also suggests a strong commitment to the company's long-term success. The recent secondary share sale by the CEO is a point to monitor but is not in itself an indicator of a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Karooooo Ltd. scores well on Fisher's checklist, exhibiting strong, profitable growth fueled by a large addressable market for its IoT SaaS platform. Its key strengths are a scalable and highly profitable business model, a long runway for growth demonstrated by accelerating subscriber additions, and a strong, unleveraged balance sheet that eliminates financing risk. The founder-led management team is aligned with shareholders through massive insider ownership and demonstrates a clear long-term focus by prioritizing market share gains over short-term earnings. The primary weaknesses are a lack of disclosure on management depth beyond the CEO and key executives, creating a potential key-person risk, and no available data on personnel relations. The score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on the success of its investment in Asia-Pacific; sustained high growth in this region would confirm the long runway thesis, while a slowdown could raise questions. A "No" on management depth could flip to a "Yes" with formal disclosures around succession planning or by elevating the profiles of other key operational leaders within the organization.

fisher score is 13 / 15
