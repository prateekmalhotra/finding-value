In the third quarter of 2025, the company reported a 10.1% increase in service revenues, driven by higher average selling prices and volume growth.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Copart has a strong balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow.

This strong financial position allows the company to fund its growth initiatives without needing to issue new shares, which would dilute existing shareholders.

---
Synthesis: Copart appears to be a high-quality company with a strong competitive position, a long runway for growth, and a solid financial position. The company's key strengths are its extensive physical network, its leading online auction platform, and its strong relationships with insurance companies. The biggest variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are a downturn in the used car market, increased competition, or a failure to execute on its international expansion plans. A "No" would flip to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness with more disclosure from the company on innovation metrics, and for labor relations and management depth with more transparency.

fisher score is 11 / 15
