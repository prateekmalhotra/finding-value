### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are priced into AutoNation's stock as of August 22, 2025.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$210.31** (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025, 4:00 PM)
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM ended June 30, 2025):**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $27,464 | StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement |

| Change in Working Capital | $1,233.0 | StockAnalysis.com, Cash Flow Statement |
| Interest Expense | $384.2 | StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement |
| Cash & Equivalents | $70.5 | Form 10-Q, March 31, 2025 |

| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 40.0 | StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the market's expectations, we solve for the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) growth rate that equates the discounted cash flow (DCF) model's output to the current enterprise value.

*   **Enterprise Value:** Market Cap ($210.31 x 40.0M shares) + Total Debt ($9,305.0) - Cash ($70.5) = **$17,646.9M**
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** **5.77%** (Calculation in Appendix)
*   **Baseline FCFF (TTM):** **$1,052.3M** (Unlevered Free Cash Flow from StockAnalysis.com, Cash Flow Statement)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5% (long-run inflation estimate)

**Market-Implied Growth Rate:**
Solving the DCF valuation for the 5-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) that yields the current enterprise value results in an implied FCFF growth rate of approximately **-10.5% per year**.

Assuming profitability and capital intensity ratios remain constant at trailing-twelve-month levels, this implies the market is pricing in a **revenue contraction of approximately 10.5% annually for the next five years.** This is a deeply pessimistic outlook, suggesting that either the market expects significant revenue and margin erosion or that the reported TTM free cash flow, which is influenced by the company's financing arm, is not considered sustainable.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds an intrinsic value estimate using independent, conservative assumptions grounded in historical performance and management commentary.

**C) FORECAST & ASSUMPTIONS**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **3.0%, tapering to 2.5%** | The market's implied -10.5% growth is overly pessimistic. Recent same-store sales grew 4.3% (Q1 2025 10-Q), and industry sales are up. A modest 3.0% growth, tapering to the terminal rate, reflects normalization. |
| **Operating Margin** | **5.0%** | The TTM margin is 5.07%. Margins have compressed from a high of 7.6% in 2022, and management expects further moderation (Q1 2025 10-Q). A flat 5.0% is a conservative assumption against this trend. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **25.0%** | The 3-year average effective tax rate is approximately 24.6%. 25.0% is a normalized, conservative rate. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.3%** | This aligns with the 3-year historical average of 1.3% (2022-2024). |
| **SBC** | **$40.4M** (Held constant) | Based on the TTM value, treated as a cash expense. |
| **Δ in NWC as % of Δ in Revenue** | **12.5%** | Based on the average NWC/Revenue ratio for 2023-2024, separating core operations from the auto financing arm's loan growth. |
| **Shares for Valuation**| **37.71M** | Latest filing date shares outstanding provide a more current count (June 30, 2025). |

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD Millions) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $28,287.9 | $29,108.3 | $29,953.5 | $30,822.2 | $31,671.7 |
| EBIT (5.0% Margin) | $1,414.4 | $1,455.4 | $1,497.7 | $1,541.1 | $1,583.6 |
| EBIT * (1-Tax Rate) | $1,060.8 | $1,091.6 | $1,123.3 | $1,155.8 | $1,187.7 |
| \+ D&A (0.9% of Rev) | $254.6 | $262.0 | $269.6 | $277.4 | $285.0 |
| \- SBC | $40.4 | $40.4 | $40.4 | $40.4 | $40.4 |
| \- Capex (1.3% of Rev) | $367.7 | $378.4 | $389.4 | $400.7 | $411.7 |
| \- Δ in NWC (12.5% of Δ Rev) | $102.9 | $102.6 | $105.7 | $108.6 | $106.2 |
| **FCFF** | **$804.4** | **$832.2** | **$857.4** | **$883.5** | **$914.4** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

The WACC calculated in Part 1 is used, as the inputs are based on current market data.
*   **WACC = 5.77%** (See Appendix for calculation)

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

1.  **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Formula: `TV = [FCFF_5 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)`
    *   Inputs: FCFF_5 = $914.4M; g = 2.5%; WACC = 5.77%
    *   TV = [$914.4 * (1.025)] / (0.0577 - 0.025) = **$28,541.2M**

2.  **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $1,583.6M + $285.0M = $1,868.6M
    *   Conservative Exit Multiple = **8.5x** (below the 13-year median of 10.2x).
    *   Implied Terminal Value = $1,868.6M * 8.5 = **$15,883.1M**

The Gordon Growth method yields a significantly higher terminal value. Given the cyclical nature of the industry, the exit multiple approach provides a more conservative and grounded valuation. The analysis will proceed using the **Exit Multiple Terminal Value of $15,883.1M**.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

1.  **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:**
    *   PV = ($804.4 / 1.0577¹) + ($832.2 / 1.0577²) + ... + ($914.4 / 1.0577⁵) = **$3,612.3M**
2.  **PV of Terminal Value:**
    *   PV = $15,883.1M / (1.0577)⁵ = **$11,990.2M**
3.  **Enterprise Value:**
    *   EV = $3,612.3M + $11,990.2M = **$15,602.5M**
4.  **Equity Value:**
    *   Formula: `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($9,305.0M) - Cash ($70.5M) = $9,234.5M
    *   Equity Value = $15,602.5M - $9,234.5M = **$6,368.0M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

1.  **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Formula: `Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   Fair Value = $6,368.0M / 37.71M shares = **$168.87 per share**

2.  **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $168.87:** Assumes modest 3% revenue growth and stable 5.0% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$125:** Assumes 0% revenue growth and margin compression to 4.5%, with a lower 7.5x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$215:** Assumes 5% revenue growth tapering to 3%, stable 5.5% EBIT margins, and a 9.5x exit multiple.

3.  **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   MOS Price = $168.87 * (1 - 0.30) = **$118.21**

---

**RISK NOTES**

*   **Margin Compression:** The primary risk is continued pressure on new and used vehicle margins due to increased inventory supply and competition, which could drive profitability below the 5.0% forecast.
*   **Cyclical Downturn:** The auto retail industry is highly sensitive to economic conditions. A recession could significantly reduce consumer demand for vehicles, impacting revenue growth.
*   **Financing Arm Risk:** The rapid growth of the AutoNation Finance loan portfolio introduces credit risk. Higher-than-expected loan losses could negatively impact earnings and cash flow.
*   **OEM Dependence:** AutoNation relies on franchise agreements with a few key manufacturers. Any adverse changes in these relationships or a manufacturer's brand health could harm segment performance.

**Appendix: WACC Calculation**

*   **Cost of Equity (Ke):** 4.33% (Risk-Free Rate) + 0.89 (Beta) * 5.0% (Equity Risk Premium) = **8.78%**
*   **Cost of Debt (Kd):** $384.2M (Interest Expense) / $9,305.0M (Total Debt) = 4.13%. After-tax = 4.13% * (1 - 25.0%) = **3.10%**
*   **Weights:** Market Cap = $8,412.4M; Debt = $9,305.0M. E/(E+D) = 47.5%; D/(E+D) = 52.5%.
*   **WACC:** (47.5% * 8.78%) + (52.5% * 3.10%) = **5.77%**

final answer is 168.87 $
