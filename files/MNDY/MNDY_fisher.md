**Reasoning & Evidence:** monday.com's sales performance metrics appear strong. The overall Net Dollar Retention Rate was 111% as of June 30, 2025, and rises to 115% for customers with more than 10 users, indicating effective upselling and cross-selling. The number of customers paying over $50,000 in annual recurring revenue (ARR) grew 36% year-over-year to 3,702.

Furthermore, its adjusted free cash flow margin is particularly strong, projected to be between 26% and 27% for the full year 2025.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is achieving margin improvement through operating leverage as it scales. A key driver is the move upmarket to larger enterprise customers, who typically have higher retention rates and greater expansion potential, leading to more efficient sales and marketing spend over time. The company's platform model, which allows customers to build their own solutions, and a growing partner ecosystem also provide scalable and efficient growth levers that support margin expansion. Management's focus on "eliminating redundant and costly apps" for customers points to a value proposition that also supports pricing power.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company disclosed having 2,867 employees as of June 30, 2025. The 2024 Form 20-F, filed March 17, 2025, describes the company culture as crucial to its success and notes its investment in employees. While direct metrics on attrition or engagement are not available in the provided filings, there are no mentions of significant labor disputes or issues.

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** monday.com has been led by its co-founders and co-CEOs, Roy Mann and Eran Zinman, since its inception, providing a high degree of stability and consistent vision at the top. The long tenure of the founders is a strong positive indicator. Information in the 2024 Form 20-F details the executive team and board structure, showing no signs of unusual turnover or instability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations website and annual report list a full executive team beyond the two co-CEOs, including a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Revenue Officer, and Chief Product Officer. This indicates a professionalized management structure with clear functional leaders. The company's ability to scale rapidly and expand into multiple product lines suggests a capable and deep bench of operational leadership.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's annual financial statements included in the Form 20-F (filed March 17, 2025) were audited by Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer, a member of Ernst & Young Global, which issued an unqualified opinion. There were no material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting reported. The company provides clear, segmented financial reporting and a detailed breakdown of key performance indicators in its quarterly shareholder letters.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** monday.com's key competitive advantage is the flexibility of its "Work OS" platform, which uses a low-code/no-code model. This allows organizations to create custom applications, fostering deep platform adoption and creating high switching costs. This "platform" approach, as opposed to being a rigid point solution, creates a significant ecosystem effect and a more defensible moat as more departments within a company build their workflows on monday.com.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's consistent emphasis on product innovation (such as AI) and market expansion, even while achieving profitability, points to a long-range outlook. The company's guidance balances strong growth (26% revenue growth) with healthy profitability (13% operating margin), suggesting a strategy of reinvesting for durable growth rather than maximizing short-term profit. The expansion into a multi-product platform is a multi-year investment aimed at long-term market leadership.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is in a very strong financial position. It is generating significant free cash flow, with a forecast of $320 million to $326 million for the full year 2025. A review of the balance sheet in the most recent annual report (2024 Form 20-F) shows a healthy cash position and low debt. This strong internal cash generation makes it highly unlikely the company will need to raise equity to fund its operations or growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed quarterly shareholder letters, holds regular earnings calls with Q&A sessions, and maintains a comprehensive investor relations website with presentations and supplemental data. The availability of transcripts from these calls dating back to its IPO allows for public scrutiny of management's communications. There is no evidence of a lack of candor, and the level of disclosure is consistent with a well-run public company.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the Governance section of the company's investor relations website and the Risk Factors section of the 2024 Form 20-F does not reveal any significant legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance issues that would question the integrity of the management team. The co-CEOs have successfully led the company from its founding through a public offering, suggesting a strong and stable governance track record.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
monday.com scores very well against Fisher's checklist, reflecting its strong growth, robust financial health, and stable management. The key strengths are its large market opportunity, a flexible platform-based business model that fosters customer loyalty, and an impressive ability to scale upmarket while generating significant free cash flow. The primary negative, or rather, the point with the least available evidence, is in personnel relations, where more data on employee satisfaction and turnover would be needed for a definitive "Yes." The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12–24 months by the company's ability to maintain its high growth rate as it scales and the competitive landscape for work management software evolves, particularly with AI-driven offerings. A sustained Net Dollar Retention Rate above 115% and continued margin expansion would solidify its high score, while a failure to find concrete evidence of outstanding employee relations is the most likely reason for the one "No" to persist.

fisher score is 14 / 15
