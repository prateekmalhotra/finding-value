Roku, Inc., August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku operates in the large and growing global TV streaming market. The shift from traditional linear TV to streaming is a long-term tailwind. Roku's revenue is primarily generated through its high-growth Platform segment (advertising, content distribution, and services) rather than its lower-margin Player (hardware) segment. The company continues to expand its user base, with 81.6 million active accounts as of Q1 2025, and is focused on monetizing this base through advertising and other services.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's consolidated profit margins have been under pressure.

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's key competitive advantage is its licensed operating system, which creates a network effect.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku has a solid balance sheet with a healthy cash position. The company has also generated positive free cash flow in recent periods.

---
**Synthesis:**
Roku scores well on most of Fisher's 15 points, with the main exception being its current lack of profitability. The company has a strong position in the growing streaming market, a solid balance sheet, and a management team that is focused on long-term growth. The key variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the company's ability to achieve sustained profitability. Evidence of a clear and consistent path to profitability would likely turn the "No" on point 5 to a "Yes" and significantly improve the company's overall score.

fisher score is 14 / 15
