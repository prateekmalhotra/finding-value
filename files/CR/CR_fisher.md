**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the Aerospace & Electronics segment, Crane's products are highly engineered and often sole-sourced on long-life platforms.

The company also has a share repurchase program in place, indicating it is more likely to be buying back shares than issuing them.

**Synthesis**
Crane Company scores very well against Fisher's 15 points, with the analysis indicating a high-quality business with strong long-term prospects. The company's strengths lie in its well-positioned business segments, which are aligned with secular growth trends, its commitment to innovation, and its strong financial discipline. The most significant variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months are a downturn in the aerospace cycle, which would impact the company's largest and most profitable segment, or a major operational misstep. To turn any of the "Yes" answers to a "No", there would need to be evidence of a significant deterioration in financial performance, a major product failure, a loss of key customer relationships, or a significant legal or ethical issue.

fisher score is 15 / 15
