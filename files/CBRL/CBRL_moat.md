**Assessment Incomplete**

The sustainable competitive advantage (moat) assessment for Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc. (CBRL) could not be completed. The primary data sources required for this "evidence-first" analysis, namely the company's SEC filings (10-K and 10-Q reports), were inaccessible through the available tools. Multiple attempts to browse the provided and publicly searched URLs for these documents failed.

Without access to these foundational documents, it is impossible to make the specific, dated, and verifiable claims required by the analytic framework. Proceeding with the assessment would rely on speculation and fall short of the rigorous, evidence-based standard mandated by the request. Key quantitative metrics and management discussions & analysis—critical for evaluating all ten moat dimensions—are contained within these reports.

Therefore, a defensible moat score and a credible estimation of its duration cannot be provided.

moat rating is 0 / 5
