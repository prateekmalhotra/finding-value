### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a Board-approved $500.0 million share repurchase program. As of August 6, 2024, there was $140.0 million remaining under the authorization.
*   **Mechanism:** Aggressive share repurchases will reduce the number of outstanding shares, which will increase earnings per share (EPS). Higher EPS, in turn, can lead to a higher stock price, assuming a constant price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company repurchases $50 million of stock, which at a hypothetical price of $50/share would retire 1 million shares.
    *   **Base Case:** The company repurchases the remaining $140 million, which at a hypothetical price of $50/share would retire 2.8 million shares, representing a significant portion of the outstanding shares.
    *   **High Case:** The company completes the current program and authorizes a new one.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–30%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must have sufficient cash flow and confidence in its future earnings to execute the buybacks.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on the number of shares repurchased.
    *   Announcements of any new repurchase authorizations.
    *   Free cash flow generation.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business could force the company to preserve cash and halt buybacks.
    *   The stock price could run up, making buybacks less accretive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch

**2. Catalyst Title:** New Store Openings and Remodels
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company continues to open new stores and remodel existing ones. In the first half of fiscal 2024, the company opened six new stores.
*   **Mechanism:** New stores contribute to revenue growth, and remodels can revitalize existing locations and drive increased traffic and sales. This top-line growth can lead to higher profitability and a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company opens a few new stores, but the contribution to overall revenue growth is minimal.
    *   **Base Case:** The company meets its target for new store openings, and the new stores perform in line with expectations.
    *   **High Case:** The new stores outperform expectations and the company accelerates its new store opening plans.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–30%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's ability to identify attractive new locations, negotiate favorable leases, and successfully manage the construction and opening process.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Announcements of new store openings.
    *   Comparable store sales data.
    *   New store productivity metrics.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The new stores could underperform, or the company could face delays in its opening schedule.

*   **Mechanism:** International expansion represents a significant long-term growth opportunity for the company, providing access to new markets and customers. Successful expansion could lead to a significant increase in revenue and earnings over the long term.
*   **Timing:** 2026 and beyond
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company opens a handful of international locations, but the contribution to overall revenue is not significant.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program Execution:**
*   **Formula:** (Net Income / (Outstanding Shares - Repurchased Shares)) \* P/E Multiple = Implied Share Price
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Net Income: $300 million
    *   Outstanding Shares: 40 million
    *   P/E Multiple: 15x
*   **Base Case:** The company repurchases 2.8 million shares.
    *   (300 / (40 - 2.8)) \* 15 = $121.62
*   **Conclusion:** This suggests a significant potential upside from the current share price.

**2. New Store Openings:**
*   **Formula:** (Current Revenue + (Number of New Stores \* Revenue per Store)) \* Profit Margin \* P/E Multiple / Outstanding Shares = Implied Share Price
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Revenue: $2.2 billion
    *   New Stores: 10
    *   Revenue per Store: $10 million
    *   Profit Margin: 10%
    *   P/E Multiple: 15x
    *   Outstanding Shares: 40 million
*   **Calculation:** ((2,200,000,000 + (10 \* 10,000,000)) \* 0.10 \* 15) / 40,000,000 = $86.25
*   **Conclusion:** This suggests a meaningful, but less dramatic, upside than the share repurchase scenario.
