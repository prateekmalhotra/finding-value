### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (Short)**

**1. International User Growth and Monetization**

*   **Formula:** Change in Valuation = (Increase in International Revenue x P/S Multiple) / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current International Revenue (annualized): $1.67 (Q2 2025 ARPU) x 53.7 million (Q4 2024 DAUq) x 4 = $358 million
    *   P/S Multiple: 10x (conservative estimate for a high-growth tech company)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 187.1 million (as of July 30, 2025)
*   **Base Scenario Calculation:**
    *   Increase in International Revenue: ($358 million x 1.35 x 1.20) - $358 million = $221 million
    *   Change in Valuation: ($221 million x 10) / 187.1 million = $11.81 per share
*   **Impact:** A significant increase in the company's valuation.

**2. Data Licensing Agreements**

*   **Formula:** Change in Valuation = (Increase in Other Revenue x P/S Multiple) / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   P/S Multiple: 12x (higher multiple due to higher gross margin of this revenue stream)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 187.1 million
*   **Base Scenario Calculation:**
    *   Increase in Other Revenue: $100 million
    *   Change in Valuation: ($100 million x 12) / 187.1 million = $6.41 per share
*   **Impact:** A meaningful increase in the company's valuation.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

Additionally, the new data licensing revenue stream provides a high-margin opportunity that is not yet fully appreciated by the market.
