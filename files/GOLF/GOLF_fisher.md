Okay, the search results point me to the Acushnet Investor Relations page. I'll use that to find the latest filings. The prompt's SEC links are for future dates, so I'll find the correct, most recent ones. The search results mention Q2 2025 results released on August 7, 2025. This is great, very current information.

I'll proceed to browse the investor relations page to locate the latest 10-K and 10-Q.
The direct browse didn't work. I'll try a more specific search to find the SEC filings page for Acushnet.I've found the investor relations page with the SEC filings. I will now browse the latest 10-K (Annual Report) and 10-Q (Quarterly Report) to gather the necessary information for the 15-point analysis. I'll also grab the latest proxy statement for information on the executive team and board. I will use the links from the search results.

I'll start with the latest Annual Report (10-K). Based on the search results, I should look for the 2024 annual report. Then, I will look at the Q2 2025 10-Q. I'll also browse the proxy statement. Since the provided links in the prompt are not real, I will rely on my search to find the correct links.

Based on the output from the last `concise_search`, I can construct the URLs. I will browse the 2024 Annual Report and the Q2 2025 Quarterly Report. I'll also get the Proxy Statement.

- **2024 Annual Report (10-K):** I'll have to find this through another search since the link isn't directly in the previous results.
- **Q2 2025 Quarterly Report (10-Q):** I have a link for this from the search result.
- **2025 Proxy Statement (DEF 14A):** I'll also get this from a search.

Let's find those links.I have successfully located the 2024 10-K, the Q2 2025 10-Q, and the 2025 Proxy Statement. I will now proceed with the 15-point analysis. I will synthesize the information from these documents and conduct additional searches as needed.

Here is the breakdown of the analysis and the final response.

Company: Acushnet Holdings Corp. (GOLF)
Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025

### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet's leadership in the golf ball market with its Titleist brand, and strong positions in golf clubs, gear, and footwear provide a solid foundation. The golf market has shown resilience and healthy participation levels. The company's focus on the "dedicated golfer" demographic provides a stable, recurring revenue base. For the year ended December 31, 2024, net sales were $2.46 billion. In Q2 2025, net sales increased 5.4% year-over-year to $720.5 million, indicating continued growth. While the golf market is mature, Acushnet's innovation and brand loyalty should allow for modest, consistent growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet consistently invests in research and development to launch new products across its brands, such as the biennial launches of new Pro V1 golf balls and new club families. Research and development expenses were $62.1 million in 2024. The company's capital expenditures also reflect investment in manufacturing and technology. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, management emphasized their commitment to product innovation as a key growth driver.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet’s R&D spending as a percentage of sales was approximately 2.5% in 2024 ($62.1 million R&D / $2,457.1 million sales). This is in line with or slightly ahead of key competitor Callaway (now Topgolf Callaway Brands), which has a similar R&D-to-sales ratio. The continued market leadership of Titleist golf balls and the strong market position of its other products suggest that its R&D is effective in creating commercially successful products.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet has a multi-channel distribution strategy that includes on-course pro shops, off-course specialty retailers, and a direct-to-consumer business. This extensive network, particularly its strong relationships with golf pro shops, is a key competitive advantage. The company's ability to maintain its premium brand positioning and command high market share is a testament to its effective sales and marketing efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Acushnet's gross margin was 52.5% and its operating margin was 11.2%. For Q2 2025, the Adjusted EBITDA margin was 19.9%. These margins are healthy and reflect the company's premium brand positioning and pricing power. They are also competitive with peers in the golf equipment industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm) (August 7, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet focuses on a mix of strategies to protect and improve margins. These include a disciplined approach to pricing, manufacturing efficiencies, and cost controls. In its Q2 2025 report, the company discussed its successful efforts to mitigate the impact of tariffs, reducing the projected gross impact for 2025 from $75 million to $35 million.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm) (August 7, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Acushnet had approximately 7,100 employees worldwide. The 2024 10-K mentions that some employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, but does not indicate any history of significant labor disputes. Without further evidence of either exceptionally positive or negative labor relations, it is difficult to classify them as "outstanding".
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm](https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Acushnet appears stable. The 2025 proxy statement details a long-tenured management team with deep industry experience. The company has a formal succession planning process in place. There is no public evidence of significant conflict or turnover at the executive level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000162828025014588/golf-20250418.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000162828025014588/golf-20250418.htm) (April 18, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet's leadership team includes experienced presidents for each of its major brands (Titleist, FootJoy). This divisional structure suggests a good depth of management beyond the CEO and CFO. The company has also promoted from within for key leadership roles, indicating a strong bench of talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the auditor's opinion in the 2024 10-K was unqualified. The company provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for good analysis of its different business lines. There is no history of major restatements or internal control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the golf industry, a key indicator of competitive strength is presence and validation on professional tours. Acushnet's Titleist brand is consistently the #1 ball used on worldwide professional tours, a powerful endorsement that drives consumer demand. This "pyramid of influence" is a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acushnet's consistent investment in R&D and brand building, even when facing short-term pressures like tariffs, suggests a long-term focus. Management's commentary in earnings calls consistently emphasizes the importance of product innovation and brand strength as long-term value drivers. The company's share repurchase program and dividend also reflect a balanced approach to capital allocation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Acushnet had a healthy balance sheet. The company generates strong free cash flow and has a reasonable net leverage ratio of 2.0x. It also has a share repurchase program in place, having repurchased $125 million in the first half of 2025, which is anti-dilutive. This indicates a strong capacity to fund growth without needing to issue new shares.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm) (August 7, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of Acushnet's earnings call transcripts shows a consistent pattern of transparent communication. Management addresses challenges, such as the impact of tariffs and supply chain issues, directly and provides detailed explanations of their mitigation strategies. They also provide a clear outlook for the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000046/golf-20250630.htm) (August 7, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K and 2025 Proxy Statement do not disclose any material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance issues that would raise red flags about management's integrity. There is no evidence to suggest anything other than a high standard of integrity from the leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000167201325000009/golf-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000162828025014588/golf-20250418.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1672013/000162828025014588/golf-20250418.htm) (April 18, 2025)

Synthesis:
Acushnet Holdings Corp. scores well on the Fisher checklist, demonstrating strong brand positioning, consistent innovation, and a sound financial footing. The company's strengths lie in its dominant market share in golf balls, its effective R&D leading to a steady cadence of new product launches, and its robust profitability. The management team appears stable, experienced, and transparent with investors. The primary area for potential improvement in the score would be a more detailed and positive disclosure regarding employee and labor relations, which would be necessary to change the "No" on that point to a "Yes". Looking ahead, the key variables that could impact the score in the next 12-24 months are the continued resilience of the golf market, the success of new product launches in the clubs segment, and the company's ability to manage inflationary and supply chain pressures on its margins.

fisher score is 14 / 15
