### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation**

This section reverse-engineers the current market price to determine the growth and profitability assumptions embedded within it. This analysis remains unchanged from the original to serve as our baseline for what the market is pricing in.

**A) Current Market Price & Baseline Financials**

*   **Current Market Price:** $6.36 (as of close, August 22, 2025).

The following Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) financials for the period ending June 30, 2025, are used.

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,031 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 70.5% | (Calculation: $726.35M / $1,031M) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $223.5 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| *Operating Margin* | *21.7%* | *(Calculation: $223.5M / $1,031M)* |
| Net Income | ($849.3) | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $46.2 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $34.1 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures | ($10.7) | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($42.1) | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | ($52.3) | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $261.7 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $627.0 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Diluted W.A. Shares | 109.2 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |

**B) Market-Implied Assumptions**

*   **Market Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   Market Capitalization = $6.36/share \* 109.2M shares = $694.5M
    *   Net Debt = $627.0M (Total Debt) - $261.7M (Cash) = $365.3M
    *   **Market EV = $1,059.8M**

*   **Discount Rate (WACC) Calculation:**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 22, 2025).
    *   Beta: **1.97**. This high beta reflects significant historical volatility.
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard assumption for a mature market).
    *   Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.26% + 1.97 \* 5.0% = **14.11%**
    *   Cost of Debt (Kd) = $52.3M / $627.0M = 8.34%. Using a normalized 21% tax rate.
    *   WACC = (694.5/1059.8) \* 14.11% + (365.3/1059.8) \* 8.34% \* (1 - 0.21) = **11.53%**

*   **Market-Implied Growth Rate:**
    Holding the TTM EBIT margin of 21.7% and other financial ratios constant, a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.5%** is required to justify the current enterprise value of $1,059.8M.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify its current stock price of $6.36, an investor must believe Bumble can grow its revenue at a **9.5% CAGR** for the next five years while maintaining its current **21.7% EBIT margin**. This represents a significant turnaround from recent performance.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section presents an independent valuation with refined assumptions to better reflect a realistic, forward-looking view of the company.

**C) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base-Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | 4% tapering to 3% | The market-implied 9.5% is highly optimistic. The original's 5% is a good start, but a slightly more conservative 4% in Year 1 reflects near-term competitive headwinds and user fatigue, followed by a gradual stabilization to the long-term economic growth rate. This assumes a successful but not spectacular revitalization of the core app. |
| **Operating Margin** | 21.0% | The original's 20% margin was prudently conservative. We revise this to 21.0%, slightly below the TTM 21.7%, assuming management successfully executes on stated efficiency goals and cost controls, balancing marketing spend with profitability. |
| **Tax Rate** | 21.0% | Unchanged. The standard U.S. corporate tax rate is the most stable and realistic long-term assumption. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 1.1% | TTM Capex is 1.04% of TTM revenue. A 1.1% assumption is in line with recent history and the company's asset-light model. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 3.3% | Unchanged. The TTM Stock-Based Compensation of 3.3% of revenue is a reasonable baseline. |
| **Change in WC** | 4.0% of Revenue Change | Unchanged. Using the TTM figure of 4.0% remains a sound assumption for modeling cash needs related to growth. |
| **Share Count Change** | 0% net change annually | Unchanged. A net zero change is a conservative and appropriate assumption without a major announced buyback program. |

**D) Revised Discount Rate (WACC)**

The WACC of 11.53% used in Part 1 is based on a historical beta of 1.97, which reflects a period of extreme stock price volatility and may not be representative of future risk. A forward-looking beta that assumes some normalization is more appropriate for a long-term valuation.

*   **Revised Beta:** **1.40**. This is a more realistic forward-looking beta for a company in the online media sector. It is lower than the extreme historical figure but still well above the market average of 1.0, acknowledging inherent sector volatility and company-specific risks. Competitor Match Group (MTCH) has historically exhibited a beta in this range.
*   **Revised Cost of Equity (Ke)** = 4.26% + 1.40 \* 5.0% = **11.26%**
*   **Revised WACC** = (694.5/1059.8) \* 11.26% + (365.3/1059.8) \* 8.34% \* (1 - 0.21) = 7.39% + 2.27% = **9.66%**

This lower WACC more appropriately reflects the fundamental long-term risk of the business rather than short-term stock market sentiment.

**E) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in WC

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,072.2 | $1,111.4 | $1,148.4 | $1,186.6 | $1,222.2 |
| EBIT (21.0% margin) | $225.2 | $233.4 | $241.2 | $249.2 | $256.7 |
| EBIAT (taxed at 21%) | $177.9 | $184.4 | $190.5 | $196.8 | $202.8 |
| \+ D&A (4.5% of Rev) | $48.2 | $50.0 | $51.7 | $53.4 | $55.0 |
| \- SBC (3.3% of Rev) | ($35.4) | ($36.7) | ($37.9) | ($39.2) | ($40.3) |
| \- Capex (1.1% of Rev) | ($11.8) | ($12.2) | ($12.6) | ($13.1) | ($13.4) |
| \- Chg. in WC | ($1.6) | ($1.7) | ($1.5) | ($1.5) | ($1.4) |
| **FCFF** | **$177.3** | **$183.8** | **$190.2** | **$196.4** | **$202.7** |
| PV of FCFF (@9.66%) | $161.7 | $152.7 | $144.1 | $136.0 | $128.2 |

**F) Terminal Value**

The Gordon Growth method is highly sensitive to WACC and growth rate assumptions. A more robust, market-based approach is to use an Exit Multiple.

*   **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT ($256.7M) + D&A ($55.0M) = **$311.7M**
    *   Exit Multiple: **9.0x EV/EBITDA**. This is a realistic multiple for a moderately growing, established consumer internet company. It sits between lower-growth legacy media companies and higher-growth tech leaders. It is more realistic than the 7.25x implied by the original model.
    *   Terminal Value = $311.7M \* 9.0 = **$2,805.3M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $2,805.3M / (1 + 9.66%)^5 = **$1,770.8M**

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF ($161.7+$152.7+$144.1+$136.0+$128.2) = $722.7M
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $1,770.8M
    *   **Analyst's EV = $2,493.5M**

*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = EV - Net Debt
    *   Equity Value = $2,493.5M - $365.3M = **$2,128.2M**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Per-Share Value = $2,128.2M / 109.2M shares = **$19.49**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $19.49.** Assumes a moderate recovery, sustained margins, and a realistic exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $12.50.** Assumes flat growth, margin compression to 18%, and a lower 7.5x exit multiple due to competitive losses.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $27.50.** Assumes a successful turnaround drives 6% growth, margin expansion to 23%, and a higher 10.0x exit multiple.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety below the base-case estimate provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   MOS Price = $19.49 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$13.64**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competitive Pressure:** Bumble operates in a highly competitive market dominated by Match Group (Tinder, Hinge). Failure to innovate and retain users could lead to market share loss.
2.  **User Churn and Acquisition Costs:** The online dating market has low switching costs. Bumble's success depends on its ability to attract and retain paying users at a reasonable cost, which has been a challenge recently.
3.  **Brand and Execution Risk:** The company's value is tied to its brand perception. Any missteps in product strategy, marketing, or public relations could damage user trust and engagement.
4.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** App store fee policies (from Apple and Google) and evolving data privacy regulations could negatively impact revenue and operating models.

final answer is 19.49 $
