**Synthesis:**
Delta Air Lines scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its primary strengths being its strong market position, commitment to innovation, and shareholder-friendly financial management. The company's focus on premium products and operational efficiency drives strong profit margins. The only notable area of concern is labor relations, which could pose a risk to the company's long-term stability. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the successful execution of its fleet modernization plan, the continued growth of its loyalty program, and its ability to manage labor relations effectively. A successful resolution of outstanding labor contracts could flip the "No" on point 7 to a "Yes."

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
