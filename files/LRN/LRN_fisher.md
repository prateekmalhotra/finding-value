**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's R&D spending is not explicitly broken out in its financial statements, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the company's filings do discuss investments in curriculum development and technology platforms. The lack of specific R&D metrics makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of these investments. Without clear data on R&D productivity, a definitive "Yes" is not supported.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837025010334/lrn-20250630x10k.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's sales and marketing efforts are primarily focused on student enrollment and client acquisition for its institutional and enterprise offerings. The company's enrollment figures, as reported in its quarterly filings, are a key indicator of its sales effectiveness. The 2025 10-K shows steady enrollment growth in the career learning segment, suggesting an effective sales strategy in that area. However, without more detailed metrics on sales productivity or win rates, it's difficult to definitively say the organization is "above-average."
**Answer:** No

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no significant evidence of major labor disputes or widespread employee dissatisfaction from the reviewed sources. The company's 10-K does not mention any significant labor-related issues. However, without more specific disclosures on employee turnover, engagement scores, or other metrics, it is difficult to definitively assess the quality of personnel relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837025010334/lrn-20250630x10k.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's 10-K and other filings name a number of executive officers beyond the CEO, suggesting a degree of management depth. The company has also promoted from within for key leadership roles, which can be a sign of a strong talent pipeline. However, the lack of a formal succession plan disclosure prevents a confident "Yes" on this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837025010334/lrn-20250630x10k.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's 10-K includes a statement on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting, which is standard practice. The company's auditor has not issued an adverse opinion on its financial statements. The financial reporting appears to be detailed and transparent, with segment-level data provided. There is no evidence of major accounting issues or restatements in the reviewed filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837025010334/lrn-20250630x10k.htm']

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the online education industry, key competitive advantages include the quality of the curriculum, the effectiveness of the technology platform, and relationships with school districts and other partners. Stride has been in the online education business for a long time and has developed a strong brand and a broad network of partner schools.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in earnings calls and investor presentations consistently emphasizes long-term growth opportunities, particularly in the career learning segment. The company has been willing to make investments in new programs and technologies that may not have an immediate payoff but are expected to drive future growth. This willingness to invest for the long term is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride has a solid balance sheet with a healthy cash position and manageable debt levels.

Synthesis:
Stride, Inc. appears to be a solid company with a strong position in the growing online education market. The company's focus on the high-growth career learning segment is a key positive, and its financial position is sound. The main areas of weakness in this analysis are the lack of clear data on R&D effectiveness and management depth. A clearer articulation of the company's R&D strategy and outcomes, as well as a more formal succession plan, would help to improve the score. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to continue to grow its career learning segment and maintain its profit margins.

fisher score is 11 / 15
