Of course. I have reviewed the provided valuation. While the structure and thought process are clear, there are several significant issues, primarily in the calculation of Free Cash Flow and the Discount Rate, which lead to an overly pessimistic and likely incorrect conclusion.

The provided analysis correctly identifies the key value drivers for Snap: revenue growth, margin expansion, and the significant impact of Stock-Based Compensation (SBC). However, the mechanical application of the formulas contains critical flaws.

Below is a revised valuation that corrects these issues, uses more realistic assumptions for a base-case scenario, and provides a more plausible intrinsic value. The format and all original data points have been preserved and integrated into the corrected analysis.

### PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** To begin, I will fetch the latest market price for SNAP.The current market price for Snap Inc. (SNAP) is **$7.20** (Investing.com, August 22, 2025).

2.  **Baseline Financials (LTM):** I will now gather the Last Twelve Months (LTM) financial data.

| Financial Metric | LTM (in millions USD) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,638 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 53.82% | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | -$654 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Net Income | -$546 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $153 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $1,017 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | -$194 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | -$1 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | -$63 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $926 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $4,192 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 1,679 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the market's implied assumptions, we must find a plausible combination of revenue growth and operating margin that justifies the current Enterprise Value.

*   **Market Capitalization:** $7.20/share * 1,679 million shares = $12,089 million (Market Price, Aug 22, 2025; StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025)
*   **Net Debt:** $4,192 million (Total Debt) - $926 million (Cash) = $3,266 million (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 23, 2025)
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $12,089 million + $3,266 million = $15,355 million

A reverse DCF model requires iterating on growth and margin. Holding the LTM operating margin of -11.6% constant is not feasible as it would never generate positive cash flows. Therefore, the market must be pricing in both significant revenue growth *and* a substantial margin expansion.

After iterating, a plausible scenario the market is pricing in is:
*   **5-Year Revenue Growth CAGR:** Approximately **20%**. This would grow revenue from $5.6B to ~$13.9B in Year 5.
*   **Year 5 Operating Margin:** Approximately **15%**. This implies a significant ramp-up from the current -11.6% margin.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the current stock price of $7.20, an investor must believe that Snap can grow its revenue at a 20% compound annual rate for the next five years while simultaneously expanding its operating margin to a profitable 15% by the end of that period. This is a helpful baseline for what the market believes.

### PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** The market's implied assumptions appear optimistic. This base case will use assumptions that are more balanced—less aggressive than the market's view but less punitive than the original conservative case—reflecting a realistic path to sustained profitability.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:**
    *   **Justification:** Snap's LTM growth was 13.18%. The digital ad market remains competitive, but Snap's user engagement is strong. A tapering growth rate that starts above the recent trend and gradually slows is a reasonable assumption.
    *   **Assumption:** Revenue growth will be **15%** in Year 1, tapering down to **7%** by Year 5. (This assumption is reasonable and will be retained).

8.  **Margin Path:**
    *   **Justification:** A rapid expansion to 15% is speculative, but a slow crawl to 8% may be too conservative if the company achieves scale. I will assume a steady path to a respectable, but not best-in-class, operating margin.
    *   **Assumption:** Operating margin improves from **-5%** in Year 1 to **+12%** in Year 5, a slightly more optimistic path reflecting successful cost management and operating leverage.

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Justification:** Snap will likely use its substantial Net Operating Losses (NOLs) to shield from cash taxes in the near term as it becomes profitable.
    *   **Assumption:** A **0%** cash tax rate for the 5-year forecast period, transitioning to the U.S. statutory rate of **21%** for the terminal value calculation. (Retained).

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** The LTM capex was 3.4% of revenue. This is a reasonable proxy for maintenance and growth capex.
    *   **Assumption:** Capex will remain at **3.5% of revenue** annually. (Retained).
    *   **Working Capital:** A small investment in working capital is needed to support growth.
    *   **Assumption:** Change in Non-Cash Working Capital will be **1.0% of incremental revenue**. (Retained).

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **Justification:** SBC is a real cost to shareholders via dilution. The model must account for it.
    *   **Assumption (SBC):** SBC will decline as a percentage of revenue as the company matures, starting at **17%** of revenue in Year 1 and tapering to **12%** by Year 5. (Retained).
    *   **Assumption (Shares):** No significant buybacks. The diluted share count will increase. A net **1.5% annual increase** is a reasonable proxy for the dilutive effect of SBC. (Retained).

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Formula Correction:** The previous formula incorrectly subtracted SBC, which is a non-cash expense, from a post-tax EBIT figure where it had already been deducted. This double-counted the expense and created artificially negative cash flows.
    *   **Correct Standard Formula:** **FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital.**
    *   *SBC is accounted for through its impact on the final diluted share count, not as a direct cash outflow in the FCFF calculation.*

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**

| Year | 1 (2026E) | 2 (2027E) | 3 (2028E) | 4 (2029E) | 5 (2030E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,484 | $7,321 | $8,126 | $8,858 | $9,478 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *15.0%* | *13.0%* | *11.0%* | *9.0%* | *7.0%* |
| EBIT | -$324 | $73 | $488 | $886 | $1,137 |
| *Operating Margin* | *-5.0%* | *1.0%* | *6.0%* | *10.0%* | *12.0%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-Tax)) | -$324 | $73 | $488 | $886 | $1,137 |
| D&A | $162 | $183 | $203 | $221 | $237 |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | -$227 | -$256 | -$284 | -$310 | -$332 |
| Change in Work. Cap. | -$8 | -$7 | -$7 | -$7 | -$6 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **-$397** | **-$7** | **$401** | **$790** | **$1,036** |

13. **FCFF Rationale:** FCFF is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers. The corrected formula now shows a realistic path to positive cash flow by Year 3 as margins expand.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%.
    *   **Beta:** 1.40 (Yahoo Finance, 5-Year Monthly).
    *   **Cost of Equity:** 4.25% + 1.40 * (5.0%) = **11.25%** (Retained).

15. **Cost of Debt (Revised):**
    *   **Justification:** The effective rate of 1.5% on existing debt does not reflect the current borrowing cost for a company with Snap's risk profile. A more realistic marginal cost of debt is based on the company's credit rating or yields on its publicly traded debt.
    *   **Assumption:** The pre-tax cost of debt for Snap to issue new debt is **5.5%**.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt:** 5.5% * (1 - 0.21) = **4.35%**. *Note: The long-term marginal tax rate is used in the WACC as it reflects a permanent state of the company.*

16. **WACC (Revised):**
    *   **Market Value of Equity:** $12,089 million
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $4,192 million
    *   **WACC Formula:** (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   **Calculation:** ($12,089/$16,281) * 11.25% + ($4,192/$16,281) * 5.5% * (1-0.21) = 74.3% * 11.25% + 25.7% * 4.35% = 8.36% + 1.12% = **9.48%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Gordon Growth Method (Now Viable):**
    *   **Justification:** With a corrected FCFF calculation, the company is projected to be sustainably cash-flow positive, making the Gordon Growth Model (GGM) the most appropriate method as it is based on the company's intrinsic ability to generate cash.
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This reflects long-term nominal GDP and inflation growth. (Retained).
    *   **FCFF in Terminal Year (normalized):** We must use a normalized free cash flow for the terminal value calculation.
        *   Terminal Year NOPAT: $1,137M (Year 5 EBIT) * (1 - 0.21) = $898M
        *   Reinvestment: We need to estimate the portion of NOPAT reinvested to achieve the 2.5% growth.
            *   Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) Assumption: Let's assume a mature ROIC of 12.5%, reasonable for a software/ad-tech company.
            *   Reinvestment Rate = g / ROIC = 2.5% / 12.5% = 20.0%
        *   Normalized Terminal FCFF = Terminal NOPAT * (1 - Reinvestment Rate) = $898M * (1 - 0.20) = **$718M**
    *   **Terminal Value Calculation:** (Terminal FCFF * (1+g)) / (WACC - g) = ($718M * 1.025) / (9.48% - 2.5%) = $736M / 6.98% = **$10,544 million**

18. **Exit Multiple Method (Cross-Check):**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** Year 5 EBIT ($1,137M) + Year 5 D&A ($237M) = $1,374M.
    *   **Multiple:** A **14.0x EV/EBITDA** multiple is realistic for a company with high-single-digit growth and ~12% margins in the social media space.
    *   **Terminal Value:** $1,374 million * 14.0 = **$19,236 million**. This higher value suggests our GGM-based terminal value is not overly aggressive. We will proceed with the more fundamentally-grounded GGM result.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** (-$397 / 1.0948^1) + (-$7 / 1.0948^2) + ($401 / 1.0948^3) + ($790 / 1.0948^4) + ($1,036 / 1.0948^5) = -$363 - $6 + $306 + $550 + $660 = **$1,147 million**
    *   **PV of Terminal Value:** $10,544 million / (1.0948^5) = **$6,719 million**
    *   **Enterprise Value:** $1,147 million + $6,719 million = **$7,866 million**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value Formula:** Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   **Calculation:** $7,866 million - $3,266 million = **$4,600 million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Future Diluted Shares:** To account for dilution from SBC over 5 years, we project the share count: 1,679 million * (1.015)^5 = **1,808 million shares**.
    *   **Value Per Share:** $4,600 million / 1,808 million shares = **$2.54**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$2.54**. This reflects the realistic path to profitability and accounts for flaws in the original model.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Slower growth (e.g., 10% tapering to 4%) and a slower margin ramp to 8% in Year 5 could result in a fair value closer to **$0.50 per share**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Faster growth (e.g., 20% tapering to 10%) and margin expansion to 18% in Year 5, alongside a higher exit multiple, could yield a fair value of approximately **$8.00 per share**.

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a standard 30% Margin of Safety to our base-case fair value provides a potential "buy" price.
    *   **MOS Price:** $2.54 * (1 - 0.30) = **$1.78**. This suggests that at the current price of $7.20, the stock remains significantly overvalued even under this revised, more favorable model.

**Risk Notes**
1.  **Path to Profitability:** The valuation remains extremely sensitive to the operating margin assumption. Failure to execute on cost controls and leverage scale would severely impair value.
2.  **Stock-Based Compensation:** While now correctly modeled via dilution, SBC remains a major hurdle. If it does not decline as a percentage of revenue, the dilutive effect will be greater than projected, reducing per-share value.
3.  **Competitive Environment:** Intense competition from Meta, Google, and TikTok remains the largest external threat to Snap's ability to achieve the revenue growth and margin expansion required to justify even this revised valuation.

final answer is 2.54 $
