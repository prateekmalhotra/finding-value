PENN Entertainment, Inc. Analysis Date: August 24, 2025. Primary Sources Reviewed: 2023 10-K filed February 22, 2024, and Q1 2025 Earnings Release dated May 8, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PENN Entertainment operates in two primary markets: retail casinos and online sports betting/iGaming. While the retail casino market is mature, the online sports betting and iGaming sector in North America is still in a high-growth phase as more jurisdictions legalize these activities. The company's strategic alliance with ESPN to launch ESPN BET on November 14, 2023, is a pivotal move to capture a significant share of this expanding online market. PENN operates online sports betting in 18 jurisdictions and iCasino in five jurisdictions, with plans to enter additional states as they become legal. The success of this online segment, leveraged by the powerful ESPN brand, represents the most significant potential for a sizable increase in sales over the next several years.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to developing its high-growth Interactive segment. The company acquired Score Media and Gaming, Inc. in October 2021 to gain control of its own technology stack, including a proprietary player account management system and risk/trading platform. This was followed by the transformative agreement with ESPN in August 2023, rebranding its online sportsbook to ESPN BET. In the Q1 2025 earnings release, CEO Jay Snowden highlighted ongoing product enhancements for ESPN BET, including adding ESPN favorites and a new rewards program, and expanding their standalone Hollywood iCasino app into new states. This focus on owning the technology and partnering with a premier media brand shows a clear determination to innovate beyond the mature retail casino business.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PENN does not disclose specific R&D expenditures in its financial statements, which is common for the industry. However, its "R&D" can be viewed as its investment in its Interactive division's technology. The acquisition of theScore for its technology platform and the subsequent launch of the revamped ESPN BET app demonstrate a significant investment. In Q1 2025, the Interactive segment generated record gaming revenue, indicating the technology is performing and gaining user adoption. The effectiveness must be measured by market share gains and profitability over time, which is not yet established. The heavy investment has led to significant losses in the Interactive segment, making a definitive "Yes" premature.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In this industry, "sales" is equivalent to marketing and customer acquisition. PENN's key strategy is its exclusive, long-term alliance with ESPN, giving it access to a massive and engaged audience of sports fans. The ESPN BET brand is deeply integrated within ESPN's content and programming ecosystem. This provides a highly efficient customer acquisition funnel compared to competitors who rely more heavily on traditional advertising. The company also leverages its PENN PlayTM loyalty program, with over 29 million members, to cross-sell its retail casino customers into its online products. This unique combination of a powerful media partnership and a large retail database constitutes an above-average sales and marketing apparatus.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PENN's profit margins are currently challenged by the significant investment in its Interactive segment. For the full year 2023, the company reported a consolidated net loss of $491.4 million and an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 14.5%. This is a decline from 28.0% in 2022. The regional retail casino segments (Northeast, South, West, Midwest) individually have strong Adjusted EBITDAR margins, ranging from 30.3% to 42.4% in 2023. However, the Interactive segment had an Adjusted EBITDAR margin of -56.0% in 2023 and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $89.0 million in Q1 2025. Until the Interactive segment approaches profitability, the consolidated profit margin is not worthwhile.
**Answer:** No

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The primary action to improve consolidated margins is achieving profitability in the Interactive segment. Management is focused on disciplined marketing and promotional activity for ESPN BET to ensure a favorable return on investment. Owning their own technology stack is also a key long-term margin driver, as it reduces reliance on costly third-party vendors. In the retail segment, the company focuses on operational efficiencies and leveraging its PENN PlayTM loyalty program to drive profitable revenue streams from its most valuable customers. The Q1 2025 results showed a significant year-over-year improvement in the Interactive segment's Adjusted EBITDA loss, from -$196.0 million to -$89.0 million, demonstrating progress toward this goal.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2023, PENN had approximately 23,333 employees, with roughly 4,180 (about 18%) covered by 35 collective bargaining agreements. The company's 10-K states, "we believe that we have good employee relations." However, twelve of these agreements were scheduled to expire in 2024, creating negotiation risk. While there are no widespread reports of major labor disputes, the presence of union contracts and ongoing negotiations prevent a clear "outstanding" assessment without more specific positive evidence of employee satisfaction or industry-leading benefits.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH44hASK40EhP-K6_OIV8LBy0ETerTSeU9QolcLLaDd9bZ8kQ1-thPQexMHIM67mu1kfVGA_kJnH10rWlNWa33u4PixxPIq_vq8LeBtlEb9PB4P23mFhtwwWMyZg6aaEwxHHyNvW38V7VOZSCe-iJFIV3PoMmZCDwQOmeZpRzXuBFBElVNNxRBasD4VWauMClpQgw==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH44hASK40EhP-K6_OIV8LBy0ETerTSeU9QolcLLaDd9bZ8kQ1-thPQexMHIM67mu1kfVGA_kJnH10rWlNWa33u4PixxPIq_vq8LeBtlEb9PB4P23mFhtwwWMyZg6aaEwxHHyNvW38V7VOZSCe-iJFIV3PoMmZCDwQOmeZpRzXuBFBElVNNxRBasD4VWauMClpQgw==) (February 22, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, led by CEO Jay Snowden, has been stable and has guided the company through a significant strategic transformation, moving from the Barstool partnership to the ESPN alliance. This pivot, while costly, demonstrates a board and executive team aligned on a long-term vision. Information regarding incentive alignment and insider ownership would typically be found in the company's definitive proxy statement (DEF 14A), which was not reviewed. Without that document, a full assessment is difficult, but the consistent strategic messaging from the CEO across earnings calls suggests a stable and functioning executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG5CHDr7KzAC3W_kYC4i1RlVNsd3n-nAan1hhNrnjaas1HoQO8s_jp5srvlq-rAbSMcPPU1KngK5R9SIlMTcwkBX_du3zzpDaM6N6H5hyfk7malluEJV8GT9EGjo8TKdqxqkilRuKyjb7FLIs119Cz7f7Pcwx5QtaU62T641A1dsiy_n6wyeazsH6Er3XdRUQ5_jWinxXsIjeQw6-uAvbyECCKd60NaxjrpWlg2Kf6z9i4jT528o-6dTGc=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG5CHDr7KzAC3W_kYC4i1RlVNsd3n-nAan1hhNrnjaas1HoQO8s_jp5srvlq-rAbSMcPPU1KngK5R9SIlMTcwkBX_du3zzpDaM6N6H5hyfk7malluEJV8GT9EGjo8TKdqxqkilRuKyjb7FLIs119Cz7f7Pcwx5QtaU62T641A1dsiy_n6wyeazsH6Er3XdRUQ5_jWinxXsIjeQw6-uAvbyECCKd60NaxjrpWlg2Kf6z9i4jT528o-6dTGc=) (May 8, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PENN's corporate leadership team, as detailed on its investor relations website and in filings, includes experienced executives overseeing key areas like operations, finance, legal, and the Interactive division. The company is organized into five reportable segments, four of which are geographic retail operations and one is the Interactive division, each presumably with dedicated leadership. However, public documents do not provide extensive detail on the management bench beyond the named executive officers, nor is there explicit disclosure on succession planning. Given the complexity of operating 43 properties and a high-growth digital business, the existing structure implies depth, but it is not explicitly documented.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PENN provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down its business geographically and by its Interactive division, which allows for analysis of performance drivers. The company’s 2023 10-K filing includes an unqualified opinion from its independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, on both the financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023. There is no mention of material weaknesses or a history of significant restatements. This indicates that the company has good and reliable accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH44hASK40EhP-K6_OIV8LBy0ETerTSeU9QolcLLaDd9bZ8kQ1-thPQexMHIM67mu1kfVGA_kJnH10rWlNWa33u4PixxPIq_vq8LeBtlEb9PB4P23mFhtwwWMyZg6aaEwxHHyNvW38V7VOZSCe-iJFIV3PoMmZCDwQOmeZpRzXuBFBElVNNxRBasD4VWauMClpQgw==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH44hASK40EhP-K6_OIV8LBy0ETerTSeU9QolcLLaDd9bZ8kQ1-thPQexMHIM67mu1kfVGA_kJnH10rWlNWa33u4PixxPIq_vq8LeBtlEb9PB4P23mFhtwwWMyZg6aaEwxHHyNvW38V7VOZSCe-iJFIV3PoMmZCDwQOmeZpRzXuBFBElVNNxRBasD4VWauMClpQgw==) (February 22, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PENN's most significant and peculiar competitive advantage is its "omnichannel" strategy, amplified by the ESPN partnership. The strategy is to leverage its large database of retail casino customers (over 29 million PENN PlayTM members) and cross-sell them to its digital products, ESPN BET and Hollywood iCasino. This integration of a massive retail footprint with the largest sports media brand in the U.S. is a unique approach not replicated by competitors, who are either purely digital (like DraftKings) or have a different, less integrated retail presence. The success of this synergy, converting retail players to online and vice-versa, will be the key clue to its long-term competitive standing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, management's actions clearly prioritize long-range growth over short-term profits. The entire strategy for the Interactive segment, culminating in the ESPN BET launch, involves absorbing significant near-term losses to build market share and a sustainable, profitable business for the long term. The Interactive segment's Adjusted EBITDAR was a loss of $402.5 million in 2023 and an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $89.0 million in Q1 2025. Management consistently communicates this strategy to investors, framing the current spending as a necessary investment to compete in the nascent and rapidly growing North American online gaming market.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position appears strong enough to avoid dilutive equity financing. As of March 31, 2025, PENN had total liquidity of $1.5 billion, including $591.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company is actively repurchasing shares, not issuing them; through May 7, 2025, it had repurchased $35 million of shares with a stated goal of at least $350 million for the year. While the ESPN agreement does include warrants issued to ESPN, this is part of a strategic partnership rather than a broad public equity offering for cash. The company's cash flow from its retail operations helps fund the investment in the Interactive segment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management, particularly CEO Jay Snowden, appears to be candid with investors. In the Q1 2025 earnings release, he directly addressed headwinds, noting the negative impact of "severe weather challenges" on the retail business and "industry-wide unfavorable sports betting hold" on the Interactive segment. He also acknowledged that corporate overhead costs were higher than expected due to legal and advisory fees. This willingness to openly discuss challenges and specific negative financial impacts, rather than focusing only on positives, is a strong indicator of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates in a highly regulated industry and maintains gaming licenses in 20 states, which requires a high standard of integrity and compliance. There are no significant disclosures of material legal or regulatory actions against the company or its executives for issues related to integrity in the reviewed 10-K. The auditor's report is clean, and the company has processes for cybersecurity and risk management. While the previous partnership with Barstool Sports involved a controversial brand, the company successfully navigated that relationship and pivoted to a blue-chip partner in ESPN, suggesting management acts in what it believes to be the company's best interest.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
PENN Entertainment's Fisher score reflects a company in the midst of a significant, costly, but strategically sound transformation. The company's strongest positive attributes are its long-range outlook, its unique omnichannel sales strategy via the ESPN partnership and retail database, and management's candor and integrity. The primary negatives are all related to the financial impact of this transformation: poor current profit margins and unproven effectiveness of its massive R&D/technology investment in the Interactive segment. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on the performance of the Interactive segment. Specifically, a clear and sustained trend towards profitability in the ESPN BET/Hollywood Casino business would flip the "No" on profit margins and R&D effectiveness to "Yes." Evidence for this would be sequential improvement in Interactive segment Adjusted EBITDA and achieving a top-three market share in online sports betting in key states.

fisher score is 11 / 15
