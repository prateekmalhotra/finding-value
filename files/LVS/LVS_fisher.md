**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Las Vegas Sands operates in the Macao and Singapore markets, both of which have significant long-term growth potential. The company's Macao properties are positioned to benefit from the continued growth of the Greater Bay Area and the recovery of international tourism. In Singapore, Marina Bay Sands is a landmark destination with a strong MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, and Exhibitions) business and tourism appeal. The company is also investing heavily in new projects, including a $2 billion expansion of Marina Bay Sands, which will add a new hotel tower, an entertainment arena, and additional MICE space.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** LVS has a clear commitment to reinvesting in its properties and pursuing new growth opportunities. The company has announced a multi-billion dollar capital investment program for its Macao and Singapore properties.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has historically generated high profit margins, driven by its focus on the high-margin gaming and retail segments.

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on several initiatives to maintain and improve profit margins.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** LVS's key competitive advantage is its focus on the MICE segment. The company's large-scale integrated resorts are designed to attract a mix of leisure and business travelers, which provides a more diversified and stable revenue stream compared to competitors that are more reliant on gaming revenue. This focus also allows the company to generate significant non-gaming revenue from hotel rooms, retail, and food and beverage. The company's strong relationships with governments in its operating markets also provide a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has consistently demonstrated a long-range outlook, prioritizing long-term growth over short-term profits. The company's significant investments in its properties, even during periods of economic uncertainty, are a testament to this. In recent earnings calls, management has emphasized its commitment to a multi-year capital investment program aimed at driving long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Las Vegas Sands has a strong balance sheet and a healthy cash flow generation capacity. As of its latest quarterly report, the company has a significant cash and cash equivalents balance. The company has a manageable debt level and has access to a revolving credit facility. This provides the financial flexibility to fund its capital expenditure plans without resorting to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1300514/000130051425000095/lvs-20250331.htm']

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a good track record of communicating with investors in a transparent and candid manner. During the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a significant impact on the company's operations, management provided regular updates and a clear outlook on the challenges and recovery prospects. Earnings calls are detailed, and management is generally forthcoming in addressing analysts' questions.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis
Las Vegas Sands scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth prospects, commitment to development, and financial strength. The company's focus on the MICE segment and its strong position in the attractive Macao and Singapore markets are key competitive advantages. The main areas of concern are the lack of traditional R&D (which is not directly applicable to the industry), the absence of clear evidence of outstanding labor relations, and a history of legal and regulatory issues that prevent a "Yes" on unquestionable integrity. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company can demonstrate a sustained period of positive labor relations and avoid any further regulatory scrutiny. A "No" on R&D is unlikely to change given the nature of the business, but a clearer articulation of its innovation strategy in guest experience and operational efficiency could strengthen its case.

fisher score is 12 / 15
