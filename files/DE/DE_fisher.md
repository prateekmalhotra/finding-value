Deere & Company, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K, 10-Q), Earnings Call Transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere is capitalizing on global trends of population growth and increased protein consumption, which drive demand for agricultural productivity. The company is also expanding its addressable market through precision agriculture technologies, which are still in the early stages of adoption. For example, the company has set a goal for 90% of new small ag equipment to be connected by 2026, indicating a significant runway for growth in this area. The company's 2024 10-K notes that the long-term trend for demand for agricultural and construction equipment is favorable.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere has a stated goal of delivering $150 billion in incremental total addressable market by 2030, driven by new products and business models. The company's R&D expenses were $2.169 billion in fiscal 2024, a significant investment in future growth. Deere is also actively acquiring companies to enhance its technology offerings, such as the 2021 acquisition of Bear Flag Robotics for autonomous tractor technology.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://investor.deere.com/events-and-presentations/presentations/2024/default.aspx', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm', 'https://www.reuters.com/technology/deere-buy-bear-flag-robotics-250-mln-2021-08-05/']

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's R&D expense as a percentage of net sales was approximately 4.5% in 2024. This is a significant investment, and it has yielded tangible results in the form of a growing portfolio of precision agriculture technologies. While direct comparisons of R&D effectiveness are difficult, Deere's leadership in this area is widely acknowledged. The company's focus on "sense and act" technology, which enables machines to make decisions in real time, is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere has a global network of over 2,000 independent dealer locations, which provides a significant competitive advantage in terms of sales and service. The company has been working to optimize its dealer channel, aiming to have fewer, larger, and more effective dealers. The strength of this dealer network is a key reason for the company's strong market share in key regions.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the second quarter of 2025, Deere reported a gross profit margin of 39.4% for its equipment operations. For fiscal year 2024, the company's operating margin was 21.9%. These margins are strong for a manufacturing company and reflect the company's pricing power and cost control.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere is focused on "value creation," which includes a disciplined approach to pricing and a focus on higher-margin products and services. The company is also investing in operational efficiency, including automation and robotics in its factories. In its Q2 2025 earnings call, the company noted that price realization was a positive contributor to its results.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2021, Deere experienced a five-week strike by more than 10,000 UAW workers, which indicates that its relationship with its unionized workforce is not without challenges. While the strike was resolved, it highlights the potential for labor disputes to disrupt operations. The company's 2024 10-K notes that a significant portion of its workforce is unionized. While day-to-day relations may be stable, the recent history of a major strike prevents a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's investor relations website and SEC filings list a full slate of executive officers with diverse backgrounds and experience.

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm (Deloitte & Touche LLP), and the company has consistently received an unqualified audit opinion.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's key competitive advantage is its extensive dealer network, which provides a moat around its business. The company's focus on precision agriculture and its growing suite of technology products, such as the See & Spray system, are also key differentiators. This technology creates a switching cost for farmers, as they become accustomed to the Deere ecosystem.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere has consistently invested in R&D and capital expenditures, even during periods of market downturn. The company's focus on developing new technologies, such as autonomous tractors and precision agriculture solutions, demonstrates a willingness to invest for the long term.

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of April 27, 2025, Deere had $6.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company also has a strong investment-grade credit rating, which gives it access to the debt markets at attractive rates. Deere has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, rather than issuing new shares.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837025008218/de-20250427x10q.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's management team holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed presentations to investors. During the recent market downturn for agricultural equipment, the company has been transparent about the challenges it is facing and has provided a clear outlook for the future. The company's investor relations website provides a wealth of information for investors.

**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Deere & Company scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong marks for its long-term growth prospects, commitment to R&D, and financial strength. The company's extensive dealer network and its leadership in precision agriculture are key competitive advantages. The one area of concern is labor relations, given the 2021 strike. The score could change in the next 12-24 months based on the company's ability to navigate the current downturn in the agricultural equipment market and continue to execute on its technology roadmap. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" on labor relations if the company can demonstrate a period of stability and positive engagement with its unionized workforce.

fisher score is 14 / 15
