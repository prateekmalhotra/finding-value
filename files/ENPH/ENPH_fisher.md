**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K filing lists a stable executive team under the leadership of President and CEO Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman. There is no indication of significant executive turnover or internal conflicts. The proxy statement, which would provide more detail on executive compensation and board structure, is referenced in the 10-K but not provided.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the CEO, the 2024 10-K and other public information list key executives in finance, operations, and product development, indicating a functional leadership structure. The company is organized into functional areas rather than distinct operating segments, with the CEO identified as the chief operating decision-maker. The 10-K also lists a board of directors with experience in relevant industries.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The 10-K provides detailed segment information and a breakdown of costs. Management concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enphase's key competitive advantage is its microinverter technology, which offers advantages in productivity, reliability, and safety over traditional string inverters. The company's focus on a complete home energy system, including storage and EV charging, all managed by a single software platform, creates a strong ecosystem and potential for customer lock-in.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enphase continues to invest heavily in research and development, even during periods of revenue decline, indicating a focus on long-term technological leadership. The company's expansion into new geographic markets and product categories also suggests a long-range growth strategy. The move to US-based manufacturing, despite initial higher costs, is a long-term strategic decision to de-risk the supply chain and benefit from government incentives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Enphase had $1.7 billion in net working capital, including cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company has a share repurchase program in place, having repurchased $391.4 million of common stock in 2024. The balance sheet is strong with a net cash balance. The company has convertible notes outstanding, which could be dilutive if converted, but the company expects to settle the principal in cash.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFuD5IMMsxs7QSIiBDOtjU7V1wNW0BcYVJZWfQv_XLtScZYuH4CpFWybJEuzAQdPGOOIk17kdzmdBxSNYsd8UycGMaTwVfP_AAl7kzy1fYbMsVcMLrLva12AEcpAnTEYaSpHA39qhV185pybDr-9CRXxZUEPIZJX37bkHQ2_2IS0i-eLYrZRoe0DW_I0SXzaTvgxP7JhDDM17sA_JfFht_daLJGgrfhxBzRXsnOScjoqfBTU7azo9i1N6Jr618=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFuD5IMMsxs7QSIiBDOtjU7V1wNW0BcYVJZWfQv_XLtScZYuH4CpFWybJEuzAQdPGOOIk17kdzmdBxSNYsd8UycGMaTwVfP_AAl7kzy1fYbMsVcMLrLva12AEcpAnTEYaSpHA39qhV185pybDr-9CRXxZUEPIZJX37bkHQ2_2IS0i-eLYrZRoe0DW_I0SXzaTvgxP7JhDDM17sA_JfFht_daLJGgrfhxBzRXsnOScjoqfBTU7azo9i1N6Jr618=) (January 21, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K openly discusses the business slowdown in the US and Europe, attributing it to higher interest rates, channel inventory, and policy changes. The company provides detailed financial statements and a thorough Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The company hosts regular earnings calls with analysts, and transcripts are publicly available.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K discloses pending securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits against the company and some of its officers and directors, alleging false and/or misleading statements. While the company disputes the allegations and intends to defend the matters vigorously, the presence of such lawsuits raises questions about management's integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
Enphase Energy scores well on most of Fisher's 15 points, demonstrating a strong product portfolio with a long growth runway, a commitment to innovation, and a solid financial position. The company's strategic shift to becoming a comprehensive home energy management provider, coupled with its international expansion, positions it to capitalize on the growing global demand for clean energy solutions. However, the score is negatively impacted by the presence of securities class action and shareholder derivative lawsuits, which raise concerns about management's integrity. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the resolution of these legal proceedings, the success of the company's expansion into new product and geographic markets, and its ability to navigate the current macroeconomic headwinds and return to strong revenue growth. A dismissal of the lawsuits would flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes," significantly improving the overall Fisher score.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
