**Synthesis**

ADP scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong market position, consistent growth, and experienced management team. The company's key strengths include its large and diverse client base, its commitment to innovation, and its strong financial position. The primary factors that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are a slowdown in the global economy, which could impact demand for its services, and increased competition from new entrants in the HCM market. To turn a "No" into a "Yes", the company would need to provide more detailed disclosure on its R&D spending and the effectiveness of its R&D efforts.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
