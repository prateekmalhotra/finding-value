PVH Corp. Analysis, August 22, 2025. Primary sources reviewed: Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 4, 2025, and various reputable news and data sources.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH's growth strategy, the "PVH+ Plan," is centered on its two iconic brands, *TOMMY HILFIGER* and *Calvin Klein*, which together generate over 95% of its revenue. The company is focused on high-growth potential in Europe and Asia, with over 70% of its revenue already generated outside the United States. However, the company faces a "complex and challenging retail environment, particularly in North America," and saw a 13% revenue decrease in the APAC region in the most recent quarter. While the brands have global recognition, near-term headwinds in key markets and macroeconomic pressures create uncertainty about achieving sizable sales increases.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is executing the PVH+ Plan, a multi-year strategy to elevate its core brands. A key initiative is bringing licensed product categories, such as women's apparel from G-III Apparel Group, in-house to gain direct control over product and marketing. The company is also investing in its direct-to-consumer channels, with its owned and operated digital commerce sites growing 3% in the recent quarter. This demonstrates a clear commitment to evolving its operating model and investing in growth areas like e-commerce.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Interpreting R&D as brand development and marketing, PVH's effectiveness shows mixed results. In Q1 2025, the company spent $98.9 million on marketing. This supported a 3% revenue increase for *Tommy Hilfiger*, but *Calvin Klein* revenue was flat. The company's overall revenue grew only 2%, which does not indicate highly effective output from its brand development and marketing investments in the current environment. While the brands remain powerful, recent performance does not suggest superior effectiveness compared to the company's large scale.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH's sales performance is inconsistent across channels. The wholesale channel grew 6% in Q1 2025, driven by strength in Europe and the Americas. However, the direct-to-consumer business declined 3%, with owned-and-operated retail store revenue falling 5% due to challenging consumer environments. An above-average sales organization should demonstrate strength across its key channels, and the current weakness in the direct-to-consumer segment prevents such a conclusion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH's gross profit margin for the last twelve months was 58.8%. This is strong relative to industry competitors like Nike (42.7%), Columbia Sportswear (50.3%), and VF Corporation (53.5%). However, the gross margin for the most recent quarter fell 280 basis points to 58.6% from 61.4% in the prior year due to increased promotions and higher costs. Furthermore, the company's net margin of 4.63% trails that of key competitors like Columbia Sportswear (6.59%). While the gross margin is high, its recent decline and weaker net margin prevent an unqualified "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)], [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/PVH/competitors/ (Accessed August 22, 2025)], [https://finbox.com/NYSE:PVH/explorer/gp_margin (Accessed August 22, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As part of its PVH+ Plan, the company is undertaking "Growth Driver 5 Actions," a multi-year initiative to simplify its operating model through process centralization and automation. This program is expected to generate annual cost savings of $200 million to $300 million by 2026. These actions, including headcount reductions and optimizing its distribution network, represent a clear and significant effort to improve long-term profitability and efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Evidence on labor relations is mixed and does not support an "outstanding" rating. The "Growth Driver 5 Actions" aimed at improving efficiency resulted in $13.2 million in severance costs in Q1 2025, indicating recent layoffs. While a 2021 study rated PVH as a "great place to work," more recent employee reviews are mixed, with some citing poor management. Zippia reports strong employee retention of 4.6 years but notes that average pay is lower than at top competitors. The combination of recent layoffs and mixed employee feedback suggests relations are not outstanding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)], [https://greatplacetowork.com/certified-company/1100502 (Accessed August 22, 2025)], [https://www.comparably.com/companies/pvh/reviews (Accessed August 22, 2025)], [https://www.zippia.com/pvh-careers-10214/ (March 14, 2024)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been notable turnover in key leadership roles recently. In May 2025, David Savman was appointed Global Brand President for Calvin Klein, succeeding Eva Serrano who is transitioning to an advisor role. In late 2023 and early 2024, the company appointed a new President for Tommy Hilfiger North America and promoted a new Chief People Officer, with the prior CPO leaving "to pursue other opportunities." This level of change in critical brand and functional leadership positions over a short period suggests a lack of stability and does not align with the criterion for "outstanding" executive relations.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has recently reorganized its leadership structure to be region-focused, with new reportable segments of EMEA, Americas, and APAC. This structure, with regional leadership reporting to the CEO, indicates a formal layer of senior management below the executive team. The recent appointment of David Savman, the former Chief Supply Chain Officer, to Global Brand President of Calvin Klein also shows that the company can fill key roles from an internal bench of executives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)], [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250508588825/en/PVH-Corp.-Announces-Leadership-Update (May 8, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's Form 10-Q explicitly states that its disclosure controls and procedures were "not effective as of May 4, 2025 due to a previously identified material weakness in internal control over financial reporting." This is a direct and significant negative indicator from the company's own filings regarding the quality of its accounting controls. While the company is working on remediation, the existence of a material weakness forces a negative conclusion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the apparel industry, brand equity is the paramount competitive advantage. PVH owns two globally powerful brands in *Calvin Klein* and *Tommy Hilfiger*. The company's PVH+ strategy is centered on strengthening the direct control and desirability of these core assets. However, PVH's competitive standing is currently challenged by significant geopolitical risk. The company was placed on China's "List of Unreliable Entities" in February 2025, which could lead to fines or restrictions on its ability to do business in a critical market, creating a unique and material disadvantage.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is clearly prioritizing long-term goals through its multi-year PVH+ Plan. This involves near-term costs to achieve future benefits, such as restructuring charges to fund efficiency programs and an expected 50 basis point margin decline in 2025 from bringing licensed businesses in-house. These actions demonstrate a willingness to absorb short-term financial pressure in order to strengthen brand control, improve the operating model, and drive durable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong record of returning capital to shareholders and reducing share count, not issuing new equity. On April 1, 2025, PVH initiated a $500 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, and $1.212 billion remained available under its total repurchase authorization as of May 4, 2025. The company is funding these buybacks and its operations with cash on hand and debt, indicating a strong financial position that does not require dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the latest 10-Q is notably transparent about numerous challenges. It details the negative impacts of a difficult retail environment, the reasons for gross margin decline, the ongoing material weakness in internal controls, and provides specific details on the investigation by China's Ministry of Commerce. This level of disclosure about significant operational, financial, and regulatory problems demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are multiple significant issues that call management's integrity into question. In February 2025, PVH was placed on China's "List of Unreliable Entities" following a government investigation. Additionally, in June 2025, G-III Apparel Group filed a $250 million lawsuit against PVH, alleging breach of contract and tortious interference related to their licensing agreements. The existence of a government blacklisting in a major market and a major lawsuit from a long-term partner casts serious doubt on the integrity of management's business practices.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm (June 4, 2025)], [https://www.fashionnetwork.com/news/G-iii-accuses-pvh-of-breach-of-contract-in-250-million-suit,1646039.html (June 24, 2025)]

**Synthesis**

PVH Corp. scores poorly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a company with strong, iconic brands that is currently facing significant operational, financial, and legal headwinds. The strongest positives are its commitment to a long-range strategic plan (the PVH+ Plan), its clear efforts to improve margins through cost savings, and its strong balance sheet, which allows for substantial share buybacks without shareholder dilution. However, these are overshadowed by numerous negatives, including faltering sales growth, declining margins, a material weakness in accounting controls, recent executive turnover, and, most critically, severe questions regarding management integrity stemming from a Chinese government blacklisting and a major lawsuit from a key business partner. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on three variables: the resolution of the China "Unreliable Entities" listing and its impact on revenue, the outcome of the $250 million G-III lawsuit, and the successful remediation of its material weakness in internal controls. Evidence of a favorable resolution to the legal and regulatory issues and a clean audit opinion on internal controls would be required to flip the "No" answers on points 10, 11, and 15.

fisher score is 5 / 15
