### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate-Palmolive operates in the stable, albeit mature, consumer staples sector. Growth is supported by its significant presence in emerging markets, which account for 45% of sales and offer demographic tailwinds. The global oral care market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 4-6% through 2032, providing a steady runway. Furthermore, the company's Hill's Pet Nutrition segment (22% of 2024 sales) operates in the global pet food market, which is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 5-6% through 2035, driven by trends in pet humanization and premiumization. The company's strategy focuses on science-led innovation and expanding into higher-growth segments to capture this potential.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's stated strategy is to drive organic sales growth through "science-led, core and premium innovation" and expanding into adjacent, higher-growth categories. This commitment is demonstrated by a strategic focus on R&D and marketing, with the company noting it has brought products to market in 6-12 months, down from 18-36 months historically. In its 2024 10-K, the company emphasizes building capabilities in innovation, digital, data, and analytics to be more responsive to market changes. The company forecasts investing over 13% of sales into marketing to support new and existing products.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, Colgate-Palmolive's R&D expenses were approximately $355 million, representing about 1.8% of its $20.1 billion in revenue. While this percentage is modest compared to technology or pharmaceutical companies, it is in line with the consumer staples industry. The effectiveness is demonstrated not by the spending ratio but by the output: the company has achieved 24 consecutive quarters of organic sales growth at or above its 3%-5% target, driven by its renewed focus on innovation. Management has also improved time-to-market for new products from 18-36 months down to 6-12 months, indicating increased R&D efficiency.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate-Palmolive's sales organization is proven by its dominant global market position. For the full year 2024, the company held a 41.4% global market share in toothpaste and a 32.2% share in manual toothbrushes. The company's products are sold in over 200 countries and territories through a sophisticated network of retailers, wholesalers, distributors, and direct-to-consumer channels. According to Kantar's Brand Footprint report, Colgate is the only brand purchased by over half the world's households, a testament to its unmatched global penetration and sales effectiveness.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates strong and improving profitability. In 2024, Colgate-Palmolive reported a Gross Profit Margin of 60.5% and an Operating Profit Margin of 21.2%. These figures represent an improvement over 2023, where the gross margin was 58.2% and the operating margin was 20.5%. These margins are robust for the consumer packaged goods industry, reflecting significant pricing power and operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin expansion through several key initiatives. The 2024 gross margin improvement was attributed to cost savings from "funding-the-growth initiatives" and higher pricing, which more than offset higher raw and packaging material costs. The company also recently concluded its "2022 Global Productivity Initiative," which is expected to deliver approximately $125 million in annualized pretax savings. These ongoing productivity programs and disciplined pricing strategies demonstrate a clear commitment to maintaining and improving margins.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company employed approximately 34,000 people as of year-end 2024, with a portion represented by unions or works councils. Colgate publicly states a commitment to its values of "Caring, Inclusive and Courageous" and respecting human and labor rights, including freedom of association and collective bargaining. A search of public records and news archives reveals no major widespread labor disputes or strikes in recent years. The company's disclosure statements detail policies against harassment and for fair wages and working hours. The evidence points to stable and professionally managed labor relations.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate-Palmolive's senior leadership team exhibits stability and deep company experience. Chairman, President and CEO Noel Wallace has been with the company since 1987. Other executive officers, such as the Group Presidents and Chief Legal Officer, also have long tenures, indicating a stable and cohesive management team. The 10-K explicitly mentions a "rigorous succession planning process" with extensive Board involvement, suggesting a focus on smooth leadership transitions and internal development.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public disclosures outline a deep and experienced management team beyond the CEO. The 2024 10-K lists seven executive officers, including a CFO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and two Group Presidents with responsibility for "Growth and Strategy" and "Europe and Developing Markets," respectively. This structure suggests a clear division of senior-level responsibility and a bench of experienced leaders managing key business functions and geographies. The company's long history of promoting from within further supports the existence of management depth.

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate-Palmolive's financial reporting indicates robust controls. The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. In Item 9A of the 10-K, management states its conclusion that the company's disclosure controls and procedures are effective. The company's detailed segment reporting and consistent financial disclosures further suggest strong internal accounting and cost analysis capabilities.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the consumer packaged goods industry, brand equity and global reach are paramount. Colgate's key advantage is its unparalleled brand penetration. For years, Kantar's Brand Footprint study has identified Colgate as the only brand bought by over half of the world's households, reaching a 55.9% penetration rate in the most recent report. This incredible reach creates a significant barrier to entry, gives the company leverage with retailers, and provides a platform for introducing new products to a massive, established consumer base. This global consumer franchise is a unique and powerful competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes the importance of long-term brand health through sustained investment, even when facing short-term pressures. In 2024, advertising investment increased 14.7% to $2.72 billion, representing 13.5% of sales, up from 12.2% in 2023. This willingness to increase brand-building investment during a period of cost inflation demonstrates a long-range perspective. Management has repeatedly stated its commitment to directing resources toward innovation and marketing to ensure the long-term health of the business, rather than maximizing near-term profits at the expense of brand equity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, precluding the need for dilutive equity financing. In 2024, the company generated $4.1 billion in net cash from operations. This cash flow comfortably funds capital expenditures ($561 million) and dividends ($1.79 billion). Rather than issuing shares, the company actively returns capital to shareholders, repurchasing $1.74 billion of its own stock in 2024 under a $5 billion share repurchase program.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of transparency in its communications. The 2024 10-K provides a detailed and candid "Risk Factors" section and an "Outlook" that forthrightly discusses challenges like inflation, foreign currency volatility, and heightened competitive activity. In public transcripts, management addresses both successes and challenges. For example, the 10-K clearly discloses the negative impact of foreign exchange on sales and details challenges in specific regions. This level of detail in public filings and investor communications suggests a culture of candor.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has maintained a strong reputation for integrity over its long history. Its 2024 10-K details a comprehensive Code of Conduct, in place since 1987, that applies to all employees and directors and covers topics like anti-corruption and ethical behavior. Recent legal issues appear minor for a company of its size. In early 2024, the company settled a class-action lawsuit for approximately $1.9 million related to a 2023 recall of Fabuloso cleaning products due to bacterial contamination, an issue it had already addressed with a voluntary recall. This matter does not suggest a systemic failure of integrity at the management level.

**Synthesis**
Colgate-Palmolive scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its status as a high-quality, blue-chip global enterprise. The company's strongest positives are its incredible brand penetration, dominant market shares in core categories, robust and improving profit margins, and disciplined financial management that generates strong cash flow and shareholder returns. Its management team is stable, experienced, and demonstrates a clear long-term strategic focus on innovation and brand building. The primary variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months would be a failure to maintain its growth trajectory in the high-potential Pet Nutrition segment or a significant loss of market share in its core Oral Care business to competitors. Evidence of sustained margin compression due to an inability to offset cost inflation with pricing and productivity would also be a major concern and could flip the "Margin Improvement Actions" point to "No."

**Fisher Score is 15 / 15**
