Company: Six Flags Entertainment Corporation (FUN)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: FY2024 10-K, Q1 & Q2 2025 10-Q filings, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Six Flags operates in the regional theme park market, a segment of the broader leisure industry. The company's growth is tied to population growth in its markets and its ability to attract visitors with new rides and events. The recent merger with Cedar Fair, which is expected to close in the coming months, will create a larger, more diversified portfolio of parks across North America, which management claims will unlock new revenue streams. However, the core regional theme park business is mature, and growth is likely to be incremental rather than transformative.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Six Flags consistently invests in new rides, attractions, and in-park offerings to drive attendance and guest spending. The company's capital expenditure plans, detailed in its quarterly filings, are primarily directed toward new attractions and park improvements. For 2025, the company has announced a pipeline of new rides and themed areas across its parks, including new roller coasters and water park expansions. This demonstrates a commitment to refreshing the product line to stimulate repeat visitation and attract new customers.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a theme park, "R&D" is best measured by capital expenditures on new attractions and their return on investment through attendance and revenue growth. The company does not disclose R&D spending as a separate line item. While Six Flags regularly introduces new rides, their effectiveness has been inconsistent in recent years, with attendance figures fluctuating. Without specific metrics on the ROI of new attractions versus peers, it is difficult to definitively assess the effectiveness of their development efforts.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Six Flags' sales efforts are focused on driving attendance through season passes, group sales, and single-day tickets. The company has a sophisticated pricing and marketing system, and has been increasingly focused on digital engagement to drive sales. However, recent attendance figures have lagged behind pre-pandemic levels, suggesting that the sales and marketing efforts have not been as effective as they could be in a competitive leisure environment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000154/fun-20250629.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q2 2025 earnings report, Six Flags reported a net income margin of 7.5%. For the full year 2024, the net income margin was 5.2%. These margins are relatively thin and have been under pressure from rising operating costs and inconsistent attendance. While the company has the potential for higher margins during peak season, its overall profitability is not consistently high.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000154/fun-20250629.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through a combination of pricing strategies, cost controls, and operational efficiencies. In recent earnings calls, the company has highlighted its efforts to optimize marketing spend, reduce overhead, and implement new technologies to improve labor productivity. The pending merger with Cedar Fair is also expected to generate significant cost synergies, which should be a major driver of margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company relies heavily on seasonal labor, and its financial filings frequently cite labor costs and the availability of seasonal workers as key risk factors. There have been no reports of major labor disputes or widespread employee dissatisfaction. However, the nature of the seasonal, low-wage workforce in the theme park industry makes it difficult to achieve "outstanding" labor relations in the way Fisher likely intended.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The pending merger with Cedar Fair will result in a significant shake-up of the executive team, with the CEO of Cedar Fair set to lead the combined company. This indicates a planned and orderly transition of leadership. There have been no recent reports of public disputes or infighting among the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a full slate of executives in key roles such as finance, operations, and marketing. The planned leadership team for the combined company with Cedar Fair draws from both organizations, suggesting that there is a good bench of talent. However, the performance of the company in recent years raises questions about the overall effectiveness of the management team below the CEO.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and there have been no recent reports of material weaknesses in internal controls or accounting irregularities. The company provides detailed segment reporting, which gives investors a good view of the performance of its different park operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the theme park industry, intellectual property (IP) licensing and brand recognition are key competitive advantages. Six Flags has licensing agreements with Warner Bros. and DC Comics, which allow it to use popular characters in its parks. The company's brand is also well-known, particularly in the thrill ride niche. However, it faces intense competition from Disney, Universal, and its merger partner Cedar Fair, which have stronger IP and more diverse entertainment offerings.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's decision to pursue the merger with Cedar Fair is a clear indication of a long-range outlook. The merger is a strategic move to create a more resilient and diversified company, even though it comes with significant near-term integration costs and risks. The company's ongoing capital investments in its parks also demonstrate a willingness to reinvest in the business for future growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 29, 2025, Six Flags had a significant amount of debt on its balance sheet. The company's cash flow from operations is sufficient to cover its planned capital expenditures, but its high leverage limits its financial flexibility. The merger with Cedar Fair is structured as a merger of equals, but any future large-scale expansion projects could require the company to raise additional capital, potentially through equity financing.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000154/fun-20250629.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management regularly hosts earnings calls and provides detailed presentations to investors. In recent calls, they have been open about the challenges the company is facing, including weak attendance trends and the complexities of the pending merger. They have also laid out a clear strategy for addressing these issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/FUN/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There have been no recent reports of major scandals, regulatory investigations, or governance issues that would call into question the integrity of the management team. The company has a code of conduct and ethics policy, and its financial filings are subject to regulatory oversight.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

Synthesis:
Six Flags Entertainment Corporation presents a mixed bag when viewed through the lens of Philip Fisher's 15 points. The company's strengths lie in its commitment to ongoing development, its long-range outlook exemplified by the Cedar Fair merger, and its transparency with investors. However, the company is hampered by a mature core market, inconsistent profitability, and a leveraged balance sheet. The most significant variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the successful integration of Cedar Fair. If the merger delivers the promised cost synergies and revenue growth, it could flip the "No" answers on profit margins and financial strength to "Yes". Conversely, a fumbled integration or a downturn in the economy could further pressure the company's already weak financial metrics.

fisher score is 7 / 15
