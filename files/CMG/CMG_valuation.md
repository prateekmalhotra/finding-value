### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FCFF** | **$1,003.7** | **$1,061.2** | **$1,121.9** | **$1,185.8** | **$1,253.1** |

*This valuation uses Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.*

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.25% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium. |
| Beta | 1.25 | Reflects CMG's higher volatility relative to the broader market. (Yahoo Finance, August 22, 2025) |
| Cost of Equity | 10.5% | 4.25% + 1.25 \* 5.0% |
| Cost of Debt | 0.0% | No debt. |
| **WACC** | **10.5%** | Since there is no debt, WACC equals the Cost of Equity. |

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Assumed long-run inflation rate)
*   **Terminal Value (Gordon Growth):** (Year 5 FCFF \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($1,253.1 \* 1.025) / (0.105 - 0.025) = **$16,048.4 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** Based on a historical median EV/EBITDA multiple of approximately 25x for CMG, the exit multiple based terminal value would be significantly higher. The Gordon Growth method is used for a more conservative and fundamentals-based terminal value.
