Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio primarily serves the US real estate industry. Management, in its 2024 10-K, estimates its addressable market at approximately $14 billion, indicating significant room for growth from its TTM revenue. The company is expanding its TAM by moving into larger customer segments and offering new value-added services like payments, screening, and insurance. The continued digitization of the real estate industry provides a durable tailwind.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio has a demonstrated history of expanding its product suite from a core system of record to a broader platform with value-added services. The company is investing heavily in generative AI and data analytics to automate workflows and provide actionable insights for customers. Management has also indicated a focus on expanding its offerings for larger, more complex customers.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio's R&D expense was approximately 22% of revenue in 2024, a significant investment. The company has a strong track record of launching new products and features that are adopted by its customer base, driving growth in value-added services. However, a direct comparison of R&D effectiveness to competitors is difficult without specific data on product launch success rates and market share gains.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio has consistently grown its customer base, reaching over 20,000 property management customers by the end of 2024. The company's dollar-based net expansion rate has been consistently above 100%, indicating that existing customers are spending more over time. This suggests an effective sales and customer success motion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio's non-GAAP operating margin was 23% in 2024, a significant improvement from previous years. This is a strong margin for a SaaS company and indicates a scalable business model. The company has guided for continued margin expansion in 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000055/appf-20250331.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio is focused on several initiatives to drive margin improvement. These include scaling its value-added services, which have higher incremental margins than its core subscription offerings. The company is also leveraging automation and AI to improve operational efficiency and control costs. Additionally, as the company grows, it is benefiting from economies of scale.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio is frequently listed as a "best place to work" in various publications. The company's 2024 10-K emphasizes its commitment to a positive and inclusive culture. There are no indications of significant labor disputes or unionization efforts. While this is a positive sign, it is difficult to definitively assess the state of personnel relations without more direct employee feedback.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been some turnover in the executive team in recent years, including a CEO transition in 2024. While the company has a succession plan in place, this level of change can be disruptive. However, the new CEO has been with the company for several years, which should provide some continuity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319524000106/appf-20240630.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's proxy statement provides biographies of its executive officers, which shows a team with experience in the software and real estate industries. However, beyond the named executive officers, there is limited public information about the next level of management. This makes it difficult to fully assess the depth of the management bench.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, and the company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting. The company provides a good level of detail in its segment reporting, which allows for a reasonable analysis of its cost structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio's integrated platform, which combines core property management functionality with a growing suite of value-added services, creates high switching costs for customers. This ecosystem effect is a significant competitive advantage in the real estate software market. The company's focus on serving the specific needs of property managers has also allowed it to build a strong brand and reputation in its niche.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio has historically prioritized growth over short-term profitability, investing heavily in R&D and sales and marketing. However, the company has recently started to focus more on balancing growth and profitability, as evidenced by its improving operating margins. This suggests a more balanced approach, but one that is still focused on the long term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AppFolio has a strong balance sheet with a healthy cash position and no long-term debt. The company has been generating positive cash flow from operations, which should be sufficient to fund its growth initiatives. This reduces the risk of future equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000105/appf-20250630.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed commentary on its quarterly earnings calls and in its SEC filings. They are generally transparent about their strategy, financial performance, and the risks facing the business. However, without a significant negative event to observe their communication style, it is difficult to fully assess their candor in times of trouble.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000105/appf-20250630.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/APPF/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no legal or regulatory actions against the company or its executives that would suggest a lack of integrity. The company has a code of conduct and ethics, and its governance practices are in line with market standards.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1433195/000143319525000013/appf-20241231.htm']

---
Synthesis: AppFolio scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its primary strengths being a large addressable market, a strong product offering with high switching costs, and a scalable business model that is now generating significant profits. The recent executive turnover and lack of public information on management depth are the main areas of concern. Over the next 12-24 months, the key variables to watch will be the company's ability to continue to innovate and launch new products, its success in moving upmarket to serve larger customers, and its ability to maintain its high growth rate while expanding margins. A "No" on executive relations could flip to a "Yes" with a period of stability in the leadership team, while a "No" on management depth could be addressed with more disclosure on the next level of management.

fisher score is 13 / 15
