### **4) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Value / Path | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **-15% Yr 1, 2% Yrs 2-5** | Using the low-end of management's segment guidance which implies a blended decline, followed by modest growth. |
| **Operating Margin** | **14.0%** | A conservative margin below recent historical levels, reflecting market contraction. |
| **Tax Rate** | **24.0%** | A conservative rate slightly above the recent effective tax rate. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **9.9%** | Based on the most recent TTM capital intensity. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **4.4%** | Based on the most recent TTM D&A as a percentage of revenue. |
| **Working Capital** | **$0** | Assuming working capital changes normalize to zero for a conservative forecast. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.35%** | Based on the most recent TTM SBC as a percentage of revenue. |

### **5) Free Cash Flow Build**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 38,733 | 39,508 | 40,298 | 41,104 | 41,926 |
| EBIT | 5,423 | 5,531 | 5,642 | 5,755 | 5,870 |
| EBIT(1-T) | 4,121 | 4,204 | 4,288 | 4,373 | 4,461 |
| + D&A | 1,704 | 1,738 | 1,773 | 1,809 | 1,845 |
| - Capex | (3,835) | (3,911) | (3,989) | (4,069) | (4,151) |
| - Change in WC | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **FCFF** | **1,990** | **2,031** | **2,072** | **2,113** | **2,155** |

### **6) Discount Rate**

*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (Current 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield)
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** 6.5% (Conservative estimate)
*   **Beta:** 1.0 (Conservative assumption for a large, cyclical industrial company)
*   **Cost of Equity:** 4.25% + 1.0 * 6.5% = **10.75%**
*   **Cost of Debt:** 5.0% (Inferred from Interest Expense / Total Debt)
*   **WACC:** Using a market cap of ~$130B and Net Debt of ~$58B, the WACC is calculated as **8.8%**.

### **7) Terminal Value**

*   **Method:** Gordon Growth Model
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0% (Conservative long-term inflation proxy)
*   **Terminal Value:** (Year 5 FCFF * (1+g)) / (WACC - g) = ($2,155 * 1.02) / (0.088 - 0.02) = **$32,328M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** Terminal Value implies a ~5.5x EBIT multiple, which is conservative.

### **8) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Item | Value (USD Millions) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF | 8,364 | Calculated from FCFF table |
| PV of Terminal Value | 21,570 | Calculated from Terminal Value |
| **Enterprise Value** | **29,934** | Sum of PV of FCFF and PV of Terminal Value |
| (-) Net Debt | 58,330 | $66,321M Debt - $7,991M Cash |
| **Equity Value** | **(28,396)** | Enterprise Value - Net Debt |

*Note: The negative equity value indicates that under these conservative assumptions, the company's debt exceeds the value of its future cash flows.*

### **9) Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Low:** $0 (Due to negative equity value)
*   **Base:** $0 (Due to negative equity value)
*   **High:** A positive valuation would require more optimistic growth and margin assumptions than supported by conservative interpretation of management guidance.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** Not applicable due to negative intrinsic value.

### **10) One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key downside risks to this valuation include a deeper or more prolonged downturn in the agricultural and construction markets than anticipated, leading to further revenue declines and margin compression. Higher-than-expected interest rates could continue to suppress equipment demand and increase financing costs. Additionally, unforeseen supply chain disruptions or a failure to innovate and maintain technological leadership could erode Deere's competitive position and profitability.
