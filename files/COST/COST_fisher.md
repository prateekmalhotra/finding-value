Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 11, 2025; Earnings call transcript for the quarter ended May 11, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco continues to demonstrate strong sales growth, driven by both comparable sales increases at existing stores and a steady pace of new warehouse openings. The company expanded from 890 warehouses at the end of fiscal 2024 to 905 by May 11, 2025, with plans for continued expansion. The company's international presence is less penetrated than its U.S. operations, offering a long runway for unit growth, and management has stated its expectation for this to continue. Continued investment in its e-commerce business, which saw 15.7% adjusted growth in Q3 2025, provides another vector for future sales increases.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management shows a clear commitment to development through consistent investment in its high-margin Kirkland Signature private label brand, with the stated goal of increasing its sales penetration. The company is making significant capital expenditures for "new and remodeled warehouses, information systems and manufacturing and distribution facilities," with a planned spend of over $5.0 billion in fiscal 2025. This spending is targeted at improving logistics and technology to support future growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983225000033/cost-20250511.htm' (May 11, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's "research and development" is embedded in its merchandising strategy and operational efficiency efforts, not in a formal R&D department. The growth and profitability of the Kirkland Signature brand demonstrate effective product development. Similarly, the company’s pioneering of the warehouse club model and its efficient logistics system represent successful process innovation. However, the company does not disclose specific metrics on these innovation-related investments, making it difficult to benchmark their effectiveness against peers in a quantifiable way.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco’s sales model is fundamentally tied to its membership structure, where its performance is exceptional. The company maintains very high membership renewal rates, with the U.S. and Canada rate at 92.7% as of May 11, 2025. It has also consistently grown its member base, with paid households increasing 6.8% year-over-year to 79.6 million. The high penetration of premium "Executive" members, who account for over 73% of worldwide sales, further demonstrates the sales organization's effectiveness in upselling and creating loyal, high-spending customers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983225000033/cost-20250511.htm' (May 11, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco operates on a deliberately low gross margin model (around 11%) to drive sales volume and reinforce its price leadership image. While this is lower than typical retailers, the company's overall profitability is strong and consistent, with an operating margin of approximately 4.1% in the third quarter of 2025. The "worthwhile" nature of its margin comes from the high-margin membership fee revenue ($1.24 billion in Q3 2025), which constituted nearly half of its operating income and provides a stable, recurring source of profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983225000033/cost-20250511.htm' (May 11, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco actively works to maintain and improve its unique margin structure. A key stated strategy is increasing the sales penetration of its higher-margin private label, Kirkland Signature. The company also focuses on operational efficiencies in its supply chain and "no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities" to control costs. Management actively manages merchandise mix and pricing to optimize profitability, as shown by margin gains in fresh foods and e-commerce in the third quarter of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983225000033/cost-20250511.htm' (May 11, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco has a well-documented history of excellent labor relations, which it considers core to its mission. The company pays competitive wages, with an average hourly rate of approximately $31 in the U.S. as of September 1, 2024, and provides comprehensive benefits. This commitment results in very low employee turnover, with a retention rate of approximately 93% for employees with over a year of service in the U.S. and Canada.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates strong and stable executive relations, characterized by extremely long tenures and a culture of promoting from within. As noted in its 2024 10-K, most executive officers have over 25 years of service with the company. The recent and orderly CEO succession, with the long-time CFO remaining for a transitional period, further exemplifies a stable and well-planned leadership structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's management team exhibits significant depth, with a structure of multiple senior executives overseeing distinct geographical and functional areas. The 2024 10-K lists several Executive Vice Presidents and COOs for different divisions (Northern, Southwest, Eastern, International), indicating a deep bench of senior leadership with clear operational responsibilities. The biographies of these executives show a consistent pattern of long careers at Costco, rising through various management roles, which ensures operational continuity and a deep understanding of the company's culture.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's accounting controls appear robust and effective. Costco's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024. Management's own assessment, as detailed in the same report, also concluded that its internal controls were effective. Furthermore, the company has reported no material changes to its internal controls in subsequent quarters and has no recent history of material financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983225000033/cost-20250511.htm' (May 11, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's business model contains several industry-specific clues to its outstanding competitive position. The membership model is a primary advantage, creating a loyal customer base and a significant, high-margin revenue stream that allows the company to price merchandise at very low margins. The Kirkland Signature private label is another key differentiator, providing high-quality, low-cost alternatives to national brands that drive customer loyalty and higher margins. The combination of a limited SKU count and massive sales volume gives Costco enormous buying power, creating a virtuous cycle of lower costs and lower prices that is difficult for competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently signals a long-range outlook, often prioritizing market share and member loyalty over short-term profit maximization. The company's core philosophy is to maintain its "pricing authority" by keeping merchandise margins low, even if it means forgoing near-term profits. Similarly, Costco invests in its employees by paying industry-leading wages and benefits, viewing it as a long-term investment in productivity and service rather than a short-term expense to be minimized.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's financial position is exceptionally strong, mitigating any foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing. The company generates substantial cash flow from operations, which for the 36 weeks ended May 11, 2025, was $9.5 billion, far exceeding its capital expenditures of $3.5 billion. The balance sheet is robust, with $13.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Rather than issuing shares, Costco consistently returns capital to shareholders through a significant stock repurchase program and regular dividends.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983225000033/cost-20250511.htm' (May 11, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor with investors. In their third-quarter 2025 earnings call, executives openly discussed negative factors alongside positive results, such as the $35 million negative impact of foreign exchange rates and a $130 million LIFO charge that impacted margins. They also proactively explained that a slight dip in renewal rates was anticipated due to the onboarding of digital members, who renew at a lower rate, rather than obscuring the metric. This practice of transparently addressing challenges indicates that management does not "clam up" when discussing headwinds.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFxWmBlw1xQ6Dv2UGlgkJgYXjHYRBQPckzg1dep5lulIBvxjtvrygYu66pXBGhODd0MD1HPO9DXRImX9HAo39XLerM8DBdZF5mCu_oeDQ0HuiJUnN1g0yAihWeBHD_fYdzRb4ghF946r836vSSkMba8BgElXWbG1Q==' (May 29, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a code of ethics and robust governance structures. While the company is involved in various legal proceedings, including labor-related class actions and a False Claims Act investigation, this is not uncommon for a retailer of its vast scale. The filings do not indicate any material adverse findings, sanctions, or significant related-party transactions that would call the integrity of its senior management into question. Barring significant negative outcomes from the disclosed legal matters, management's integrity appears solid.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983225000033/cost-20250511.htm' (May 11, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/909832/000090983224000049/cost-20240901.htm' (September 1, 2024)]

---
**Synthesis:**
Costco scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its powerful, durable business model and disciplined management team. The company's strongest positives are its deep-rooted competitive advantages, including the membership model and Kirkland Signature brand, its outstanding personnel relations, and its robust financial health. The only "No" is for R&D effectiveness, a point that fits awkwardly with Costco's retail model; the lack of specific metrics makes the criterion difficult to confirm, though innovation is clearly present in its business processes. Over the next 12-24 months, the score could be influenced by the pace of international expansion, particularly in newer markets like China, and the continued growth of its e-commerce channel. A sustained acceleration in international comparable sales and a successful expansion of online grocery or other digital services would reinforce its long-term growth runway. The "No" on R&D could flip to "Yes" if the company began disclosing metrics on its investments in supply chain technology or merchandising analytics that could be benchmarked against peers.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
