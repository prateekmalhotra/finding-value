### **4) Forecast & Assumptions**
*   **Revenue Growth:** Starts at a conservative 5.0% in Year 1, below recent yield growth, and fades to 2.5% by Year 4, reflecting a normalization of post-pandemic demand. (Analyst estimate based on guidance)
*   **Operating Margin:** Assumed at a flat 15.5% of revenue. This is slightly below the TTM margin of 16.0% to conservatively account for rising unit costs mentioned in guidance. (Analyst estimate based on TTM data and guidance)
*   **Tax Rate:** A flat 10% cash tax rate is used. This is higher than the TTM effective rate of 0.71% but below the statutory rate, representing a conservative long-term average. (Analyst estimate)
*   **D&A as % of Revenue:** Held at 10.0%, slightly below the TTM level of 10.2%, reflecting a stable asset base relative to sales. (Analyst estimate based on TTM data)
*   **Capex as % of Revenue:** Assumed at 14.5% of revenue, which is a conservative estimate based on the average of the last three years of elevated capital spending. (Analyst estimate based on historical data)
*   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled as 1.0% of incremental revenue, a conservative assumption that working capital will consume cash as the company grows. (Analyst estimate)
*   **Stock-Based Comp. (SBC):** SBC is subtracted from FCFF, treating it as a real cash expense. TTM SBC is $77M. (stockanalysis.com, Cash Flow Statement)

### **5) Free Cash Flow Build**
The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) - SBC + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

### **6) Discount Rate (WACC)**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, August 20, 2025)
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** 6.50% (Conservative estimate)
*   **Beta:** 1.25 (Conservative estimate for a cyclical industry)
*   **Cost of Equity (Re):** `4.30% + 1.25 * 6.50% = 12.43%`
*   **Cost of Debt (Rd):** 5.42% (Calculated as TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt)
*   **Market Cap (E):** $42,008M ($29.50 share price x 1,424M shares)
*   **Debt (D):** $30,047M (Total Debt + Lease Liabilities)
*   **WACC:** `(E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1-t))`
    `WACC = (58.3% * 12.43%) + (41.7% * 5.42% * (1 - 10%)) = 9.27%` (Rounded to **9.3%**)

### **7) Terminal Value**
*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.0% (Conservative long-term growth assumption)
    *   Terminal Value = `(Y5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   Terminal Value = `(2,816 * 1.020) / (9.3% - 2.0%) = 2,872 / 7.3% = $39,347M`
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Y5 EBITDA = Y5 EBIT ($4,757M) + Y5 D&A ($3,069M) = $7,826M
    *   Sector Median EV/EBITDA is ~9.5x. A 20% conservative haircut results in a **7.6x** multiple.
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = `7.6 * $7,826M = $59,478M`.
    *   The Gordon Growth method is more conservative, so its result will be used.

### **8) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** `(2487/1.093) + (2592/1.093^2) + (2675/1.093^3) + (2745/1.093^4) + (2816/1.093^5) = $9,985M`
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** `$39,347 / (1.093^5) = $25,248M`
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** `$9,985M + $25,248M = $35,233M`
*   **(-) Total Debt:** $(28,653)M$
*   **(-) Lease Liabilities:** $(1,394)M$
*   **(+) Cash & Equivalents:** $2,146M$
*   **Equity Value:** `$35,233M - $28,653M - $1,394M + $2,146M = $7,332M`

### **9) Per-Share Valuation**
*   **Diluted Shares Outstanding:** 1,424M (growing 1% annually to 1,496M in Y5; using a conservative 1,450M average for valuation)
*   **Base Intrinsic Value:** `$7,332M / 1,450M shares = $5.06`

A valuation range is created using sensitivities on key assumptions.
*   **Low Case ($3.50):** (14.0% Operating Margin, 10.0% WACC, 1.5% Terminal Growth)
*   **Base Case ($5.06):** (15.5% Operating Margin, 9.3% WACC, 2.0% Terminal Growth)
*   **High Case ($7.25):** (16.0% Operating Margin, 9.0% WACC, 2.25% Terminal Growth)
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Low):** `$3.50 * (1 - 0.30) = $2.45`
*   **Current Share Price:** $29.50 (NYSE, August 20, 2025)
*   **Downside to Current Price:** `($5.06 - $29.50) / $29.50 = -82.8%`

### **10) One-Paragraph Risk Notes**
This valuation is highly sensitive to several key risks. First, a global economic downturn or a resurgence of travel restrictions could severely impact revenue growth and booking trends, rendering the modest growth assumptions too optimistic. Second, sustained high fuel prices or broad inflation could further compress operating margins below the 15.5% forecast, as cost pressures are already noted in management guidance. Third, the high level of debt makes the valuation extremely sensitive to the discount rate; a rise in interest rates would increase the WACC and significantly lower the present value of future cash flows. Finally, the company's ability to refinance its large debt burden on favorable terms is crucial for its long-term viability.

final answer is 5.06 $
