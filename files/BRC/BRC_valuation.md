Key guidance was extracted from the Q3 2025 earnings call on May 16, 2025.

*   **Fiscal 2025 Revenue Growth:** "We now expect organic revenue growth to be in the low-single digits for the full fiscal year."
*   **Fiscal 2025 EPS:** "We are increasing our full-year EPS guidance to a range of $4.25 to $4.45 per share."
*   **Tax Rate:** "We continue to anticipate a tax rate of approximately 22% for the full fiscal year 2025."
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Management commentary suggests capex will remain consistent with historical norms as a percentage of sales, focused on automation and new product development.

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1:** 2.5%. This is the midpoint of "low-single digits" guidance.
    *   **Years 2-5:** 3.0%. This reflects a slight improvement from the guided year, in line with historical performance and management's focus on innovation and market penetration.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **EBIT Margin:** 16.0%. This is the TTM EBIT margin (215.1 / 1343.3), kept stable as there was no explicit management guidance for margin expansion.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 22.0%, directly from management guidance.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** 2.9% of revenue. This is the TTM average (38.9 / 1343.3) and aligns with the historical trend.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** 5.0% of the change in revenue, based on historical averages.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** 1.2% of revenue, in line with the TTM average (15.5 / 1343.3).
    *   **Diluted Shares:** 48.9 million, using the latest reported figure.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

*   **FCFF Formula:** `EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**
| Year | 1 (2026) | 2 (2027) | 3 (2028) | 4 (2029) | 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,376.9 | $1,418.2 | $1,460.7 | $1,504.6 | $1,549.7 |
| EBIT | $220.3 | $226.9 | $233.7 | $240.7 | $248.0 |
| NOPAT | $171.8 | $177.0 | $182.3 | $187.8 | $193.4 |
| D&A | $46.2 | $47.5 | $48.9 | $50.3 | $51.8 |
| SBC | ($16.5) | ($17.0) | ($17.5) | ($18.1) | ($18.6) |
| Capex | ($39.9) | ($41.1) | ($42.4) | ($43.6) | ($44.9) |
| Chg in WC | ($1.7) | ($2.1) | ($2.1) | ($2.2) | ($2.3) |
| **FCFF** | **$159.9** | **$164.3** | **$169.2** | **$174.2** | **$179.4** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0%. A standard premium for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta:** 0.95. Sourced from financial data providers (e.g., Yahoo Finance) for a 5-year period. A beta close to 1.0 reflects a company with market-level systematic risk, which is reasonable for an established industrial firm like Brady.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 0.95 * 5.0% = 9.00%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   The effective interest rate is calculated as TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $5.9M / $124.9M = 4.72%.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.72% * (1 - 22.0%) = 3.68%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity = $64.75 (share price) * 48.9M (shares) = $3,166.3M.
    *   Market Value of Debt = $124.9M.
    *   **WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1-t)**
    *   **WACC = ($3166.3 / $3291.2) * 9.00% + ($124.9 / $3291.2) * 3.68% = 8.79%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate (g) of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term sustainable economic growth and inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   **Terminal Value = ($179.4 * (1 + 2.5%)) / (8.79% - 2.5%) = $2,927.9M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $248.0M + $51.8M = $299.8M.
    *   BRC has historically traded at an EV/EBITDA multiple between 8x and 12x. A median multiple of 10x is appropriate.
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $299.8M * 10.0 = $2,998.0M.
    *   The Gordon Growth result is slightly more conservative and will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Present Value of FCFF (Years 1-5):** $680.5M (discounted at 8.79%)
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $1,929.3M (discounted at 8.79%)
*   **Enterprise Value (EV) = $680.5M + $1,929.3M = $2,609.8M**
*   **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $124.9M - $171.1M = -$46.2M**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt = $2,609.8M - (-$46.2M) = $2,656.0M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $2,656.0M / 48.9M = $54.32 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $54.32.** Assumes guided low-single-digit growth normalizing to 3.0% with stable margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $42.15.** Assumes 1% revenue growth, 100 bps of margin compression to 15.0%, and a higher WACC of 9.5%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $68.50.** Assumes 4.5% revenue growth, 50 bps of margin expansion to 16.5% from successful new product launches, and a lower WACC of 8.25%.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors.
    *   **MOS Price = $54.32 * (1 - 25%) = $40.74**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Economic Cyclicality:** As a supplier to industrial and manufacturing sectors, Brady's performance is sensitive to broader economic downturns which could reduce customer spending and organic growth below expectations.
2.  **Input Cost Volatility:** The business is exposed to fluctuations in raw material costs. While pricing power has been strong, a spike in costs could compress gross margins if not passed on effectively.
3.  **Competition:** The industrial identification and safety market is competitive. Failure to innovate and differentiate products could lead to market share loss and pressure on pricing and margins.
4.  **Integration Risk:** Future growth may depend on acquisitions. The failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could disrupt operations and fail to deliver expected synergies.
