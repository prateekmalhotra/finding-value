**Synthesis**

Allegion scores very highly on the Fisher checklist, demonstrating strong fundamentals across all 15 points. The company's strengths lie in its well-established brands, strong market position, consistent profitability, and commitment to innovation. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12-24 months would be a significant downturn in the non-residential construction market, a failure to successfully integrate recent acquisitions, or a major misstep in its transition to electronic and cloud-based security solutions. To maintain its perfect score, Allegion will need to continue to execute on its product roadmap, effectively manage its supply chain, and demonstrate continued growth in its electronic and software-based offerings.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
