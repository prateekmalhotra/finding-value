Company, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025, Form 10-Q filed for the quarter ended June 28, 2025, and Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript dated May 23, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren's "Next Great Chapter: Accelerate" strategy targets long-term growth through several vectors. These include expanding in under-penetrated key cities and regions, particularly in Asia, and growing its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channels. The company is also focused on attracting and retaining high-value, younger consumers. For fiscal 2025, the company projects revenue to increase low-single-digits, building on a $6.6 billion revenue base in fiscal 2024, indicating management's confidence in sustained growth.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a commitment to evolving its product lines and brand perception. The strategy involves elevating the brand through premium pricing and refined product assortments, focusing on "core" timeless products while introducing new categories and concepts. The company's capital expenditures, projected at $275 million to $300 million for fiscal 2025, are directed at supporting growth through investments in technology and store build-outs, which are crucial for developing their DTC and digital presence.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For an apparel firm, "R&D" is better understood as design, brand development, and marketing innovation. Ralph Lauren does not disclose a formal R&D expense line item, which is typical for the industry. While the company's significant marketing spend (7.5% of revenue in Q1 2026) supports brand strength, there are no specific, quantifiable metrics available in public filings to assess the effectiveness or productivity of these efforts relative to peers. Without clear output metrics, it is not possible to verify above-average effectiveness.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is executing a strategic shift towards higher-margin DTC sales, which grew 6% in fiscal 2025's first quarter. This channel now represents approximately two-thirds of total revenue. This focus on its own retail stores and digital commerce platform allows for greater control over brand presentation and customer relationships. The continued growth in this channel, coupled with a deliberate reduction in lower-quality wholesale distribution, indicates a strong and strategically-aligned sales effort.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Ralph Lauren maintains strong profit margins for its industry. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026 (ended June 28, 2025), the adjusted gross margin was 66.5%, and the adjusted operating margin was 11.0%. For the full fiscal year 2025, the company reported a gross margin of 66.7% and an operating margin of 13.1%. These figures are competitive within the premium apparel and luxury goods sector.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000018/rl-20250628.htm'] (Filed August 7, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm'] (Filed May 23, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin enhancement through several key initiatives. These include: elevating the brand to support higher average unit retail (AUR) and pricing power, strategically shifting the sales mix toward the more profitable DTC channel, and maintaining disciplined inventory management. In its Q1 2026 earnings release, the company noted that gross margin expansion was driven by lower freight costs and favorable channel mix, demonstrating execution of this strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's Form 10-K (filed May 23, 2025) describes its human capital strategy, focusing on attracting, developing, and retaining talent with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion. However, there is a lack of publicly disclosed, quantifiable data—such as employee turnover rates or engagement scores compared to industry benchmarks—to independently verify "outstanding" relations. While there are no reports of significant labor strife, the available information is insufficient to meet Fisher's high standard.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm'] (Filed May 23, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability, with Patrice Louvet serving as CEO since 2017 and founder Ralph Lauren remaining as Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, ensuring brand continuity. The long tenure of key executives suggests a stable and cohesive leadership environment. Succession planning is also addressed, with the promotion of senior leaders into expanded roles noted in company press releases.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren has a well-defined management structure with experienced leaders heading key regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) and functions (e.g., Chief Financial Officer, Chief Commercial Officer). The company's investor relations website and annual reports name these key individuals, indicating a bench of talent beyond the CEO. This structure suggests operational continuity and mitigates key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren's financial reporting is detailed, with clear segmentation for its three geographic regions (North America, Europe, Asia) and various channels. The auditor’s report from Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. There is no recent history of material restatements or significant control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator in the apparel industry is enduring brand equity. Ralph Lauren's iconic "Polo Pony" logo and its association with a timeless, aspirational American lifestyle give it a durable competitive advantage. The company’s ability to maintain brand relevance across generations, demonstrated by its successful attraction of younger consumers while retaining its core base, is a powerful asset that is difficult for competitors to replicate. This brand power enables premium pricing and customer loyalty.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's "Next Great Chapter: Accelerate" strategy is inherently long-term, focusing on brand elevation and strategic investments that may not maximize short-term profits. For instance, the deliberate reduction of off-price and wholesale accounts and increased marketing spend (up 19% in Q1 2026) are aimed at building long-term brand health, even if it pressures near-term sales or margins. This demonstrates a willingness to prioritize sustainable growth over immediate quarterly results.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong. As of June 28, 2025, Ralph Lauren had $1.6 billion in cash and short-term investments against $1.1 billion in total debt. The company consistently generates strong free cash flow and returns capital to shareholders via dividends and a share repurchase program ($400 million authorized for repurchase in fiscal 2025). This financial strength and capital allocation policy indicate no foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management communicates with investors regularly through detailed quarterly earnings calls and presentations. In their discussions, they address both positive performance and challenges, such as macroeconomic headwinds in specific regions or cost pressures. For example, in the Q1 2026 report, they openly discussed a 1% revenue decline in North America due to cautious consumer behavior, providing transparency on underperforming segments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000018/rl-20250628.htm'] (Filed August 7, 2025), ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/RL/transcripts/'] (Q4 2025 Earnings Call, May 23, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent SEC filings and major news outlets reveals no significant legal proceedings, regulatory actions, or scandals that would question the integrity of the senior management team. The company has a code of conduct, and its financial statements are audited by a reputable firm. There are no apparent governance red flags or related-party transactions that suggest a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm'] (Filed May 23, 2025)

Synthesis
Ralph Lauren scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its strong brand equity, consistent profitability, solid financial health, and a clear, long-term strategic vision under stable management. The company's strengths lie in its iconic brand, which enables pricing power and margin stability, and its disciplined execution of the "Next Great Chapter" plan, particularly the successful shift towards a higher-margin DTC model. The primary weaknesses in this analysis stem from a lack of specific, publicly available data to definitively prove "outstanding" performance in R&D effectiveness and personnel relations, forcing a "No" under Fisher's strict criteria. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's performance in Asia, as success in this growth market is critical to the "long runway" thesis. A sustained downturn in discretionary consumer spending could also pressure margins and sales, potentially changing the answers for points 5 and 6. To flip the "No" on R&D, the company would need to disclose metrics linking marketing and design investments to market share gains or customer value. For personnel relations, disclosing industry-leading employee retention rates would provide the necessary evidence.

fisher score is 13 / 15
