### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Resumption of Share Repurchases
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Charter has historically been an aggressive repurchaser of its own stock. As of September 30, 2024, the company had $599 million remaining on its board authorization for share buybacks.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** Earliest possible date: Immediately. Latest plausible date: Within the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Charter utilizes 50% of its remaining authorization, repurchasing approximately $300 million in stock.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Charter fully utilizes its remaining $599 million authorization.
    *   **High Scenario:** Charter utilizes the remaining authorization and the board authorizes a new, larger repurchase program.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-15%. This is a conservative estimate based on the size of the remaining authorization relative to the company's market capitalization.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has a long history of share repurchases, and with the stock price well off its highs, management is likely to see value in buying back shares.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Free cash flow generation must remain strong to fund the buybacks. The company must also remain in compliance with its debt covenants.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports (10-Q) for "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
    *   Press releases announcing new or expanded share repurchase authorizations.
    *   Free cash flow generation reported in quarterly earnings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business could reduce free cash flow and halt buybacks.
    *   The company may choose to prioritize debt reduction over share repurchases.
    *   Increased capital expenditures for the rural buildout or network evolution could consume cash that would otherwise be used for buybacks.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the company's quarterly reports for evidence of buyback activity.

**2. Catalyst Title:** "Life Unlimited" Pricing & Packaging Strategy
*   **Type:** Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In September 2024, Charter launched a new brand platform, "Life Unlimited," which includes a simplified pricing and packaging strategy. This strategy is designed to offer lower promotional and persistent bundled pricing to drive customer and financial growth.
*   **Mechanism:** The new pricing strategy is intended to increase customer acquisition and retention, leading to higher revenue and EBITDA. By offering more value in bundled packages, Charter hopes to increase the number of products per customer, which is a key driver of profitability.
*   **Timing:** The strategy was launched in September 2024, so the impact should be seen over the next 0-12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The new strategy has a minimal impact on customer trends, with continued modest net losses in internet subscribers.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The strategy helps to stabilize the internet subscriber base and leads to a modest increase in revenue per customer.
    *   **High Scenario:** The strategy is highly successful, leading to a return to internet subscriber growth and a significant increase in revenue per customer.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-15%. A return to subscriber growth would be a significant positive for the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The strategy has already been launched, so the key uncertainty is its effectiveness.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The success of this strategy depends on the competitive environment and consumer reception.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports for internet, video, and mobile subscriber net additions.
    *   Quarterly reports for residential and SMB revenue per customer.
    *   Management commentary on the success of the new strategy during earnings calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Competitors could respond with their own aggressive pricing, negating Charter's strategy.
    *   Consumers may not find the new bundles attractive.
    *   The strategy could lead to a decrease in average revenue per user (ARPU) if customers opt for lower-priced packages.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Closely monitor the next few quarterly earnings reports for signs of a positive inflection in subscriber trends.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Subsidized Rural Construction Initiative
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Charter is expanding its network to over 1.7 million unserved homes and businesses, partially funded by over $2 billion in government subsidies. The company spent $2.2 billion on this initiative in 2024 and activated approximately 393,000 new passings.
*   **Mechanism:** This initiative expands Charter's footprint into unserved, and therefore uncontested, markets. This will be a key driver of subscriber growth for the next several years. The government subsidies reduce the capital intensity of the buildout, improving the return on investment.
*   **Timing:** This is a multi-year initiative that is already underway and is expected to continue for the next several years.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Charter achieves a 30% penetration rate in the new build areas.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Charter achieves a 40% penetration rate, in line with its historical average in new build areas.
    *   **High Scenario:** Charter achieves a 50% or higher penetration rate due to the lack of competition in these areas.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-25%. This is a significant long-term growth driver for the company.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company is already well underway with this initiative and has secured the necessary funding.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The successful and timely execution of the buildout is dependent on external factors like utility pole permitting and make-ready processes.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports for capital expenditures related to the rural buildout.
    *   Quarterly reports for new passings activated.
    *   Management commentary on the penetration rates in the new build areas.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Delays in the buildout could push back the expected subscriber growth.
    *   The cost of the buildout could be higher than expected.
    *   The take rates in the new areas could be lower than anticipated.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is a clear, long-term growth catalyst for the company.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Liberty Broadband Combination
*   **Type:** M&A
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On November 12, 2024, Charter and Liberty Broadband entered into a merger agreement for Charter to acquire Liberty Broadband. This transaction is expected to close on June 30, 2027.
*   **Mechanism:** This merger will simplify Charter's ownership structure and eliminate the overhang from a large, motivated seller. It will also give Charter more control over its own stock, as Liberty Broadband will no longer be a separate publicly traded entity with its own shareholders and strategic priorities.
*   **Timing:** The transaction is expected to close on June 30, 2027.
*   **Quantification:** The impact of this transaction is difficult to quantify, but it should be a net positive for the stock over the long term.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%. The simplification of the ownership structure should be a modest positive for the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The deal has been announced and is subject to customary closing conditions.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Press releases and SEC filings related to the merger.
    *   Any announcements from regulatory bodies regarding the merger.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The deal could be blocked by regulators.
    *   The terms of the deal could be changed.
    *   The deal could be terminated by either party.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the progress of the merger through regulatory and shareholder approvals.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Resumption of Share Repurchases:**
*   **Assumptions:** Charter repurchases $599 million of stock at an average price of $300/share. This would retire approximately 2 million shares.
*   **Formula:** (Net Income / (Current Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) \* P/E Multiple = Implied Share Price
*   **Citation:** As of September 30, 2024, Charter had 142,195,750 shares of Class A common stock outstanding.
*   **Sensitivity:** A 2 million share reduction in the share count would increase EPS by approximately 1.4%. Assuming a constant P/E multiple, this would translate to a 1.4% increase in the share price.

**2. Subsidized Rural Construction Initiative:**
*   **Assumptions:** Charter adds 1.7 million new passings over the next 5 years and achieves a 40% penetration rate. This would result in 680,000 new subscribers. Assuming an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $120/month, this would add approximately $979 million in annual revenue.
*   **Formula:** (New Passings \* Penetration Rate \* ARPU \* 12) \* Revenue Multiple = Implied Value Creation
*   **Citation:** The company expects to expand its network to over 1.7 million passings.
*   **Sensitivity:** At a 4x revenue multiple, the rural buildout would create approximately $3.9 billion in value, or about $27 per share.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for Charter is positive. The new pricing and packaging strategy, combined with the resumption of share buybacks, could lead to a positive inflection in the company's stock price over the next 0-12 months. The key to this will be a stabilization of the company's internet subscriber trends.

### **9) Evidence Matrix**

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Intensified Competition:** Increased competition from fiber and fixed wireless providers could lead to continued internet subscriber losses, negating the impact of the new pricing strategy.
2.  **Economic Downturn:** A recession could lead to a slowdown in new household formation and an increase in bad debt, both of which would negatively impact Charter's business.
3.  **Regulatory Headwinds:** New regulations, such as price controls or net neutrality rules, could negatively impact Charter's profitability.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

The near-term outlook for Charter is positive, with the new "Life Unlimited" pricing strategy and the resumption of share repurchases as key catalysts. We see a potential upside of 10-20% over the next 12 months. The single most important indicator to monitor is the company's quarterly internet subscriber net additions.
