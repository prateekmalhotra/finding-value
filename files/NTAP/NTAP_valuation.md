### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD millions) | **Year 1 (2026E)** | **Year 2 (2027E)** | **Year 3 (2028E)** | **Year 4 (2029E)** | **Year 5 (2030E)** |

| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.3% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 21, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.0% | Standard market premium for a mature market. |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Calculation & Result |
| --- | --- |
| **Gordon Growth** | `TV = [FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)`<br>`TV = [$826 * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.101 - 0.025)`<br>**`TV = $11,141M`** |
| *Assumption: Terminal Growth (g)* | *2.5% (Long-run inflation expectation)* |
| **Exit Multiple (Cross-Check)** | `TV = EBITDA_Y5 * Median Multiple`<br>EBITDA Y5 = EBIT Y5 + D&A Y5 = $1,461M + $241M = $1,702M<br>`TV = $1,702M * 10.7x`<br>**`TV = $18,211M`** |
| *Assumption: Exit Multiple* | *10.7x (10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple).* |

*Decision:* There is a significant discrepancy between the two methods. As per the valuation framework, the more conservative **Gordon Growth terminal value of $11,141M** will be used.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The data storage industry is intensely competitive, with pressure from larger public cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) and other hardware vendors, which could impact future growth and pricing power.
2.  **Technological Disruption:** A failure to innovate and adapt to new technologies, such as emerging AI data pipelines and next-generation storage media, could render NetApp's product portfolio less competitive.
3.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As an enterprise hardware and software provider, NetApp's sales are sensitive to corporate IT spending, which can be cyclical and is vulnerable to economic downturns.
4.  **Supply Chain Risk:** The company relies on a global supply chain for its hardware components. Disruptions could lead to delays, increased costs, and an inability to meet customer demand.
