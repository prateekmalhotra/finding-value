### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo operates in the large and growing global snacks and beverages markets. The company is actively managing its portfolio to align with consumer trends, such as health and wellness, by reducing added sugars, sodium, and saturated fat. Recent acquisitions like Siete (Mexican-American foods) and Poppi (prebiotic soda) in early 2025 demonstrate a strategy to enter high-growth categories. International markets, which generated 44% of revenue in 2024, offer significant expansion potential, particularly in developing and emerging economies.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment is evident through its "pep+" (PepsiCo Positive) strategy, which guides its portfolio transformation. The company invests in innovation to evolve its recipes, develop new products, and acquire brands in growth areas. Research and development activities are global, with centers in the U.S., Mexico, China, and Europe, focusing on new ingredients, packaging technology, and manufacturing process improvements. The recent acquisitions of Siete and Poppi underscore a commitment to expanding into new, high-potential market segments.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While PepsiCo does not disclose a single R&D expense figure, its innovation is demonstrated through consistent product launches and strategic portfolio shifts. The company's R&D efforts are focused on key consumer trends, including health and wellness and sustainability, such as developing and improving products to reduce sugar, sodium, and fat. The effectiveness is shown by the successful integration of new brands and the continuous adaptation of its 28 billion-dollar brands to meet changing consumer preferences. The company's global research centers support this effort by leveraging consumer insights and food science to drive innovation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo possesses a world-class sales and distribution network. A key competitive advantage is its Direct Store Delivery (DSD) system, which delivers products directly to retail stores, enabling better merchandising and product freshness. This is complemented by customer warehouse and third-party distributor networks, allowing it to service a wide range of customers from large merchandisers to small foodservice outlets. In 2024, sales to Walmart alone represented approximately 14% of consolidated net revenue, demonstrating the strength of its relationship with key retailers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo consistently maintains strong profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, the company reported a gross margin of 54.5% ($50,110 million gross profit on $91,854 million net revenue) and an operating margin of 14.0% ($12,887 million operating profit). For the 24 weeks ended June 14, 2025, the operating margin was 10.8%. These margins are robust for the food and beverage industry, reflecting the company's pricing power, brand loyalty, and scale efficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000044/pep-20250614.htm' (July 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo is actively engaged in programs to protect and enhance margins. The "2019 Productivity Plan," extended through 2030, focuses on automating processes, optimizing the supply chain, and simplifying the organization. Management cites "effective net pricing" and "productivity savings" as key drivers of operating profit. The company also uses fixed-price contracts and derivatives to manage volatility in commodity costs for key inputs like corn, sugar, and aluminum.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000044/pep-20250614.htm' (July 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 28, 2024, PepsiCo employed approximately 319,000 people worldwide, with many covered by collective bargaining agreements. The company states that "relations with our employees are generally good." It has invested in safety technology like fleet telematics and offers training and development programs such as PEP U Degreed. While large global companies inevitably face some labor disputes, there is no evidence of widespread, systemic labor problems that would materially harm the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a deep bench of long-tenured leaders promoted from within. Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta has been with the company since 1996 and became CEO in 2018. Other key executives, such as James Caulfield (CFO) and Eugene Willemsen (CEO, International Franchise Beverages), have decades of experience at PepsiCo. This stability suggests a cohesive and effective leadership team with a consistent long-term vision.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo has a clear and deep management structure, with experienced CEOs for each major division, such as North America, Latin America Foods, and EMEA. The company's practice of promoting from within and providing executives with diverse experiences across different geographies and business units ensures a strong pipeline of talent. The detailed biographies of executive officers in the 2024 10-K highlight extensive careers within PepsiCo, indicating a well-developed succession planning process.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo's financial reporting provides detailed segment data, allowing for clear analysis of performance across its seven (now six, post-reorganization) divisions. The 2024 Annual Report includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm attesting to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The company has a consistent history of detailed financial disclosure and has had no major restatements, indicating robust accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000044/pep-20250614.htm' (July 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo's key competitive advantage lies in its dual-engine business of convenient foods and beverages, creating a unique portfolio that competitors like Coca-Cola lack. This diversification provides resilience and cross-promotional opportunities. A second crucial advantage is its sophisticated distribution network, especially the DSD system, which is a significant barrier to entry and allows for superior in-store execution and merchandising. This powerful combination of a complementary portfolio and a best-in-class distribution network sets it apart.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's pep+ strategy is inherently long-term, focusing on sustainable growth by transforming its portfolio, supply chain, and agricultural sourcing. Investments in this strategy, such as developing sustainable packaging and reformulating products, prioritize long-term brand health over short-term margin optimization. The extension of its productivity plan to 2030 and its continued pace of acquisitions in emerging categories further demonstrate a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000044/pep-20250614.htm' (July 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PepsiCo's financial position is exceptionally strong. For the 24 weeks ended June 14, 2025, the company generated nearly $1.0 billion in cash from operations. It maintains a consistent policy of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, repurchasing $1.0 billion of stock in 2024 and planning another $1.0 billion in repurchases for 2025. With a strong balance sheet and access to debt markets (issuing $3.5 billion in long-term debt in the first half of 2025), there is no indication it would need to issue equity for growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000044/pep-20250614.htm' (July 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed discussions of business risks and challenges in its SEC filings. The MD&A section of the 10-K and 10-Q filings openly discusses headwinds like commodity cost inflation, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, geopolitical conditions, and impairment charges. For example, the filings clearly detail the financial impact of the Quaker Recall and the $1.9 billion impairment charge related to the Rockstar and Be & Cheery brands in Q2 2025, demonstrating transparency about negative events.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000044/pep-20250614.htm' (July 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no widespread or recent indicators of significant integrity issues with senior management. The company has a compliance and ethics program, and the Board's Audit Committee oversees compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. While a company of this scale is party to various legal proceedings, such as recent lawsuits regarding plastic pollution, these appear to be industry-wide challenges rather than evidence of executive malfeasance. There are no reported SEC investigations into executive conduct or major accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/77476/000007747625000007/pep-20241228.htm' (February 2025)]

---
**Synthesis:**
PepsiCo scores exceptionally well on Fisher's 15 points, reflecting its status as a blue-chip global leader. The company's strongest positives are its diversified and resilient portfolio of iconic brands, its formidable global distribution network, and a stable, experienced management team with a clear long-term strategy (pep+). The primary variables that could change this score in the next 12–24 months are related to execution and external pressures. A significant factor will be the success of recent acquisitions like Poppi and Siete and the ability to continue innovating in the health and wellness space to drive organic volume growth, which has shown some weakness. Another variable is the impact of ongoing inflationary pressures and geopolitical instability on margins and international performance. Finally, increasing regulatory scrutiny on plastics and "unhealthy" foods could pose a long-term headwind, and any failure to navigate this landscape effectively could alter the analysis.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
