Company: Wolverine World Wide, Inc. (WWW)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024; Q1 2025 Earnings Report (May 8, 2025); Q2 2025 Earnings Report (August 6, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's portfolio is increasingly focused on its "Active Group," composed of the Merrell, Saucony, Sweaty Betty, and Chaco brands, which competes in the growing outdoor and performance footwear sector. Recent results show this strategy is gaining traction, with the Active Group driving strong double-digit growth, led by Saucony (41.5% revenue growth in Q2 2025) and Merrell (10.7% growth). This growth contrasts with declines in the "Work Group," indicating management is successfully pivoting to higher-potential consumer segments. The company is also expanding internationally, with sales outside the U.S. accounting for 49.1% of revenue in fiscal 2024, providing a large addressable market for its key brands.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has explicitly stated its strategy is to "build and grow high-energy footwear, apparel and accessories brands that inspire and empower consumers." To do this, it is divesting non-core assets like Keds and Sperry while investing in its growth brands. Evidence of this commitment includes Saucony's award-winning technologies like INCREDIRun foam and SPEEDROLL Technology, and Merrell's focus on innovation in hiking and trail running. Recent earnings commentary emphasizes a new "brand-building model" focused on consumer value and product innovation rather than promotion, which is a clear commitment to developing durable product lines. The company is also actively licensing its brands for non-footwear products, such as Hush Puppies apparel and Wolverine eyewear, to extend brand reach.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company does not disclose specific R&D expenditures, which are included within "Selling, general and administrative expenses." However, effectiveness can be inferred from the success of new products and technologies. The 10-K highlights proprietary technologies for its core brands, such as Saucony's award-winning foams and Merrell's performance designs, as a primary competitive advantage. The strong growth in Saucony (41.5% in Q2 2025) and Merrell (10.7%) suggests that their product development is resonating with consumers and driving market share gains. This demonstrates effective output from their development process, even without a specific spending figure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wolverine World Wide utilizes a diversified, multi-channel sales approach, including wholesale to department stores and specialty retailers, direct-to-consumer (DTC) e-commerce sites, and 119 retail stores. The company also has a global reach, marketing products in approximately 170 countries and territories through owned operations, third-party distributors, and licensees. The recent revenue growth in key brands like Merrell and Saucony, which drove an 11.5% total revenue increase in Q2 2025, indicates the sales organization is effectively executing in its target markets. The international business grew 15.7% in Q2 2025, showing strength in its global distribution network.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a dramatic improvement in profitability. Gross margin for fiscal year 2024 improved to 44.5% from 38.9% in 2023. This trend has accelerated in 2025, with gross margin reaching a record 47.3% in Q1 and 47.2% in Q2. This recent margin profile is very strong for the footwear industry and reflects management's successful shift away from promotional sales toward higher-value products. The Q2 2025 operating margin was approximately 6.7% on a reported basis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is executing a clear strategy to improve margins. Key actions include divesting lower-margin brands (Keds, Sperry) to focus on the higher-margin Active Group. Recent earnings reports explicitly credit margin expansion to a healthier sales mix, reduced promotional activity, and supply chain cost initiatives. The company is also diversifying its supply chain away from China to mitigate tariff risks and control costs, with a goal to reduce reliance to less than 10% by 2026.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K describes a human capital strategy focused on attracting, developing, and retaining talent through competitive compensation and benefits, leadership development programs, and inclusion initiatives. It highlights amenities at its corporate headquarters such as a fitness center and child care. However, there is no specific, verifiable data provided (like employee turnover rates or engagement scores) to objectively assess whether relations are "outstanding" relative to peers. Without quantitative metrics or significant positive third-party reporting, it is difficult to confirm this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant recent turnover in its executive ranks. Christopher Hufnagel was appointed President and CEO in August 2023, Taryn Miller was appointed CFO in May 2024, and Susan Kuhn became President of the Active Group in October 2024. While a new team can bring positive change, this level of recent change at the highest levels suggests a period of instability rather than long-term, settled relations. It is too early to assess the long-term effectiveness and cohesion of the new leadership team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K lists a team of six named executive officers, including the CEO, CFO, CHRO, Chief Legal Officer, and Presidents for the Active Group and International. This structure shows clear leadership for key functions and business units. The recent appointments of a new CFO and a President for the Active group from outside companies (Corteva, Kimberly-Clark, and Foot Locker) suggest the board is willing to bring in external talent for key roles, which can enhance depth. However, the recent and significant turnover at the top levels creates uncertainty about the stability and depth of the management bench below the named executive level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, which attests to the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. Management's report on internal control also concluded it was effective. The company provides segment reporting that breaks down revenue and operating profit for its Active and Work groups, allowing for cost and profitability analysis at the segment level. The recent success in improving gross margins and reducing inventory and debt points to effective financial controls and analysis being applied to the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the branded footwear and apparel industry, brand strength and channel management are key differentiators. Wolverine's successful pivot to focus on Merrell and Saucony, which command brand loyalty in the growth categories of outdoor and running, is a significant positive clue. The company's ability to drive a 410 basis point improvement in gross margin (Q2 2025) in a competitive market indicates strong pricing power and brand equity. Furthermore, the company's advanced supply chain diversification, aiming for under 10% reliance on China by 2026, is a key competitive advantage in an industry exposed to geopolitical and tariff risks.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent strategic actions provide strong evidence of a long-range outlook. Management undertook a significant transformation, divesting established brands like Sperry and Keds and absorbing the associated short-term revenue loss and restructuring costs. This was done to reposition the portfolio around the higher-growth Merrell and Saucony brands, a strategy that is now driving profitable growth. This willingness to transform the portfolio for future gain, rather than maximizing short-term revenue from legacy brands, is a hallmark of a long-range view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position has strengthened considerably. Cash flow from operating activities was $180.1 million in fiscal 2024. The company has been actively using cash from operations and asset sales to reduce debt, with net debt falling by 14.8% year-over-year in Q2 2025 to $568 million. Inventory was also down 23.6% in Q1 2025, freeing up working capital. With a $150 million stock repurchase program authorized in March 2024 and no shares repurchased, the company is clearly not planning to issue equity and has the authorization to be opportunistic in reducing share count.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a consistent history of hosting quarterly earnings calls. A key test of candor is how management communicates uncertainty. In its Q1 2025 earnings release, the company explicitly withdrew its full-year guidance, stating it was "due to uncertainty around tariffs and related macro-economic conditions." While some may see this negatively, it is also a sign of transparency, as management is openly communicating the risks it faces rather than maintaining guidance it may not be confident in achieving. This shows a willingness to be direct about challenges.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** (August 6, 2025). (May 8, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s 2024 10-K details significant litigation and environmental liabilities related to PFAS contamination from a former tannery, with total remediation reserves of $39.7 million as of December 28, 2024. The company entered into a consent decree in February 2020 to resolve a civil action, agreeing to fund the extension of municipal water systems for over 1,000 properties. While these issues stem from past operations, the ongoing legal and environmental proceedings represent a significant legacy issue that complicates an assessment of "unquestionable integrity." The issues are material and have required costly settlements and remediation efforts.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm) (February 22, 2025).

**Synthesis**

Wolverine World Wide is in the midst of a successful, albeit challenging, strategic turnaround. The analysis reveals a strong positive trajectory driven by a renewed focus on its high-growth Active Group brands, Merrell and Saucony. This pivot is yielding impressive results, including strong revenue growth in these core brands, record gross margins, and a strengthening balance sheet with lower debt and inventory. The primary variables that will likely change the score in the next 12-24 months are the stability and long-term effectiveness of the new executive team and continued progress in mitigating the legacy environmental issues. A "No" on management depth could flip to "Yes" with a year of stable leadership and demonstrated success in executing the strategy. Similarly, continued progress in resolving PFAS-related liabilities without major new adverse findings could eventually allow for a re-evaluation of the integrity score.
