### 1) Network Effects

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan’s products do not exhibit strong network effects. While a large user base is beneficial, the marginal utility of adding new users does not significantly increase the value for existing users. The company's solutions are primarily focused on security and authentication, which are self-contained and do not rely on a growing user network for increased functionality or value.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's business model is based on selling security solutions to enterprises, not on creating a user-to-user network. The value proposition is in the security features of the products themselves, not in the number of users on the platform. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
*   OneSpan operates in a competitive market where customers choose solutions based on features, security, and price, not on the size of the user base. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan benefits from moderate switching costs, particularly in its Security Solutions segment. The integration of OneSpan's authentication and security software into a customer's IT infrastructure and applications creates a technical lock-in. Migrating to a competitor's solution would require significant time, resources, and effort, creating a deterrent for customers.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's Security Solutions consist of a broad portfolio of software products, software development kits (SDKs), and Digipass authenticator devices that are used to build applications designed to defend against attacks on digital transactions across online environments, devices, and applications. This deep integration makes it difficult for customers to switch to a competitor. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
*   Net retention rate was 107% at March 31, 2025, indicating that existing customers are not only staying but also expanding their use of OneSpan's platform. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-Q, May 1, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan does not have a demonstrable cost advantage over its peers. The company's hardware business, in particular, is subject to supply chain disruptions and component shortages, which can lead to increased costs. The company's gross margins are in line with the industry, suggesting that it does not have a significant cost advantage.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company’s Digipass authentication devices are manufactured by third-party manufacturers in China and Romania, which exposes the company to supply chain risks and potential cost increases. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
*   Gross margin was 74% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, which is not indicative of a significant cost advantage over competitors. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-Q, May 1, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan possesses a portfolio of patents and trademarks that provide a degree of protection for its technology. However, the company operates in a rapidly evolving market where patents alone do not guarantee a sustainable competitive advantage. The company has also acknowledged that its brand recognition is not as strong as some of its competitors.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company holds patents in the U.S. and in other countries, which cover multiple aspects of its technology. These patents expire between 2026 and 2040. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
*   The company has registrations for most of its trademarks in most of the markets where it sells the corresponding products and services. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
*   The company believes that enhancing its brand recognition is important to its efforts to attract new customers and channel partners, and that its relative lack of brand awareness has made it more challenging to acquire new customers. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan has a global sales and distribution network, which allows it to reach a broad customer base. However, the company does not have exclusive distribution channels or a physical network that would be difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's market is global and accessible to competitors with sufficient resources.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's solutions are sold worldwide through its direct sales force as well as through distributors, resellers, systems integrators, and original equipment manufacturers. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
*   The company's sales are geographically diverse, with 49% of revenue from EMEA, 33% from the Americas, and 18% from APAC in the three months ended March 31, 2025. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-Q, May 1, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan's business does not appear to be driven by a unique and hard-to-replicate dataset. While the company processes a large volume of transactions, it has not demonstrated that it is leveraging this data to create a significant competitive advantage. The company's products are primarily focused on security and authentication, not on data-driven insights.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's business is focused on providing security solutions, not on collecting and analyzing data for competitive advantage. The company's value proposition is in the security and reliability of its products, not in the data it processes. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan's products are not a platform in the traditional sense, and the company does not have a strong ecosystem of third-party developers or complementary products. The company's solutions are designed to be integrated into a customer's existing IT infrastructure, but they do not create a platform that attracts a large number of third-party developers.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company offers a software development kit (SDK) that allows customers to integrate its security features into their applications. However, this is not a broad platform that attracts a large number of third-party developers. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan operates in a regulated industry, and its products must comply with various security and data privacy regulations. This creates a barrier to entry for new competitors, as they would need to invest significant resources to ensure compliance. However, these regulations also apply to OneSpan's existing competitors, so it is not a unique advantage.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   As a global cybersecurity and e-signature company, OneSpan is subject to complex and evolving global regulations in the various jurisdictions in which its products and services are used. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
*   The company's products are used by customers in the banking and financial services industry, which is a highly regulated industry. This requires the company to maintain a high level of security and compliance. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan's business is not capital intensive, as the company outsources the manufacturing of its hardware products. The company's primary assets are its intellectual property and its software, which do not require a large amount of capital to maintain. This low capital intensity makes it easier for new competitors to enter the market.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's Digipass authentication devices are manufactured by third-party manufacturers, which reduces the company's capital expenditures. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility

**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** OneSpan has a significant portion of its revenue from recurring sources, which provides good revenue visibility. The company's subscription-based model and multi-year contracts provide a predictable stream of revenue.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) was $168.4 million at March 31, 2025, an increase of 9% from the prior year. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-Q, May 1, 2025).
*   The company's subscription revenue grew 7% in the Security Solutions segment and 13% in the Digital Agreements segment in the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-Q, May 1, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### Aggregation

**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(1 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 1.89

**Final Weighted Score:** 37.8 / 100

### Mapping

A weighted score of 37.8 falls within the 30-50 range, which corresponds to a moat rating of 2.

### Moat Duration Justification

The estimated moat duration is approximately 5-7 years. This is based on the moderate switching costs and the company's intellectual property portfolio. However, the company faces significant competition and a rapidly evolving technological landscape, which could erode its competitive advantages over the long term. The company's patents expire between 2026 and 2040, which could also impact its moat duration.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios

1.  **Increased Competition:** The market for security and authentication solutions is highly competitive, and OneSpan faces competition from larger and more well-established companies. Increased competition could lead to price pressure and a loss of market share. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
2.  **Technological Disruption:** The security industry is subject to rapid technological change. The emergence of new technologies could render OneSpan's products obsolete and erode its competitive position. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).
3.  **Loss of a Key Customer:** A significant portion of OneSpan's revenue comes from a limited number of customers. The loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial results. (OneSpan Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).

### KPIs to Monitor

*   **Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR):** A decline in ARR would indicate that the company is losing customers or that existing customers are spending less.
*   **Net Retention Rate (NRR):** A decline in NRR would indicate that the company is struggling to retain its existing customers.
*   **Gross Margin:** A decline in gross margin would indicate that the company is facing price pressure or that its costs are increasing.
*   **Customer Concentration:** An increase in customer concentration would increase the company's risk profile.
*   **R&D spending as a percentage of revenue:** A significant decrease in R&D spending could indicate that the company is not investing enough in innovation to keep up with the competition.

### Short Verdict Paragraph

OneSpan has a narrow moat based on moderate switching costs and a portfolio of intellectual property. The company's security solutions are deeply integrated into its customers' IT infrastructure, which makes it difficult for them to switch to a competitor. However, the company faces significant competition from larger and more well-established companies, and the security industry is subject to rapid technological change. A significant improvement in the company's brand recognition and the development of stronger network effects would be needed to justify a higher moat rating.

moat rating is 2 / 5
