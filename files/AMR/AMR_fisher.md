Company: Alpha Metallurgical Resources, Inc. (AMR)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024; DEF 14A Proxy Statement filed April 4, 2025; Wood Mackenzie Global Coal Market Outlook (August 20, 2024).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**  
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alpha Metallurgical's primary product, metallurgical (met) coal, is an essential input for blast furnace steelmaking. Global steel demand is expected to grow, particularly in India and Southeast Asia, which are key import markets. However, the long-term outlook is challenged by decarbonization efforts and the increasing adoption of alternative steelmaking technologies like electric arc furnaces and green steel. While demand for high-quality met coal will likely persist for some time, and supply of the highest grades may tighten, the overall market faces significant headwinds that make a "sizable increase" in sales over "several years" questionable.  
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a mining company, ongoing development focuses on bringing new reserves into production. AMR has demonstrated this commitment through recent and ongoing projects. In 2023, the company began production at its Rolling Thunder and Checkmate Powellton mines. More recently, in 2024, AMR started the development of the new Kingston Wildcat underground mine, which is expected to begin producing low-volatile met coal in late 2025. This consistent investment in new mine development shows a clear strategy to replace depleted reserves and maintain or grow production volumes.  
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a commodity producer, AMR does not engage in research and development in the traditional sense. The company's Form 10-K for 2024 makes no mention of specific R&D expenditures, personnel, or dedicated facilities. Innovation is focused on operational efficiencies and safety improvements in mining techniques rather than developing new products. While these efforts may improve costs, they do not align with Fisher's concept of an R&D effort that creates future growth engines.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMR operates a global sales network, with export revenues accounting for approximately 78% of total coal revenues in 2024, serving customers in 26 different countries. The company emphasizes its long-term relationships with major steel and coke manufacturers worldwide. A key competitive advantage is its 65% ownership of the Dominion Terminal Associates (DTA) port facility, which provides significant storage capacity and the ability to custom-blend coal to meet specific customer quality requirements. This logistical capability and global reach indicate a sophisticated and effective sales organization.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMR's profit margins are highly sensitive to volatile metallurgical coal prices. In the strong market of 2023, the company achieved an operating margin of 24.9%. In the weaker market of 2024, the operating margin compressed to 7.7%. However, on a non-GAAP basis that adjusts for freight and other costs, the company's Met segment coal margin was $30.64 per ton in 2024, representing a 21.5% margin over its realized price. The ability to remain profitable and generate double-digit non-GAAP margins even in a weaker price environment demonstrates a worthwhile margin structure for a cyclical commodity business.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear focus on margin preservation. The company has strategically transitioned to a "pure-play metallurgical producer" by divesting its thermal coal operations to focus on higher-value products. In November 2024, in response to softening prices, management temporarily idled the higher-cost Checkmate Powellton mine, stating the decision was driven by the mine's economics in the current price environment. This action shows a disciplined approach to curtailing unprofitable production to protect overall margins. The company has also made small, vertically integrated acquisitions of a component manufacturer and trucking assets to secure its supply chain and control costs.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMR maintains a largely union-free workforce, with approximately 97% of its employees not unionized as of December 31, 2024, a significant positive in a historically contentious industry. The company states it has "good relations with our workforce" and highlights safety as a core value. This is substantiated by a 2024 non-fatal days lost (NFDL) safety incident rate that was 46% better than the U.S. industry average. AMR also invests in extensive employee training, including an in-house apprentice miner program to develop a skilled workforce.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior executive team appears stable, with the CEO, COO, and CFO having been appointed to their current roles in 2023 and 2022. The CEO, Andy Eidson, was promoted from his prior role as President and CFO, indicating a planned succession. The average tenure for the management team is 3.3 years. The 2025 proxy statement outlines a compensation program where a substantial portion of executive pay is "at-risk" and tied to company performance metrics, which aligns executive interests with those of shareholders.  
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMR's 2024 10-K lists its executive officers, and the company website details a broader leadership team with senior vice presidents and vice presidents across key functions like operations, sales, transportation, and finance. The promotion of the current CEO from within the company suggests the existence of a succession plan. The leadership team includes experienced individuals in critical roles such as a Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Commercial Officer, indicating a distribution of responsibility beyond the CEO.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.theorg.com/org/alpha-metallurgical-resources/teams/leadership-team](https://www.theorg.com/org/alpha-metallurgical-resources/teams/leadership-team) (Accessed August 21, 2025), [https://www.globaldata.com/company-profile/alpha-metallurgical-resources-inc/](https://www.globaldata.com/company-profile/alpha-metallurgical-resources-inc/) (Accessed August 21, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides clear segment reporting for its Met segment, including key operational metrics like tons sold, realization per ton, and cost of coal sales per ton. The 2024 Form 10-K includes a report from their independent auditor, RSM US LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. There is no history of recent restatements or disclosed material weaknesses.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the seaborne met coal industry, logistics and coal quality are paramount. AMR's 65% ownership of the DTA export terminal is a significant competitive advantage, providing dedicated port access and the ability to custom-blend products, which is a key differentiator for steelmaking customers with precise quality requirements. The company's reserve base is concentrated in Central Appalachia, known for its high-quality met coal, and as of year-end 2024, they controlled 287.8 million tons of proven and probable metallurgical reserves. This combination of high-quality assets and control over a critical piece of the export infrastructure positions AMR favorably against competitors.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's capital allocation balances shareholder returns with long-term investment. While the company has a significant share repurchase program and previously had a dividend, it is also investing heavily in future production. The company expects to spend between $152 million and $182 million on capital expenditures in 2025, including approximately $40 million for mine development projects like the new Kingston Wildcat mine. This willingness to commit significant capital to a multi-year development project that won't generate revenue until late 2025, rather than maximizing short-term buybacks, demonstrates a long-range outlook.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong balance sheet and a policy of returning capital to shareholders, not raising it. As of December 31, 2024, the company had $481.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and only $5.8 million in total long-term debt. From March 2022 through the end of 2024, the company has spent nearly $1.1 billion on share repurchases, significantly reducing its share count. The company's capital expenditure plans for 2025 are expected to be funded by cash on hand and operating cash flow, indicating no need for dilutive equity financing.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion in the 2024 10-K is direct about market challenges. They openly discuss the sharp drop in met coal prices during 2024 and the specific operational response, which was to idle a higher-cost mine. The "Market Overview" section provides a detailed and sober assessment of the global economic factors impacting their business. Reviewing past earnings call transcripts shows a consistent pattern of providing detailed operational updates and market commentary, whether the pricing environment is favorable or not.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags regarding management integrity in the company's recent filings. The 2024 10-K notes that the company is party to legal proceedings from time to time in the ordinary course of business but does not disclose any material issues related to fraud, self-dealing, or major regulatory sanctions against the executive team. The auditor's report is clean, and the company maintains that it has effective internal controls. There is no disclosed history of major scandals or related-party transactions that would call the management's integrity into question.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1704715/000170471525000010/amr-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

---  
Synthesis:
Alpha Metallurgical Resources scores well on most of Fisher's points, reflecting a well-managed company in a challenging industry. Its strongest positives are its excellent financial health, disciplined operational management, strong shareholder return policies, and key logistical advantages through its ownership of the DTA port. The management team appears stable, candid, and aligned with shareholders. The company's primary weaknesses from a Fisher perspective are inherent to its industry: the lack of a traditional R&D engine and a questionable long-term growth runway for its core product due to global decarbonization trends.

The Fisher score will most likely be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the global price of metallurgical coal and the progress of steel industry decarbonization. A sustained downturn in steel demand would pressure margins and could turn the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" point to a "No." Conversely, a delay or slowdown in the development of green steel technologies could improve the long-term demand outlook, potentially flipping the "Products/Services with Long Runway" point to a "Yes." Specific evidence that would change a "No" to a "Yes" would include a major technological breakthrough that makes coal a key part of a "greener" steelmaking process or a significant, long-term supply disruption from a major competitor like Australia that structurally increases the price floor for AMR's products.

fisher score is 13 / 15
