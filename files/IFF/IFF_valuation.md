---

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** We start with the midpoint of management's sales guidance, which is $10.75 billion. This implies a slight decline from TTM revenue, consistent with the company's ongoing portfolio optimization (divestitures).
    *   **Years 2-5:** We will use a growth rate of 2.5%, which is the midpoint of the guided 1% to 4% comparable growth range. This conservative rate reflects a normalization of growth after a period of portfolio changes.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **EBIT Margin:** TTM EBIT margin is 7.1% ($801M / $11,303M). Given the focus on productivity and the divestiture of lower-margin businesses, we assume a stable EBIT margin of 7.5% throughout the forecast period.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** We will use an effective tax rate of 18%, which is a blend of the historical statutory rate and normalized for recent one-time events like the large goodwill impairment.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Following management guidance, Capex is modeled at 6.5% of annual revenue. (IFF 10-Q, May 6, 2025, p. 34)
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled as 0.5% of the change in revenue, based on historical averages which show minimal impact.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** Held constant at the TTM level of $85 million per year.
    *   **Diluted Share Count:** The latest reported diluted weighted-average shares of 256.5 million will be used for the final per-share calculation. (StockAnalysis Income Statement, June 30, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Δ in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $10,750 | $11,019 | $11,294 | $11,577 | $11,866 |
| EBIT (7.5% of Revenue) | $806 | $826 | $847 | $868 | $890 |
| Tax on EBIT (18%) | ($145) | ($149) | ($152) | ($156) | ($160) |
| NOPAT | $661 | $678 | $695 | $712 | $730 |
| D&A | $969 | $969 | $969 | $969 | $969 |
| Capex (6.5% of Revenue) | ($699) | ($716) | ($734) | ($752) | ($771) |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($85) | ($85) | ($85) | ($85) | ($85) |
| Δ in Working Capital | ($3) | ($1) | ($1) | ($1) | ($1) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$844** | **$844** | **$843** | **$842** | **$841** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 19, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. This is a standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta:** 1.25. (Source: Yahoo Finance 5-Year Monthly Beta). This reflects a company with slightly higher volatility than the overall market, which is reasonable given its exposure to commodity cycles and recent portfolio restructuring.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 1.25 * 5.0% = 10.55%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt** = $275M / $6,850M = 4.01%.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.01% * (1 - 18%) = 3.29%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Cap (Equity Value):** $16.87 Billion (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $6.85 Billion (StockAnalysis, June 30, 2025)
    *   **Total Value (V):** $16.87B + $6.85B = $23.72B
    *   **Weight of Equity (E/V):** 71.1%
    *   **Weight of Debt (D/V):** 28.9%
    *   **WACC = (71.1% * 10.55%) + (28.9% * 3.29%) = 7.50% + 0.95% = 8.45%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate (g) of 2.5% is assumed, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   Terminal Value = ($841M * 1.025) / (8.45% - 2.5%) = $862M / 5.95% = **$14,488 Million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA =** EBIT + D&A = $890M + $969M = $1,859M
    *   **Historical Median EV/EBITDA:** The 5-year median EV/EBITDA for IFF has been approximately 17.8x.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) =** $1,859M * 17.8 = $33,090M
    *   **Conclusion:** There is a significant discrepancy. As per instructions, the lower, more conservative Gordon Growth terminal value of **$14,488M** is selected.

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding**
    *   $7,096 Million / 256.5 Million = **$27.66 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$27.66**. This assumes management meets the midpoint of guidance and achieves modest 2.5% long-term growth.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$18.50**. This scenario assumes 0% revenue growth after year 1, EBIT margins contracting to 6.5%, and a higher WACC of 9.5%, resulting in a lower valuation.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$38.00**. This scenario assumes revenue growth at the high end of guidance (4%) for three years before tapering, EBIT margins expanding to 8.5% due to successful cost-cutting, and a lower WACC of 8.0%.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the base-case fair value.
    *   **MOS Price = $27.66 * (1 - 0.30) = $19.36**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Portfolio Realignment Risk:** The ongoing divestiture of non-core assets, while intended to improve margins and focus, carries execution risk. Failure to achieve expected sale prices or effectively streamline operations post-divestiture could negatively impact cash flow.
2.  **Input Cost Volatility:** As a manufacturer of flavors and fragrances, IFF is exposed to fluctuations in the price and availability of raw materials, agricultural commodities, and energy. Significant inflation in these inputs could compress margins if the company is unable to pass costs to customers.
3.  **Integration and Synergy Risk:** Although the major N&B integration is in the past, the company is still working to optimize its global footprint. Failure to realize projected cost savings and productivity gains from restructuring programs could lead to lower-than-forecast profitability.
4.  **Competitive Pressure:** The flavors and fragrances industry is highly competitive. IFF faces pressure from large global competitors and smaller regional players, which could limit pricing power and impact market share.

final answer is 27.66 $
