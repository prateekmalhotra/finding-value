### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**
No specific, quantifiable, long-term guidance for full-year revenue growth or margin targets was found in the reviewed materials. The company provided revenue guidance of $150.0 million to $170.0 million for the third quarter of 2025, but this is insufficient for a long-term forecast. Therefore, the forecast will be based on historical performance and trends.

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Given the historical trend of declining revenue (TTM growth of -19.8%), a conservative forecast is warranted. The base case assumes a stabilization of the business over time.
    *   **Assumption:** Year 1 growth of **-5.0%**, tapering to **0%** by Year 3, and then growing at **1.0%** for Years 4 and 5. This reflects continued near-term headwinds followed by a potential stabilization.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is -8.6%. The average of the last three full fiscal years is approximately -5.5%.
    *   **Assumption:** A stable **-5.0% operating margin** throughout the forecast period. This is more optimistic than the TTM figure but reflects the historical average.
*   **Taxes:** Due to projected operating losses, no cash taxes are assumed. If the company were profitable, a normalized rate would be used.
    *   **Assumption:** **0% effective cash tax rate** on negative pre-tax income.
*   **Capital Intensity & Other Items (% of Revenue):**
    *   **D&A:** **1.0%** of Revenue (in line with historical average of ~0.94%).
    *   **Stock-Based Comp (SBC):** **3.0%** of Revenue (in line with historical average of ~3.1%).
    *   **Capex:** **0.6%** of Revenue (in line with historical average of ~0.55%).
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Assumed to be an outflow of **1.0%** of Revenue annually, reflecting ongoing investment needs.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $709.39 | $691.66 | $691.66 | $698.58 | $705.56 |
| EBIT (-5.0%) | ($35.47) | ($34.58) | ($34.58) | ($34.93) | ($35.28) |
| Tax (0%) | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 | $0.00 |
| NOPAT | ($35.47) | ($34.58) | ($34.58) | ($34.93) | ($35.28) |
| (+) D&A (1.0%) | $7.09 | $6.92 | $6.92 | $6.99 | $7.06 |
| (-) SBC (3.0%) | ($21.28) | ($20.75) | ($20.75) | ($20.96) | ($21.17) |
| (-) Capex (0.6%) | ($4.26) | ($4.15) | ($4.15) | ($4.19) | ($4.23) |
| (-) Change in WC (1.0%) | ($7.09) | ($6.92) | ($6.92) | ($6.99) | ($7.06) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **($61.01)** | **($59.48)** | **($59.48)** | **($60.07)** | **($60.67)** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.30%** (Source: 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.5%** (Standard market assumption).
    *   **Beta (Î²):** **1.39** (Source: Average of 5-Year Monthly Beta). This reflects volatility higher than the broader market, consistent with the company's industry and financial performance.
    *   **Cost of Equity (Ke) = 4.30% + 1.39 * 5.5% = 11.95%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-Tax Cost of Debt: **3.5%** (Inferred from interest expense and total debt).
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt (Kd) = 3.5% * (1 - 0.17) = **2.91%** (using a normalized 17% tax rate for the interest shield calculation).
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): $191.88M ($1.23/share * 156.0M shares).
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $123.67M.
    *   **WACC = (E/(E+D)) * Ke + (D/(E+D)) * Kd = (191.88/315.55) * 11.95% + (123.67/315.55) * 2.91% = 8.40%**

### **F) Terminal Value**
*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%**. This is a conservative rate aligned with long-term inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF_Yr5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (-$60.67M * 1.02) / (8.40% - 2.0%) = -$967.65M**.
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** Given the projected negative EBITDA in Year 5, an exit multiple cross-check is not meaningful and results in a negative value. Therefore, the Gordon Growth method is used, acknowledging the significant uncertainty. The negative terminal value reflects the assumption that the company will not be able to generate positive cash flows in perpetuity based on the current trajectory.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
The present value of all future cash flows, including the terminal value, is negative. This indicates that, under these base-case assumptions, the company's operations are projected to destroy value.

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** -$252.6M
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** -$648.7M
*   **Enterprise Value = PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value = -$901.3M**

Since the Enterprise Value is negative, the Equity Value is also negative, implying no intrinsic value for shareholders based on this DCF model.

*   **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $123.67M - $58.57M = $65.10M**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt = -$901.3M - $65.10M = -$966.4M**

### **H) Per-Share Valuation**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** **$0.00**
    *   The model results in a negative equity value, which means the intrinsic fair value per share is zero. The cash flows projected do not support the value of the debt, let alone any value for equity holders.

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** The base case already results in a zero value. A more pessimistic case (e.g., steeper revenue declines to -10% and operating margins of -10%) would only result in a more negative equity value, reinforcing a **$0.00** per-share value.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** To achieve a positive valuation, GoPro would need to reverse revenue declines and achieve sustained profitability. For example, assuming an immediate return to flat revenue growth and a +2.0% operating margin would still result in a value below the current market price. A substantial turnaround is required to justify even $1.00 per share. The Bull Case value is still estimated at **$0.00** without evidence of a credible turnaround strategy.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Since the Base-Case Fair Value is zero, any price above this provides no margin of safety.
    *   **MOS Price (30% below Base-Case): $0.00**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Sustained Revenue Decline:** The primary risk is the company's inability to stabilize its revenue, which has been in a multi-year decline due to intense competition from smartphones and other action cameras.
2.  **Profitability Challenges:** GoPro has struggled to maintain profitability, with negative operating margins in recent periods. A failure to control costs or improve gross margins could lead to further cash burn.
3.  **Brand Relevance:** The company's brand, while strong in its niche, faces the risk of becoming less relevant as smartphone camera technology continues to improve, reducing the need for a separate dedicated action camera for casual users.
4.  **Model Assumptions:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the assumed long-term growth rate and operating margin. A successful new product launch or a shift in strategy could dramatically change the outlook, but there is no clear evidence of this in the provided data.
