**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, eliminating any foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing. In the first quarter of fiscal 2026 alone, NVIDIA generated $27.4 billion in cash flow from operating activities. As of April 27, 2025, the company held $53.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Rather than issuing shares, NVIDIA is actively returning capital; as of April 27, 2025, it had a remaining authorization to repurchase up to $24.3 billion of its common stock.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm) (May 28, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated candor regarding significant business challenges. In its Q1 fiscal 2026 report, the company was transparent about the impact of new U.S. government export license requirements for its H20 products destined for China. It disclosed a $4.5 billion charge for excess inventory and purchase obligations and explicitly stated that the new rules "will also negatively affect our future revenue." This direct communication about a major headwind shows a commitment to transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm) (May 28, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public filings disclose ongoing legal proceedings that prevent an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity. Specifically, the Form 10-K for fiscal 2025 details a putative securities class action lawsuit alleging that the company and certain executives made materially false or misleading statements regarding the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between 2017 and 2018. While the company is contesting the claims and the case is ongoing, the existence of such a lawsuit concerning the nature of management's disclosures introduces a level of questionability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm) (February 26, 2025)

---
**Synthesis**
NVIDIA scores exceptionally well on nearly all of Fisher's points, reflecting its dominant position in the AI industry, its visionary and stable leadership, and its outstanding financial performance. The company's primary strengths lie in its long-runway products, a deep competitive moat built on the CUDA software ecosystem, and a robust financial model that generates massive cash flow. The single negative point relates to ongoing securities litigation concerning past disclosures, which prevents an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the resolution of this litigation and the sustainability of its technological lead against intensifying competition. A favorable legal outcome would likely flip the "No" on point 15 to a "Yes," while any signs of competitors gaining meaningful traction against the CUDA ecosystem could challenge the "Yes" on competitive clues (point 11) and R&D effectiveness (point 3).

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
