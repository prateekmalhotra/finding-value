### Aggregation:
Weighted Score = (4 * 0.18) + (5 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (5 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02) = 0.72 + 0.75 + 0.45 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.40 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.10 = 3.84
Final Weighted Numeric Score: 76.8 / 100

### Mapping:
A weighted score of 76.8 falls within the 70 ≤ Weighted < 85 range, which maps to a moat rating of 4.

### Moat Duration Justification:
The estimated moat duration is 10-15 years. This is supported by the high switching costs embedded in customer workflows, the strong brand recognition of Autodesk's products, and the extensive ecosystem of third-party developers. The transition to a subscription model further solidifies the company's long-term customer relationships.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios:
1.  **Disruptive New Technology:** A new competitor could emerge with a technologically superior and more cost-effective solution, potentially leading to a paradigm shift in the industry and reducing Autodesk's market share. (Form 10-K, January 31, 2025).
2.  **Weakening of the Ecosystem:** A decline in the number and quality of third-party applications available for Autodesk's products could diminish the value of its platform and lead customers to seek alternatives. (Form 10-K, January 31, 2025).
3.  **Antitrust and Regulatory Scrutiny:** Increased regulatory scrutiny of Autodesk's market position could lead to restrictions on its business practices or forced divestitures, potentially weakening its competitive advantages. (Form 10-K, January 31, 2025).

### KPIs to Monitor:
*   **Net Revenue Retention Rate:** A decline below 100% would indicate that Autodesk is losing revenue from its existing customer base.
*   **Recurring Revenue as a Percentage of Net Revenue:** A decrease in this metric could signal a shift away from the subscription model.
*   **Number of Third-Party Developers and Applications:** A decline in the size and activity of the developer ecosystem could weaken the platform's value.
*   **Research and Development Spending as a Percentage of Revenue:** A significant decrease in R&D investment could indicate a decline in innovation.
*   **Customer Churn Rate:** An increase in the churn rate would suggest that customers are finding it easier to switch to competitors.
*   **Market Share in Key Segments:** A loss of market share in the AEC or manufacturing industries would be a significant concern.
*   **Adoption of New Products:** The success of new offerings like Fusion and Forma is crucial for future growth.
*   **Geographic Revenue Mix:** Over-reliance on a single region could increase geopolitical and economic risks.

### Short Verdict Paragraph:
Autodesk has a strong and durable competitive advantage, primarily driven by high switching costs and a powerful ecosystem. The company's transition to a subscription-based model has further solidified its market position and provides a high degree of revenue visibility. While the company faces competition and the risk of technological disruption, its entrenched position in its core markets and the significant investment required to replicate its product portfolio and ecosystem provide a substantial moat that is likely to endure for the next 10-15 years. A significant and sustained decline in the net revenue retention rate or a mass exodus of third-party developers from the platform would be the most compelling evidence to reconsider this rating.

moat rating is 4 / 5
