SITE Centers Corp. (SITC) Analysis: August 21, 2025. Primary sources reviewed include the SITE Centers Corp. 2024 10-K report, and recent earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SITE Centers operates as a real estate investment trust (REIT), owning and managing open-air shopping centers in suburban, high-income communities. Following the October 1, 2024, spin-off of its 79 convenience properties into Curbline Properties Corp., SITC's portfolio consists of 33 shopping centers. The company's growth potential is now concentrated in a smaller portfolio and is largely dependent on increasing rental rates, leasing vacant space, and redevelopment opportunities. While the company's strategy focuses on a specific niche, the smaller asset base and recent dispositions make a "sizable" increase in sales challenging in the near term. The 2024 10-K indicates that rental and net income are expected to decrease in future periods due to the spin-off and dispositions.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary "development" is in the form of redeveloping and improving its existing properties to attract higher-paying tenants and increase foot traffic. While the company has a history of such projects, its recent strategic shift has been focused on dispositions and capitalizing the new spin-off, Curbline. The 2024 10-K states, "Going forward, the Company intends to realize value through operations and to consider various factors... in evaluating whether and when to pursue additional asset sales." This suggests a focus on optimizing the existing, smaller portfolio rather than large-scale development. There is an obligation to complete $32.9 million in redevelopment for properties now owned by Curbline, but this is a legacy commitment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a REIT, SITE Centers does not have traditional R&D expenses. The equivalent would be its investment in property redevelopment and market analysis to identify growth opportunities. Given the recent portfolio reduction, the scale of these activities has likely decreased. The company's ability to drive rental growth and high occupancy rates are the primary metrics of its effectiveness in this area.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** Not applicable, as REITs do not have formal R&D.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "sales organization" for a REIT is its leasing team. SITE Centers has demonstrated an ability to attract and retain major national and regional tenants. The company's five largest tenants are well-known retailers, indicating strong relationships. The pro rata combined shopping center portfolio had an aggregate occupancy rate of 90.6% at the end of 2024, up from 89.5% in the prior year, suggesting effective leasing. The company also achieved positive blended lease spreads of 7.8% in 2024, indicating its ability to negotiate favorable rental terms.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a REIT, traditional profit margins are less relevant than metrics like Funds From Operations (FFO) and Net Operating Income (NOI). For the year ended December 31, 2024, net income attributable to common shareholders was $516.0 million on total revenues of $277.5 million, a figure skewed by gains on property sales. Operating FFO, a measure of core performance, was $166.7 million in 2024. A precise comparison to peers is difficult without a deep dive into industry benchmarks, but the company is profitable from an FFO perspective. However, with the recent spin-off, the future margin profile is less certain.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is focused on operational efficiencies and optimizing its now smaller portfolio. Key actions include increasing rental rates, as evidenced by the positive leasing spreads, and maintaining high occupancy levels. Additionally, the shared services agreement with Curbline Properties generates fee income, although this is not expected to fully offset the costs of providing those services. The company is also marketing additional assets for sale, with the potential to use proceeds to pay down debt and reduce interest expense.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K notes a significant portion of its workforce has a long tenure, with 83% of employees having been with the company for over 5 years and 60% for over 10 years. This suggests a stable and potentially positive work environment. The company also highlights its competitive pay, benefits, and flexible work arrangements. However, there was a reduction in workforce from 220 to 172 full-time employees from year-end 2023 to 2024, partly due to the Curbline spin-off. While the tenure data is strong, the recent workforce reduction adds a layer of complexity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is a notable overlap in the executive teams of SITE Centers and the newly formed Curbline Properties. David R. Lukes is the President and CEO of both companies, and John M. Cattonar is the Chief Investment Officer for both. This arrangement, governed by a Shared Services Agreement, could create conflicts of interest. While this structure may be efficient, it is not a typical setup and could lead to challenges in allocating executive time and attention. The recent appointment of a new CFO in October 2024 also indicates a degree of change in the executive ranks.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team listed in the 2024 10-K includes a CEO, CFO, and CIO, along with a General Counsel. The individuals have extensive experience in the real estate industry. However, the dual roles of the CEO and CIO at both SITC and Curbline raise questions about the depth and focus of the management team dedicated solely to SITC. While the team is experienced, the structure creates potential for distraction and conflicts.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SITE Centers is a seasoned public company with a history of regular SEC filings. The 2024 10-K includes a statement on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, and the company's independent registered public accounting firm has provided an unqualified opinion. The company is currently transitioning to a new commercial property management and financial system, which introduces some risk but also suggests a focus on improving controls and analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key aspect for a retail REIT is the quality and location of its properties. SITE Centers focuses on properties in suburban, high-income communities, which tend to be more resilient to economic downturns. The spin-off of convenience properties has further concentrated the portfolio into what the company presumably believes are its core, high-quality assets. The ability to maintain high occupancy and positive leasing spreads in the current retail environment is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The spin-off of Curbline Properties was a major strategic move that suggests a long-range view. By separating the two distinct property types, management is aiming to unlock value for each. However, the 2024 10-K also indicates an ongoing evaluation of asset sales, which could prioritize short-term gains over long-term holdings. The company's future dividend policy will also be influenced by asset sales, which could imply a more short-term focus. The evidence is mixed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has recently undergone a significant deleveraging, repaying all of its unsecured debt and preferred shares. As of December 31, 2024, its consolidated debt was $306.8 million. The company's primary sources of capital are listed as cash flow from operations, debt financing, and asset sales. In May 2024, the company terminated its "at the market" equity program. The current focus on asset sales and a reduced debt load suggests that the company is not likely to issue a significant amount of new equity in the near term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company regularly holds earnings calls and provides detailed financial reports. The transcripts of these calls are publicly available. The recent major strategic moves, including the spin-off, have been communicated to the market. The 10-K includes a detailed discussion of the risks facing the company, including potential conflicts of interest with Curbline. This level of disclosure suggests a willingness to be transparent with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SITC/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SITC/transcripts/) (2024)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no major red flags such as legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions (outside of the Curbline relationship, which is fully disclosed), or audit issues noted in the 2024 10-K. The company has a code of business conduct and ethics that employees are required to adhere to. The primary area of concern is the potential for conflicts of interest arising from the shared management with Curbline. While this is a governance risk, it is disclosed and does not in itself imply a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/894315/000095017025029989/sitc-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)
---
**Synthesis:**
SITE Centers has undergone a significant transformation with the spin-off of its convenience properties, resulting in a smaller, more focused portfolio of shopping centers in affluent suburban areas. The company's strengths lie in its high occupancy rates, ability to generate positive leasing spreads, and a recently deleveraged balance sheet. However, the company faces challenges related to its smaller scale, which may limit growth opportunities. The shared management structure with Curbline Properties presents a notable governance risk and potential for conflicts of interest. Over the next 12-24 months, the key variables that will likely influence the score are the company's ability to demonstrate growth in its smaller portfolio, the execution of any further asset sales, and the management of the relationship with Curbline. A "No" on long-runway products/services could be flipped to a "Yes" if the company can demonstrate a clear path to significant growth through redevelopment and leasing in its remaining properties. Similarly, a "No" on executive relations could be reconsidered if the shared management structure with Curbline proves to be effective and does not lead to any negative outcomes for SITC shareholders.
