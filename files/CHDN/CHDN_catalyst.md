### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Expansion of Historical Horse Racing (HHR) Venues in Kentucky and Virginia.

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is actively expanding its HHR operations with the recent opening of The Rose Gaming Resort in Virginia (November 2024) and Owensboro Racing and Gaming in Kentucky (February 2025). Further expansions are planned, including at Rosie's Richmond and the new Roseshire facility in Virginia.
*   **Mechanism:** New and expanded HHR venues will drive incremental revenue and EBITDA growth. This will increase free cash flow, which can be used for further investments, debt reduction, or shareholder returns, leading to a higher stock valuation.
*   **Timing:** The financial impact of the newly opened venues will be fully realized in the next 12 months. The Rosie's Richmond expansion is expected by Q3 2025, and Roseshire by Q4 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Assumes slower-than-expected ramp-up at new properties and modest growth at existing ones.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Based on management's discussion of strong performance at new venues, we can project incremental EBITDA.
    *   **High Scenario:** Assumes a faster ramp-up and stronger-than-expected consumer demand.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%. The Live and Historical Racing segment is a significant growth driver, and successful execution of these projects will likely lead to upward revisions in earnings estimates.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The projects are already underway, and the company has a strong track record of successful HHR expansion.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful integration and ramp-up of new properties, and continued consumer demand for HHR gaming.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth in the Live and Historical Racing segment, particularly from the new and expanded Virginia and Kentucky HRM venues.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Potential for slower-than-expected ramp-up at new properties, increased competition, or a downturn in consumer discretionary spending.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The market may not have fully priced in the long-term earnings potential of these new and expanded HHR venues.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Board of Directors approved a new $500 million stock repurchase program in March 2025, which includes the remaining authorization from the 2021 program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, with a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** The repurchase program is ongoing and has no time limit, but the company has been actively repurchasing shares.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases shares at a slow pace.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company continues to repurchase shares at a steady pace, in line with recent activity.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company accelerates share repurchases, particularly if the stock price is undervalued.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%. While the impact is smaller than operational catalysts, it provides a steady tailwind for the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a history of executing on its share repurchase authorizations.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation to fund repurchases, and a stock price that management deems attractive for buybacks.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in the company's 10-Q and 10-K filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in the business could reduce cash flow available for repurchases. A sharp run-up in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The share repurchase program provides a degree of downside protection and enhances shareholder returns.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Capital Investments at Churchill Downs Racetrack

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is undertaking a multi-year investment plan at Churchill Downs Racetrack, including the renovation of the Paddock, Starting Gate Pavilion, Finish Line Suites and The Mansion.
*   **Mechanism:** These investments are designed to enhance the guest experience, particularly for premium customers, allowing for higher ticket prices and increased sponsorship revenue. This will drive long-term, high-margin revenue growth from the Kentucky Derby and other events.
*   **Timing:** The renovations are expected to be completed in phases, with some coming online for the 2025 Kentucky Derby and others by the 2026 Kentucky Derby.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Assumes cost overruns and a smaller-than-expected return on investment.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Based on management's expectation of strong returns from these projects.
    *   **High Scenario:** Assumes a "step function" growth in Derby-related EBITDA, as suggested by management.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 15-25%. The Kentucky Derby is a unique and highly profitable asset, and investments that enhance its value can have a significant impact on the company's valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The projects are underway, but large-scale construction projects always carry some risk of delays or cost overruns.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful and timely completion of the renovation projects, and continued demand for premium Kentucky Derby experiences.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Company announcements on the progress of the renovation projects, and growth in Derby Week Adjusted EBITDA in the years following project completion.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Construction delays, cost overruns, or a failure to realize the expected return on investment. A major disruption to the Kentucky Derby (e.g., due to a pandemic or other unforeseen event) could also negatively impact returns.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The long-term value creation from these investments is likely not fully reflected in the current stock price.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

1.  **HHR Expansion:**
    *   **Assumption:** The new and expanded HHR venues in Kentucky and Virginia add $50 million in annual Adjusted EBITDA.
    *   **Valuation Impact:** At a 10x EV/EBITDA multiple, this would add $500 million to the company's enterprise value.
2.  **Churchill Downs Racetrack Investments:**
    *   **Assumption:** The capital investments at Churchill Downs Racetrack lead to a $30 million increase in Derby Week Adjusted EBITDA.
    *   **Valuation Impact:** Given the unique nature of the Derby, this could be valued at a higher multiple (e.g., 15x), adding $450 million to the enterprise value.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts is positive. The ongoing expansion of the high-growth HHR business, coupled with a supportive share repurchase program, should provide a positive tailwind for the stock over the next 0-12 months. While there are risks related to consumer spending and the ramp-up of new properties, the company's strong execution and clear growth strategy suggest a positive short-term market signal.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A significant downturn in the U.S. economy:** This could lead to a sharp decline in consumer discretionary spending, which would negatively impact all of the company's business segments.
2.  **Adverse regulatory changes:** Changes in gaming laws or regulations in key states like Kentucky and Virginia could restrict the company's ability to operate and expand its HHR business.
3.  **A major disruption to the Kentucky Derby:** An unforeseen event that leads to the cancellation or significant curtailment of the Kentucky Derby would have a severe negative impact on the company's financial results and reputation.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

We recommend a "Buy" rating for Churchill Downs Incorporated. The company has a clear and executable growth strategy focused on the expansion of its high-margin HHR business and enhancing the value of its unique and iconic Kentucky Derby asset. We see a potential upside of 15-25% over the next 12-24 months as the market fully appreciates the earnings power of these growth initiatives. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly performance of the Live and Historical Racing segment, particularly the revenue and EBITDA growth from the new and expanded HRM venues in Virginia and Kentucky.
