Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan operates in the growing markets for secure authentication and digital agreements, which are benefiting from long-term trends of digital transformation and increasing cybersecurity threats. The company's Digital Agreements segment grew its revenue by 20% in 2024, and the company is emphasizing a shift to a subscription-based model. In the first quarter of 2025, subscription revenue for Security Solutions and Digital Agreements grew 7% and 13%, respectively, year-over-year, and Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) grew 9% to $168.4 million.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's research and development expenses were $32.4 million in 2024 and $7.9 million in the first quarter of 2025. OneSpan's R&D efforts are focused on enhancing its solutions, developing new features and functionality, and building out its transaction-cloud platform. The company is actively developing solutions to meet new market demands, such as FIDO2-certified phishing-resistant passkeys.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Research and development expenses accounted for 13.3% of total revenue in 2024. The company holds patents that expire between 2026 and 2040 and has several pending patent applications. However, the company faces intense competition from larger players like DocuSign and Adobe, and its 2023 strategic plan for revenue growth in Digital Agreements was deemed unlikely to be achieved, suggesting challenges in translating R&D into market share gains against well-entrenched competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan has a strong foothold in the global banking sector, serving more than 60% of the world's 100 largest banks. The company reported a Net Retention Rate (NRR) of 106% at the end of 2024 and 107% as of March 31, 2025, which indicates success in retaining and expanding revenue from its existing customer base. The sales channels are diversified, including a direct sales force, distributors, and system integrators.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated strong profitability following a strategic shift. For the fiscal year 2024, the gross margin was 72% and the operating margin was 18.4%. In the first quarter of 2025, the gross margin increased to 74% and the operating margin was a robust 27.1%.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In August 2023, the Board of Directors approved cost reduction actions to improve profitability. These actions included reducing headcount by approximately 330 positions through 2024 and rationalizing real estate and vendor contracts. The company is also strategically focusing on higher-margin software and subscription solutions over lower-margin hardware. These actions have directly contributed to the significant improvement in operating margins in 2024 and Q1 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company reported a voluntary turnover rate of 12.4% in 2024, which it considers favorable for the tech industry. However, total attrition was 24.3% in 2024, primarily due to significant restructuring and cost-reduction efforts that eliminated approximately 330 positions. Such a large workforce reduction, while a strategic necessity for the company, makes it difficult to classify labor relations as "outstanding" due to the likely impact on employee morale and stability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been recent turnover at the highest level of the company. Victor Limongelli was appointed CEO in July 2024 after serving as Interim CEO since January 2024. This followed the departure of the previous CEO. While the current executive team has relevant experience, the recent change in leadership does not meet the high bar of "outstanding" executive relations, which implies long-term stability and a proven track record as a team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K lists biographical information for the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, and General Counsel. While this indicates a core executive team is in place, the filings do not provide sufficient detail on the breadth of leadership below the executive level or discuss succession planning. Without more information on the leaders of the key business segments and their tenure, it is difficult to confirm sufficient management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 Form 10-K, OneSpan's management concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024. The company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The company also provides segment-level financial data, allowing for analysis of costs and profitability by business unit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpan’s key competitive advantage is its deep entrenchment within the highly regulated global financial services industry. The company states that it is trusted by over 60% of the world's 100 largest banks. This customer base has high switching costs due to stringent security requirements, complex integrations, and regulatory compliance needs. This long-standing trust and installed base in a demanding industry is a strong indicator of the company's competitive standing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy shifted in mid-2023 away from a focus on driving revenue growth in its Digital Agreements segment to a strategy focused "more heavily on improving profitability across the business." This was a direct response to determining that the prior growth targets were unlikely to be met in the desired timeframe. While this is a pragmatic move, it explicitly prioritizes achieving near-term profitability over a previous growth-focused strategy.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, OneSpan had a strong balance sheet with $105.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt. The company generated $55.7 million in cash from operating activities in 2024. Furthermore, the company has a share repurchase program in place, indicating it is returning capital to shareholders, not seeking to raise it through dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K provides a candid explanation for the company's strategic shift in 2023. Management openly stated that it was "unlikely to achieve the revenue growth levels set forth in that strategic plan" due to market competitiveness and brand awareness challenges. This disclosure about a strategic shortcoming demonstrates a willingness to communicate transparently with investors about both successes and failures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Legal Proceedings" sections of the 2024 10-K and Q1 2025 10-Q state that the company is subject to claims incidental to its business but does not anticipate any material adverse impact. The filings do not disclose any material legal or regulatory actions, related-party transactions, or other governance issues that would bring management's integrity into question.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000162828025008750/ospn-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1044777/000104477725000002/ospn-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

Synthesis:
OneSpan scores positively on several key Fisher points, particularly those related to financial strength, market position, and profitability. The company has a strong, debt-free balance sheet, generates healthy cash flow, and has executed a successful turnaround to restore robust profit margins. Its entrenched position within the global banking sector provides a significant competitive moat and a long runway for its security and digital agreement products. However, the analysis also reveals weaknesses in qualitative areas like management stability and personnel relations. Recent CEO turnover and significant staff reductions due to restructuring raise concerns about the company's long-term stability and culture. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12–24 months will be the new CEO's ability to establish a clear long-term vision, a stabilization of employee turnover, and evidence that its R&D investments can produce innovative products that compete effectively against larger rivals. A "No" on R&D Effectiveness could flip to "Yes" with the successful launch and market adoption of a new flagship product, while a "No" on Executive Relations would require a period of stable leadership with a consistent strategic direction.

fisher score is 9 / 15
