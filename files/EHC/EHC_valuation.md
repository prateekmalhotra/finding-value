Of course. Here is a revised and corrected version of the intrinsic value analysis for Encompass Health Corporation (EHC).

I have identified several areas for improvement, primarily focusing on creating more realistic long-term assumptions and refining the terminal value calculation, which you correctly identified as a key point of conservatism. The revised valuation uses the same format and incorporates all original information while adjusting the model's core drivers.

### **Key Issues Identified in the Original Analysis:**

1.  **Abrupt Revenue Growth Taper:** The drop from 6.0% to 4.0% growth over just two years was somewhat aggressive. A smoother, more gradual deceleration is often more realistic.
2.  **Unstated Modeling Assumptions:** The drivers for forecasting Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) and Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) were not explicitly stated in the assumptions section, making the forecast less transparent.
3.  **Overly Conservative Terminal Value:** The primary issue. The Gordon Growth Method resulted in an implied exit multiple (8.2x EV/EBITDA) at the absolute low end of the company's historical trading range. For a stable, non-discretionary business like EHC, this is likely too pessimistic and undervalues the company's long-term cash-generating potential.

The following analysis corrects these points to present a more balanced and realistic base-case valuation.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section determines the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price. This part remains unchanged as its logic and calculations are sound.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $84.50 (as of August 24, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (LTM):** The following table presents the Latest Twelve Months (LTM) financial data for the period ended June 30, 2025.

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source & Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,951 | |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $818 | |
| Net Income | $481 | |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $328 | |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $55 | |
| Capital Expenditures | ($488) | |
| Change in Working Capital | ($12) | |
| Interest Expense | $145 | |
| Cash & Equivalents | $63 | |
| Total Debt | $3,371 | |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 100.4 | |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market's implied assumptions, we will hold the LTM EBIT margin constant and find the revenue growth rate required to justify the current price.

*   **Enterprise Value:** $84.50/share * 100.4M shares + $3,371M Debt - $63M Cash = $11,790M.
*   **LTM EBIT Margin:** $818M / $4,951M = 16.5%.
*   **WACC (preliminary):** A WACC of 7.02% is used for this calculation (detailed in Part 2).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%.

**Conclusion: Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current enterprise value of approximately $11,790 million, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 9.3%**, assuming a stable EBIT margin of 16.5%. This implies a belief in sustained, high-single-digit growth for the next five years.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Balanced Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on independent, realistic assumptions grounded in historical performance and a balanced view of future expectations.

**C) FORMULATE BALANCED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** The market's implied 9.3% is optimistic. Historical growth has been closer to 6-7%. A balanced forecast acknowledges continued execution on the company's de-novo strategy while factoring in a mature market. I will use a **6.0% growth rate for years 1-2, tapering smoothly to 4.5% by year 5.**
*   **Operating Margin:** The LTM margin is 16.5%, and the 3-year average is ~16%. An assumption of a constant **16.2% EBIT margin** is a prudent and realistic base case, reflecting a stable operating environment.
*   **Taxes:** The historical average effective tax rate of **24.0%** remains a reasonable assumption.
*   **Capital Intensity & Other Costs:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled at **9.5% of revenue**, consistent with historical investment in development and maintenance.
    *   **D&A:** Modeled at **6.6% of revenue**, in line with the LTM ratio ($328M / $4,951M).
    *   **Working Capital:** Change in working capital is modeled as **2.0% of the change in revenue**.
    *   **SBC:** Stock-based compensation is modeled at **1.1% of revenue**, in line with the LTM ratio ($55M / $4,951M). This is treated as a real cash outflow.
*   **Share Count:** The forecast will use the latest **100.4 million diluted shares outstanding**, assuming dilution from SBC is offset by buybacks.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation

| (USD in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,248 | $5,563 | $5,869 | $6,162 | $6,440 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *6.0%* | *6.0%* | *5.5%* | *5.0%* | *4.5%* |
| EBIT | $850 | $901 | $951 | $998 | $1,043 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *16.2%* | *16.2%* | *16.2%* | *16.2%* | *16.2%* |
| Taxes (24.0%) | ($204) | ($216) | ($228) | ($240) | ($250) |
| EBIAT | $646 | $685 | $723 | $758 | $793 |
| (+) D&A | $346 | $367 | $387 | $407 | $425 |
| (-) Capex | ($499) | ($528) | ($558) | ($585) | ($612) |
| (-) Change in NWC | ($6) | ($6) | ($6) | ($6) | ($6) |
| (-) SBC | ($58) | ($61) | ($65) | ($68) | ($71) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$429** | **$457** | **$481** | **$506** | **$529** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

The WACC calculation remains unchanged as its inputs are based on current market data.

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** 8.50%
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.25%; Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%; Beta: 0.85.
*   **Cost of Debt:** 3.27% (after-tax)
    *   Pre-Tax Cost of Debt: 4.3%; Tax Rate: 24.0%.
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   MVE: $8,484M; MVD: $3,371M; V: $11,855M.
    *   **WACC = (71.6% * 8.50%) + (28.4% * 3.27%) = 7.02%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

The Exit Multiple method is used as the primary valuation driver to correct for the overly conservative nature of the original Gordon Growth calculation.

*   **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $1,043M + $425M = $1,468M.
    *   A **9.0x EV/EBITDA multiple** is selected. This sits comfortably in the middle of the historical 8x-11x range for EHC and its peers, representing a normalized valuation for a stable healthcare services leader.
    *   **Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple**
    *   **Terminal Value = $1,468M * 9.0 = $13,212M**
*   **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   This terminal value implies a perpetual growth rate (g) of **3.0%**.
    *   Implied g = (WACC * TV - FCFF_5) / (TV + FCFF_5) = (0.0702 * 13212 - 529) / (13212 + 529) = 3.02%
    *   A 3.0% implied growth rate is slightly higher than long-term GDP growth but remains reasonable for a stable industry leader, confirming that the 9.0x multiple is not overly aggressive.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

*   **Present Value (PV) of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   PV = ($429/1.0702¹) + ($457/1.0702²) + ($481/1.0702³) + ($506/1.0702⁴) + ($529/1.0702⁵) = $1,962M
*   **PV of Terminal Value:**
    *   PV = $13,212M / (1.0702⁵) = $9,392M
*   **Total Enterprise Value:** $1,962M + $9,392M = **$11,354M**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Equity Value = $11,354M - ($3,371M Debt - $63M Cash) = **$8,046M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   Value per Share = $8,046M / 100.4M = **$80.14**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $80.14.** (6% revenue growth tapering to 4.5%, 16.2% EBIT margin, 9.0x exit multiple).
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$65.** (4% revenue growth, 15.5% margin compression, 8.0x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$96.** (7% revenue growth, 16.5% margin, 9.5x exit multiple).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate to account for forecast uncertainty and potential risks.
    *   MOS Price = $80.14 * (1 - 0.30) = **$56.10**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Reimbursement Risk:** As a major provider of inpatient rehabilitation services, EHC is highly dependent on reimbursement rates from government payers like Medicare, which are subject to legislative and regulatory changes.
2.  **Labor Costs:** Rising labor costs, particularly for nurses and therapists, could compress margins if not offset by price increases or efficiencies.
3.  **Competition:** The healthcare landscape is competitive, with risks from other large operators and smaller, local providers for patient volumes.
4.  **Development Risk:** The company's growth strategy relies on opening new hospitals ("de-novo" strategy), which carries execution risk and requires significant capital expenditure.
