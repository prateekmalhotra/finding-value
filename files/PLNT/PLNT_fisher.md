Planet Fitness, Inc. (PLNT), August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and the Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness operates in the large U.S. fitness industry and has a significant growth runway. Management has identified a long-term potential for 5,000 domestic stores, a substantial increase from the 2,603 stores open as of June 30, 2025. International expansion in markets like Mexico and Australia represents an additional, less penetrated growth vector. The company’s value-oriented model, targeting the 80% of the population without a gym membership, provides a large addressable market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's focus is on evolving the member experience and franchise system rather than creating new "products." This includes investments in the PLNT mobile app to increase engagement, testing new equipment, and piloting a "Black Card+” premium membership tier. During the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Colleen Keating emphasized a focus on "driving greater member engagement and franchisee support" through technology and operational initiatives. This reflects a commitment to process improvement and service enhancement to drive sales.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness does not have a dedicated Research & Development expense line item, as its business model is not based on creating proprietary technology or patented products. Investments in development are embedded within G&A and capital expenditures, such as technology for the mobile app or testing new store layouts. As such, it is not possible to measure the effectiveness of formal R&D relative to its size or peers in other industries. The company is a service and franchise operator, not an R&D-driven enterprise.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "sales" engine is twofold: franchise development and member acquisition. The franchise sales model has proven highly effective, with a pipeline of 850+ contractually obligated new stores as of late 2024. At the consumer level, the marketing model, focused on a non-intimidating "Judgement Free Zone," has successfully grown membership to over 19 million. The consistent growth in both store count and membership demonstrates an above-average sales and marketing function for its industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000070/plnt-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000016/plnt-20241231.htm (February 22, 2025)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness operates a highly profitable, capital-light franchise model. For the second quarter of 2025, the company reported an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 41.5%. The Franchise segment, which is the company's core driver of profit, consistently generates segment EBITDA margins over 90%. While the Corporate-owned stores segment has lower margins, the consolidated business model is designed to produce high returns.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000070/plnt-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary margin improvement lever is pricing. Management is testing a price increase for its Classic Card membership from $10 to $15 per month for new members, which would significantly improve unit economics if rolled out system-wide. Additionally, the continued shift in revenue mix towards the high-margin franchise segment as the system grows naturally improves consolidated margins. The company also focuses on G&A discipline as a way to create operating leverage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PLNT/transcripts/ (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 6, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The vast majority of in-store employees are employed directly by franchisees, insulating the parent company from most club-level labor matters. At the corporate level, there are no disclosures of significant labor disputes or unionization activities. The company's 2024 10-K states it provides competitive wages and benefits and considers its employee relations to be good. Without specific metrics on turnover or employee engagement, and given the franchise model, there is insufficient evidence to deem relations "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000016/plnt-20241231.htm (February 22, 2025)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness has undergone significant executive transition. The company appointed a new CEO, Colleen Keating, in February 2024, following the departure of the long-time former CEO Chris Rondeau in September 2023. This was followed by the departure of the President and CFO in mid-2024, with an interim CFO appointed. Such substantial turnover in the C-suite in a short period suggests a lack of stable and outstanding executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000016/plnt-20241231.htm (February 22, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent, significant turnover at the highest levels, including the CEO and CFO/President roles, calls the company's management depth into question. While a new CEO is in place and an interim CFO was appointed from within (the former Chief Accounting Officer), the departure of multiple top executives creates a potential vacuum of institutional knowledge and strategic leadership. The stability of the broader leadership team below the C-suite is not clearly detailed in filings.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000070/plnt-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness provides clear segment reporting for its three business lines (Franchise, Corporate-owned Stores, and Equipment), with detailed revenue and cost breakdowns for each. The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. There is no recent history of material weaknesses or restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000016/plnt-20241231.htm (February 22, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness's key competitive advantage is its national scale and brand recognition in the high-value, low-price (HVLP) fitness category. Its "Judgement Free Zone" branding effectively targets casual and first-time gym users, a large and underserved market segment that higher-priced competitors often ignore. The capital-light franchise model allows for rapid unit growth and high margins, creating a flywheel effect where franchisee profitability fuels further expansion and brand awareness.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000016/plnt-20241231.htm (February 22, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary consistently prioritizes long-term, sustainable growth of the franchise system. For instance, the company provides support to franchisees, sometimes in the form of waived fees or marketing funds, to ensure the health of the overall system, which may impact short-term corporate revenue but fosters long-term unit growth. The ongoing investments in technology and brand marketing are designed to build a durable competitive moat rather than maximize next-quarter earnings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PLNT/transcripts/ (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 6, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is self-funding and has historically returned capital to shareholders. As of June 30, 2025, Planet Fitness had $390 million in cash and generated free cash flow of $65 million in the first half of the year. The business model requires minimal corporate capital expenditure for growth, as franchisees fund new store construction. The company actively repurchases shares, having bought back 1.2 million shares for $79 million in the first half of 2025, indicating a commitment to avoiding dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000070/plnt-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed quarterly reporting and hosts conference calls with extensive Q&A sessions. During recent calls, executives have been transparent about challenges, including shifts in consumer workout habits, franchisee profitability pressures due to inflation, and the rationale behind executive transitions. They openly discuss testing new strategies, like the tiered pricing model, before a full rollout, and they provide specific KPIs on membership trends and store openings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PLNT/transcripts/ (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 6, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags such as major regulatory investigations, sanctions, or accounting scandals disclosed in the company's SEC filings. The 2024 10-K includes a Code of Conduct applicable to all employees and directors and details standard governance practices. While the abrupt nature of the former CEO's departure in 2023 raised questions among investors, it was not tied to any disclosed findings of financial impropriety or malfeasance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637207/000163720725000016/plnt-20241231.htm (February 22, 2025)]

---
**Synthesis**
Planet Fitness scores 11/15, demonstrating fundamental strengths in its capital-light franchise model, dominant brand positioning in the value fitness segment, and clear runway for domestic growth. The business exhibits strong and durable profit margins, generates significant free cash flow, and maintains a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. Key weaknesses are concentrated in management instability, with significant C-suite turnover in the last year creating uncertainty around strategy and execution. The score could improve significantly in the next 12–24 months if the new CEO, Colleen Keating, establishes a stable leadership team and demonstrates successful execution of growth initiatives, particularly the new pricing strategy. A "No" on Executive Relations and Management Depth would flip to "Yes" with a year of stable leadership and clear communication of a long-term vision that the market endorses.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
