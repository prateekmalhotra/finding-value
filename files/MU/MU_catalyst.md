### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) Ramp-Up**

*   **Assumption:** Micron achieves the base case of $2.5 billion in additional HBM revenue in fiscal 2025.
*   **Formula:** Additional EPS = (Additional Revenue \* HBM Gross Margin) / Shares Outstanding
*   **Calculation:** ($2.5B \* 50% GPM) / 1.12B shares = $1.12 additional EPS
*   **Valuation Impact:** At a 15x P/E multiple, this could add ~$17 to the share price.
*   **Citation for Shares Outstanding:** As of March 13, 2025, there were 1,117,571,525 shares of common stock outstanding.

**2. U.S. CHIPS Act Funding**

*   **Assumption:** Micron receives the base case of $6.1 billion in direct funding over five years.
*   **Formula:** Annual Capex Reduction = Total Grant / Number of Years
*   **Calculation:** $6.1B / 5 years = $1.22B annual capex reduction
*   **Valuation Impact:** This reduction in capex will directly increase free cash flow, making the stock more attractive to investors and potentially leading to a higher valuation multiple. A $1.22B annual increase in FCF could add over $10B to the company's valuation at a 10x P/FCF multiple.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Micron are overwhelmingly positive, with the ramp-up of HBM production for AI data centers being the most significant driver. The recovery in the broader data center and networking markets provides a strong tailwind, while the financial benefits of the CHIPS Act will begin to be realized within the next 12 months. The combination of these factors is likely to produce positive stock performance in the 0-12 month timeframe.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Downturn in the Global Economy:** A major recession would significantly reduce demand for all of Micron's products, including HBM, and could lead to a sharp decline in memory prices.
2.  **Geopolitical Conflict:** An escalation of tensions between the U.S. and China could disrupt Micron's global supply chain and access to key markets, and potentially impact its operations in Taiwan.
3.  **Faster-Than-Expected Technological Obsolescence:** A competitor could develop a breakthrough memory technology that renders Micron's current product portfolio obsolete, leading to a rapid loss of market share.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Micron Technology, Inc. presents a compelling investment case with multiple near-term and long-term catalysts. The most significant of these is the company's ramp-up of HBM production to meet the insatiable demand from the AI industry, which could add over 30% to the company's valuation. The substantial financial support from the U.S. CHIPS Act further de-risks the company's ambitious expansion plans. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly revenue growth and margin profile of the Compute and Networking Business Unit, which will reflect the success of the HBM ramp.
