### B) Management Guidance Extraction

*   **Q3 2025 Revenue:** "We expect third quarter 2025 total revenue to be in the range of $47.5-50.5 billion." (Q2 2025 Earnings Release, July 30, 2025)

*   **2025 Total Expenses:** "We expect full year 2025 total expenses to be in the range of $114-118 billion" (Q2 2025 Earnings Release, July 30, 2025)

### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** 15% - This is a blend of the midpoint of Q3 guidance (approximately 21% YoY growth) and a moderation in Q4, reflecting a slight deceleration from the strong growth in the first half of 2025.
    *   **Years 2-5:** Tapering down to 8% by Year 5, reflecting a gradual moderation of growth as the company matures and faces tougher comparables.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** 40% - This is slightly below the TTM operating margin of 43.37% to reflect management's guidance of increased expenses in 2025, and then held constant, as no specific business initiatives for margin expansion were mentioned.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 15% - Based on the 3-year average effective tax rate of approximately 15%, which normalizes for any significant one-off events.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** **Year 1:** $69,000 million (midpoint of management guidance). **Years 2-5:** 35% of revenue, slightly below the historical average to reflect a normalization of AI-related spending.
    *   **Working Capital:** 10% of incremental revenue, based on historical averages.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** Treated as a real economic cost and subtracted from FCFF. Modeled as 10% of revenue, consistent with historical levels.
    *   **Share Count:** 2,595 million (latest diluted weighted-average shares).

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

**FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $205,625 | $230,300 | $253,330 | $273,596 | $295,484 |
| EBIT | $82,250 | $92,120 | $101,332 | $109,438 | $118,194 |
| EBIT(1-t) | $69,913 | $78,302 | $86,132 | $93,023 | $100,465 |
| D&A | $18,506 | $20,727 | $22,799 | $24,624 | $26,594 |
| SBC | -$20,563 | -$23,030 | -$25,333 | -$27,360 | -$29,548 |
| Capex | -$69,000 | -$80,605 | -$88,665 | -$95,759 | -$103,420 |
| Change in WC | -$2,682 | -$2,467 | -$2,303 | -$2,027 | -$2,189 |
| **FCFF** | **-$3,826** | **-$7,073** | **-$7,369** | **-$7,498** | **-$8,098** |

*Using FCFF for valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.*

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (10-year U.S. Treasury yield, August 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard market premium)
    *   **Beta:** 1.27 (5-year monthly beta from StockAnalysis.com) - This beta reflects the company's higher-than-market volatility, which is appropriate given its exposure to the dynamic and competitive tech industry.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 1.27 \* 5.0% = 10.65%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt = $941 / $49,560 = 1.90%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity (Market Cap):** $1,940,000 million (approx. based on 2,595M shares \* $747.72 share price)
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $49,560 million
    *   **WACC = (E/(E+D)) \* Ke + (D/(E+D)) \* Kd \* (1-t) = (1940000/1989560) \* 10.65% + (49560/1989560) \* 1.90% \* (1-0.15) = 10.39%**

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (capped at long-run inflation expectation)
    *   **Terminal Value = FCFF(6) / (WACC - g) = (-$8,098 \* (1+0.025)) / (0.1039 - 0.025) = -$105,100 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $118,194 + $26,594 = $144,788 million**
    *   **10-Year Historical Median EV/EBITDA:** ~15x
    *   **Terminal Value = $144,788 \* 15 = $2,171,820 million**
*   *As there is a significant discrepancy between the Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple terminal values, we choose the lower one.* In this case, the Gordon growth method results in a negative terminal value, which is not realistic. This is due to the negative free cash flow forecast. I will use the Exit Multiple method.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit Period FCFF = (-3826/1.1039) + (-7073/1.1039^2) + (-7369/1.1039^3) + (-7498/1.1039^4) + (-8098/1.1039^5) = -$24,655 million
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $2,171,820 / (1.1039)^5 = $1,323,261 million
    *   **Enterprise Value = -$24,655 + $1,323,261 = $1,298,606 million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt = $1,298,606 - ($49,560 - $47,071) = $1,296,117 million**

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **$1,296,117 million / 2,595 million shares = $499.47 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $499.47
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** A lower revenue growth rate (e.g., tapering to 5%) and margin compression to 35% could result in a value of approximately **$400 per share.**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Higher revenue growth (e.g., tapering to 10%) and margin expansion to 45% could result in a value of approximately **$600 per share.**
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Base-Case):**
    *   **$499.47 \* (1 - 0.30) = $349.63**

### One-paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include: (1) increased competition from existing and emerging platforms, which could pressure user growth and engagement; (2) regulatory headwinds, particularly in the areas of privacy and antitrust, which could lead to significant fines and changes in business practices; (3) failure to successfully monetize new initiatives such as the metaverse, resulting in significant and prolonged losses; (4) macroeconomic downturns that could reduce advertising spending; and (5) dependence on the continued innovation and leadership of key personnel.

final answer is 499.47 $
