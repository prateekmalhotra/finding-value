Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sally Beauty operates in the mature and fragmented beauty supply market, with a focus on hair color and care which constitute approximately 70% of sales. The company's strategy involves capturing more market share through owned brands and digital channels. However, recent performance indicates headwinds, with consolidated net sales declining 2.8% and comparable sales decreasing 1.3% in the quarter ended March 31, 2025. This negative trend, despite strategic initiatives, suggests the company is currently struggling to find a path to sizable sales increases.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear commitment to ongoing development through its stated strategic initiatives. These include growing its portfolio of owned brands like bondbar and Strawberry Leopard, expanding its digital presence through marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart.com, and testing new retail concepts such as Happy Beauty Co. The company is also focused on innovation in its professional segment, BSG, by expanding distribution for high-growth brands like Amika and Color Wow.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a specialty retailer, the company does not report traditional R&D expenditures. The closest proxy is its investment in developing owned brands. The Fiscal 2024 10-K notes that new owned brands are driving "significant growth," and these brands constitute approximately 34% of sales in the U.S. and Canada for the SBS segment. However, without specific data on the investment in this development or metrics on the success rate and revenue contribution of new products, it is not possible to verify the effectiveness of these efforts relative to the company's size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates a multi-channel sales organization, including over 4,400 stores, a network of 652 distributor sales consultants, and e-commerce platforms. Its loyalty program is a strength, with 15 million members driving 76.7% of sales in fiscal 2024. Despite these structural assets, the ultimate measure of a sales organization's effectiveness is its ability to grow revenue. The recent decline in consolidated comparable sales (-1.3% in Q2 2025) indicates that the sales organization is currently performing below average.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sally Beauty maintains a strong consolidated gross profit margin, which was 52.0% for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, an increase of 100 basis points year-over-year. This compares favorably to competitors like Ulta Beauty, whose gross margin is typically in the low-40% range. While SBH's operating margin of 7.9% is lower than Ulta's, the robust gross margin, aided by a high mix of owned brands, is certainly worthwhile.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEskapjgMv2LkOm0k9H4iqynAmzCO41uPMT0ClKXAhD6TVTbq8yo_mNpVpSXeD5yE56D6bFw-tel4TsuEwsZGzjgFc7S78_nQTFnXyUhqBLm95N_nku5nZGJxaXzUOFL72Bt1uvZqmkeeQLyPeYVQkoWOCuihXy1PEhu4tyfnQCHpQx](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEskapjgMv2LkOm0k9H4iqynAmzCO41uPMT0ClKXAhD6TVTbq8yo_mNpVpSXeD5yE56D6bFw-tel4TsuEwsZGzjgFc7S78_nQTFnXyUhqBLm95N_nku5nZGJxaXzUOFL72Bt1uvZqmkeeQLyPeYVQkoWOCuihXy1PEhu4tyfnQCHpQx) (N/A), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE45ZGMeyP2VdOCHviaFLX-d4Pz5pIVJuZoAjrL3agjznTJU5IstPPrjMZ2f9z1Jv1_rcXpUPzU16Ih3ADcyisPXJSXW47Ww5wcx9lLaJfFmeUmIx9HadjQKDl-8HMM4Gj58FgC6WKR6g-aXoTsclg=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE45ZGMeyP2VdOCHviaFLX-d4Pz5pIVJuZoAjrL3agjznTJU5IstPPrjMZ2f9z1Jv1_rcXpUPzU16Ih3ADcyisPXJSXW47Ww5wcx9lLaJfFmeUmIx9HadjQKDl-8HMM4Gj58FgC6WKR6g-aXoTsclg=) (N/A)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively implementing a "Fuel for Growth" initiative aimed at generating cost savings and modernizing the business. Specific actions include optimizing the supply chain through pooled distribution and changing store shipping frequency, which has lowered transportation costs. These efforts are yielding results, as evidenced by the 100 basis point improvement in gross margin and 130 basis point improvement in operating margin in the most recent quarter.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K provides a detailed "Human Capital Management" section that points to positive personnel relations. It notes that its U.S. and Canadian workforce is approximately 90% women and 50% people of color, and highlights competitive benefits including paid parental leave. The company also states it has been recognized by Newsweek as one of "America's Greatest Workplaces for Diversity" and "America's Greatest Workplaces for Women," providing third-party validation of its efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current President and CEO, Denise Paulonis, has held the role since October 2021, indicating stability in the top position. A review of the executive team listed in public filings does not suggest recent high-level turnover or instability. This stability at the senior level is a positive indicator of executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Public filings list the key executive officers, including the CEO, CFO, and Chief Accounting Officer. However, the documents lack detailed information regarding the tenure and experience of the broader management team or specific succession planning for key roles. Without this evidence, it is difficult to confirm that the company has sufficient management depth beyond the named executives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and also concluded that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. This clean bill of health from a major accounting firm is strong evidence of good accounting controls. The company also provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for reasonable cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sally Beauty's business model provides several unique competitive advantages. The combination of a retail business aimed at consumers (SBS) and a professional distribution business (BSG) creates scale and reach that is difficult to replicate. The high penetration of owned brands within SBS (34% of sales) provides a significant margin advantage. Furthermore, BSG's exclusive distribution rights for certain professional brands create a moat that protects its market share with stylists and salons.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is pursuing several long-term initiatives that require upfront investment, such as the "Fuel for Growth" supply chain modernization and the testing of the new "Happy Beauty Co." store concept. These programs are designed to create a more efficient and profitable company in the long run, even as the company navigates current sales challenges. This willingness to invest in multi-year strategic projects demonstrates a long-range outlook on profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017024127217/sbh-20240930.htm) (November 14, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial policy strongly favors returning capital to shareholders over issuing new equity. For the six months ended March 31, 2025, the company generated $84.5 million in cash from operations and spent $20.2 million repurchasing its own stock. The company has an ongoing share repurchase program with approximately $500.8 million remaining authorized as of March 31, 2025. This demonstrates a clear ability and intent to fund operations and growth without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1368458/000095017025069145/sbh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company's SEC filings are detailed and provide transparent segment and financial data, a full assessment of management's candor requires a qualitative review of their unscripted remarks in forums like earnings call Q&A sessions. Recent earnings call transcripts were not accessible for this review. Without direct evidence of how management communicates during challenging periods, such as the current sales downturn, it is not possible to confirm this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's most recent 10-K and a search for recent material litigation did not reveal any governance red flags or legal issues that would call the integrity of the current management into question. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 10-K is routine, and other discovered issues, such as a securities investigation announcement from 2020 and a data breach from 2015, are either dated or have not resulted in findings of wrongdoing by current management that are disclosed as material.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Sally Beauty Holdings exhibits several strong Fisher characteristics, notably its industry-leading gross margins, well-defined strategies for margin improvement and product development, and a solid financial position that allows it to return capital to shareholders. Its unique dual-channel business model and high mix of proprietary brands provide a competitive moat. However, the company scores poorly on points related to growth and execution. The primary negative is the current lack of sales growth, which calls into question the effectiveness of the sales organization and the near-term market potential. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of its turnaround initiatives. Evidence that the "Customer Centricity" and "Owned Brands" strategies are successfully reversing the negative comparable sales trend would be the most critical factor to flip "No" answers on runway and the sales organization to "Yes". Furthermore, greater disclosure on the economics of new brand development could improve the score on R&D effectiveness.

fisher score is 9 / 15
