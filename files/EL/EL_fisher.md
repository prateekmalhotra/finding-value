Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024; Form 10-Q for quarterly period ended March 31, 2025; Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript dated May 1, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Estée Lauder Companies (ELC) operates in the global prestige beauty market, a sector with long-term growth drivers including rising middle classes in emerging markets and premiumization trends. ELC’s strategy involves a diverse portfolio of brands across luxury and prestige price points, including powerhouse brands in skincare (La Mer) and fragrance (Le Labo), and scaling brands like The Ordinary. The company is focused on high-growth areas like luxury fragrance and is expanding its consumer reach, exemplified by the recent launch of nine brands in Amazon's U.S. Premium Beauty store. However, recent performance has been hampered by significant headwinds in Asia travel retail and softness in mainland China, which have led to sales declines and inventory resets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ELC demonstrates a strong commitment to new product development and market expansion. The company’s strategy is built on innovating from its iconic "hero" products while launching new items to attract consumers. Recent strategic actions include the full acquisition of DECIEM (parent of The Ordinary) in May 2024 and the 2023 acquisition of the TOM FORD brand, signaling a focus on adding high-growth assets to its portfolio. Furthermore, the "Beauty Reimagined" strategic vision, mentioned in the latest earnings report, aims to create "transformative innovation" and boost consumer-facing investments to accelerate growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ELC's research and development spending was $360 million in fiscal 2024, representing approximately 2.3% of net sales ($15.6 billion). This is lower than key competitor L'Oréal, which spent 3.2% of sales (€1.02 billion on €32.28 billion sales) on R&D in 2021. While ELC maintains a portfolio of brands known for high-performance formulas, such as Estée Lauder's Advanced Night Repair, the lower relative R&D spend suggests a focus on marketing and acquisition-led innovation rather than purely organic R&D. The company describes its R&D group as working to "improve, redesign or reformulate existing products" in addition to developing new ones.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024), 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHXyKQ5m2onans6HlbMUeiRH68TXcdCS86Dxm74lgl0xCY3EDOeqUDmyak9SN1IOwp3NZsCnyFrQ3EQ8EJzdm8KLrompPNcuxyHyZWjCswYMGNwmGgWVWI-ju3YICGkUfu4VKgSIusId3nJOYIwRw1cpKB3ZiJc58aiYn9i0fgQ9exYiWCS4tVSdUwR487Jgqkr3dFMr9pHyjWzvsu3TN7QiqnowcbSIWEyRZ6LfzNZLV2lIZQ57Sl68cHdzuSTADg=' (April 21, 2022)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ELC has a sophisticated global distribution network across approximately 150 countries, utilizing a mix of channels including travel retail, specialty-multi stores (e.g., Sephora), department stores, freestanding stores, and e-commerce. The company has historically demonstrated strength in the high-margin travel retail channel, a key brand-building and profitability driver. However, recent results show significant challenges and sales declines in this channel, particularly in Asia, due to inventory resets and changing retailer strategies. While the company is adapting by expanding online, including with Amazon, the severe disruption in a core channel suggests its sales organization, while extensive, is facing significant challenges.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ELC's profitability has been under severe pressure. The reported operating margin for fiscal 2024 was 6.2%, a sharp decline from 9.5% in fiscal 2023 and 17.9% in fiscal 2022. The most recent quarterly report for the period ending March 31, 2025, shows a gross margin of 75.0% and an operating margin of 8.6%. While gross margins remain high, the operating margin is well below its historical levels and lags key competitor L'Oréal, which consistently maintains a higher margin profile. The significant drop in profitability, driven by sales deleverage and impairments, indicates margins are not currently at a worthwhile level relative to the company's prestige positioning and historical performance.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024), 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEu5e7r_eY21WeJbDCTJV_OWTEpbBhPk8vRpFgz9fqU0C-MkFt81Wp-7CMICRJK_Aw9eOFXCmU_JjBgywlOj9_ayzAI8ab-gP8eIT38P1f_7oTdEueoWSt9YkZxuq2ZgYUwf4VBpRr6f1r5jvHmuRC44INh0C60jwsPtRiHdt5RXeDteB0q6Hgr1yZBYA==' (January 9, 2023)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has launched a comprehensive "Profit Recovery and Growth Plan" (PRGP) for fiscal years 2025 and 2026. This plan is the central initiative to restore margins and is focused on improving gross margin, lowering the cost base, and reducing overheads. As part of the PRGP, a restructuring program is underway which includes a net reduction of 5,800 to 7,000 positions and is expected to result in restructuring charges of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion. Once fully implemented, the PRGP is expected to yield annual gross benefits of between $800 million and $1,000 million, with the goal of returning to a double-digit operating margin.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K notes that as of June 30, 2024, it had approximately 62,000 employees with a limited number outside the U.S. covered by works council agreements. The company emphasizes its commitment to an inclusive and diverse workplace in its filings and public statements. However, the ongoing PRGP includes a significant workforce reduction of 9-11% of its global positions as of June 30, 2023. Such a large-scale reduction, while aimed at improving profitability, creates uncertainty and can negatively impact employee morale and relations, precluding a classification of "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ELC is a family-controlled company, with members of the Lauder family holding key roles, including Executive Chairman (William P. Lauder) and various board and executive positions. This structure provides a high degree of stability and long-term vision. The executive team is a mix of long-tenured leaders and external hires. As of August 2024, the company announced that a new CFO, Akhil Shrivastava, would succeed Tracey T. Travis, indicating active succession planning. The continued presence and influence of the founding family ensures strong alignment and stability at the highest levels.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public filings list a deep bench of senior executives beyond the CEO, including Executive Group Presidents and leaders for international markets, global supply chain, and R&D. For example, Stéphane de La Faverie serves as Executive Group President, and Peter Jueptner is President, International, highlighting a layer of senior leadership with broad responsibility. The recent CFO transition appears to be an internal promotion, suggesting the company develops talent from within. The presence of experienced leaders across key functions and geographies indicates sufficient management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ELC's fiscal 2024 10-K includes "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting," which concludes that as of June 30, 2024, the company's internal controls were effective. This assessment was audited by the independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company provides detailed segment data by product category and geographic region, demonstrating robust internal reporting. There is no recent history of major restatements noted.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the prestige beauty industry, brand equity and distribution are paramount. ELC's key competitive strength is its portfolio of globally recognized prestige and luxury brands, which it stewards through carefully managed, image-enhancing distribution channels. A core component of this has been its leadership in the global travel retail channel, which offers high margins and exposure to a global consumer base. While currently facing headwinds, this channel has historically been a significant advantage. The company's ability to manage a multi-brand portfolio, from icons like Estée Lauder to modern growth engines like The Ordinary, is a crucial and distinctive capability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's commitment to the multi-year Profit Recovery and Growth Plan is the strongest evidence of its long-range profit outlook. Management is incurring significant near-term restructuring charges ($1.2B to $1.6B) and undertaking major operational changes, including workforce reductions, with the explicit goal of rebuilding margins in fiscal 2025 and 2026 and achieving long-term sustainable profitability. This demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice short-term earnings for a more durable and profitable long-term structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, the company had a strong liquidity position with $2.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It generated $2.36 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2024. While total debt was $7.8 billion, the company has a history of accessing debt markets and maintains investment-grade credit ratings (A1 from Moody's, A from S&P as of August 2024). The company has suspended its share repurchase program, prioritizing cash for operational needs, but has a long history of returning capital to shareholders rather than issuing shares. The financial position appears robust enough to fund operations, capital expenditures, and the PRGP without dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent filings and earnings calls demonstrate a high degree of candor regarding the company's significant challenges. The MD&A sections of the 10-K and 10-Q provide detailed explanations for the sales declines in Asia travel retail and mainland China, retailer destocking, and subdued consumer sentiment. The company has also been transparent about the significant impairment charges related to the Dr.Jart+, TOM FORD, and Too Faced brands, detailing the specific triggers and financial impact. Reviewing the Q3 2025 earnings call transcript from May 1, 2025, management openly addressed the difficult operating environment and the progress of its recovery plan.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/EL/transcripts/2025/3/' (May 1, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a formal Code of Conduct and a clean auditor's opinion on its financial statements and internal controls. However, the company is facing a purported securities class action complaint alleging materially false and misleading statements, which the company intends to defend vigorously. It has also recorded a $159 million charge for talcum litigation settlement agreements related to claims that certain products were contaminated with asbestos. While legal challenges are not uncommon for a company of this size, active securities litigation and product safety settlements prevent a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity at this time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125025000060/el-20250331.htm' (May 1, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm' (August 19, 2024)]

Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. scores positively on many of Fisher's qualitative points, particularly those related to long-term strategy, management stability, financial strength, and investor transparency. The family-controlled structure provides a stable, long-range outlook, which is evident in the company's commitment to its comprehensive, albeit costly, Profit Recovery and Growth Plan aimed at restoring historical profitability. However, the analysis reveals significant current operational weaknesses, reflected in deteriorating profit margins, challenged sales organization performance in the critical Asia travel retail channel, and relatively low R&D spending compared to peers. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the execution and success of the PRGP. A successful turnaround that restores operating margins to double-digit levels would flip "Worthwhile Profit Margins" to Yes. Similarly, sustained recovery and growth in the Asia travel retail channel would be required to change the "Above-Average Sales Organization" score to Yes.

fisher score is 9 / 15
