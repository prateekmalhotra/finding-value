### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the current stock price to determine the growth and profitability assumptions embedded within it.

**Current Market Price**
As of August 21, 2025, the closing market price for KHC was **$27.50**.

**Baseline Financials (TTM)**
The following table presents the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) financials for the period ended June 28, 2025.

| Diluted W.A. Shares | 1,198 | (10-Q, March 29, 2025) |

**Market-Implied Assumptions**
To justify the current market price of $27.50 per share, the market must believe Kraft Heinz will achieve a specific level of future performance. By holding the operating margin stable at the TTM level of 21.0% and using a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, the model solves for the required revenue growth.

*   **The market is pricing in a 5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 1.5%.** This level of growth, when combined with stable margins, is necessary to support the current valuation. This implies a belief in a sustained, albeit slow, recovery and growth trajectory for the company's top line.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent, conservative estimate of intrinsic value based on evidence from primary sources and realistic assumptions.

**Forecast & Assumptions**
My assumptions are formulated to be conservative and grounded in the company's recent performance and stated expectations.

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** I am projecting a **0.5% annual revenue growth rate** for the next five years. This is more conservative than the market-implied 1.5%. Recent performance shows revenue declines, and management commentary from earnings calls focuses more on portfolio optimization and margin improvement than aggressive top-line growth. A near-flat revenue projection reflects the challenges in the packaged foods industry and the company's ongoing transformation.
*   **Operating Margin:** I will use an average operating margin of **20.0%**. This is slightly below the TTM margin of 21.0% but aligns with the historical average when excluding one-time impairment charges. Without specific management guidance on significant margin expansion from new initiatives, assuming a slight compression from the recent high is a conservative approach.
*   **Taxes:** I will use an effective tax rate of **26.1%**, as guided by the company in its latest 10-Q for the 2025 fiscal year. (10-Q, April 29, 2025).
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled at **3.8% of revenue**, consistent with the 3-year historical average (TTM Capex $906M / TTM Revenue $25,310M = 3.6%).
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled at **0.5% of incremental revenue**, reflecting efficient working capital management.
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:** I project a net **1.0% annual reduction in shares outstanding**. The company has an active $3.0 billion share repurchase program, of which $1.7 billion remained as of March 29, 2025 (10-Q, April 29, 2025). This assumption balances the authorized buybacks against dilution from stock-based compensation.

**Free Cash Flow Build**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
*Formula: FCFF = NOPAT + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC (where NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate))*

| (USD Millions) | Base (TTM) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $25,310 | $25,436.55 | $25,563.73 | $25,691.55 | $25,820.01 | $25,949.11 |
| EBIT (20.0% margin) | $5,322 | $5,087.31 | $5,112.75 | $5,138.31 | $5,163.99 | $5,189.79 |
| NOPAT | $3,932 | $3,759.50 | $3,778.61 | $3,797.79 | $3,817.04 | $3,836.36 |
| D&A | $951 | $951.00 | $951.00 | $951.00 | $951.00 | $951.00 |
| Stock-Based Comp | -$97 | -$97.00 | -$97.00 | -$97.00 | -$97.00 | -$97.00 |
| Capex | -$906 | -$966.59 | -$971.52 | -$976.48 | -$981.47 | -$986.49 |
| Change in NWC | -$188 | -$0.63 | -$0.64 | -$0.64 | -$0.64 | -$0.64 |
| **FCFF** | | **$3,646.28** | **$3,660.45** | **$3,674.67** | **$3,688.89** | **$3,702.97** |

**Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.33%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium (ERP): **5.0%**. This is a standard, widely accepted premium for the U.S. market.
    *   Beta (Î²): **0.33**. This 3-year beta reflects KHC's lower volatility compared to the overall market, which is characteristic of a mature consumer staples company.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.33% + 0.33 * 5.0% = **5.98%***
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Average Debt = $926M / $21,211M = **4.365%**.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.365% * (1 - 26.1%) = **3.226%**.
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: $32,945M ($27.50 price * 1,198M shares)
    *   Market Value of Debt: $21,603M
    *   Enterprise Value (E+D): $54,548M
    *   *WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd) = (60.4% * 5.98%) + (39.6% * 3.226%) = **4.89%***

**Terminal Value**
The terminal value is calculated using the Gordon Growth method and cross-checked with an exit multiple approach.

*   **Gordon Growth:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This is a realistic long-term growth assumption, capped at the long-run inflation expectation.
    *   *Terminal Value = FCFF_Year5 * (1+g) / (WACC - g) = $3,702.97 * (1.025) / (4.89% - 2.5%) = **$158,809M***
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $5,189.79M + $951M = $6,140.79M.
    *   The 5-year average EV/EBITDA multiple for KHC is **10.1x**.
    *   *Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $6,140.79M * 10.0x = **$61,408M***
*   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth method implies an exit EV/EBITDA multiple of ($158,809M / $6,140.79M) = **25.9x**, which is unrealistically high for a low-growth consumer staples company. The historical median multiple is a more realistic reflection of the company's value. I will therefore use the Terminal Value derived from a **10.0x EV/EBITDA multiple**, which is in line with the historical average.

**Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Calculation | Amount (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of 5-Year FCFF | $15,791 |
| PV of Terminal Value ($61,408M @ 10x EBITDA) | $48,319 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$64,110** |
| Less: Net Debt | -$19,490 |
| **Equity Value** | **$44,620** |

**Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Shares Outstanding (Year 5): 1,139M (1,198M * (1-0.01)^5)
    *   *Value per Share = Equity Value / Projected Shares = $44,620M / 1,139M = **$39.17***
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $39.17**. Assumes 0.5% revenue growth and 20.0% operating margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $32.07**. Assumes -1.0% revenue decline and 19.0% operating margins. (Approx. 18.1% below Base Case)
    *   **High/Bull Case: $46.38**. Assumes 1.5% revenue growth and 21.0% operating margins. (Approx. 18.4% above Base Case)
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% margin of safety from the base-case fair value provides a target purchase price.
    *   *MOS Price = $39.17 * (1 - 0.25) = **$29.38***

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Commodity Price Volatility:** Kraft Heinz is heavily exposed to fluctuations in the prices of key inputs like dairy, meat, and coffee. Failure to hedge effectively or pass on costs could significantly compress margins.
2.  **Changing Consumer Preferences:** There is a persistent shift away from processed, center-of-the-aisle foods towards fresher, private-label, and healthier alternatives. KHC's ability to innovate and adapt its portfolio is critical to maintaining market share.
3.  **High Debt Load:** The company still carries a significant amount of debt from the Kraft and Heinz merger. This reduces financial flexibility and makes the company sensitive to changes in interest rates.
4.  **Retailer Concentration:** KHC relies on a small number of large retail customers (e.g., Walmart). The loss of a key customer or pressure on pricing from these large retailers could adversely affect revenue and profitability.
5.  **Brand Value Impairment:** The company's value is heavily reliant on its brand portfolio. Further write-downs of goodwill or intangible assets are possible if the performance of key brands deteriorates.

final answer is 39.17 $
