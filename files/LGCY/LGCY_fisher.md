Here is the analysis of Legacy Education Inc. (LGCY) based on Philip A. Fisher’s 15-point checklist.

**Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed.**
Legacy Education Inc. (LGCY), August 22, 2025. Primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed on October 1, 2024; Form 10-Q filed on May 15, 2025; and earnings call transcripts for Q1, Q2, and Q3 of fiscal year 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Legacy Education operates in the healthcare education sector, which is projected to grow significantly. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects healthcare industry employment to grow 16% from 2020 to 2030, creating over 2.6 million new jobs, driven by an aging population. LGCY is expanding its program offerings, including new associate and bachelor's degrees, and is opening new campuses to meet this demand. The company's revenue increased by 50.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, driven by a 49.8% increase in student enrollment.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a stated growth strategy of launching new program offerings, including online programs, opening new branch campuses, and acquiring new institutions. The company recently acquired Contra Costa Medical Career College in December 2024 and is in the process of obtaining approvals for new programs, such as an Associate Degree in Nursing at its Central Coast College campus. These actions demonstrate a clear commitment to expanding their educational offerings and geographic footprint.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an education provider, LGCY's "R&D" is in curriculum and program development rather than traditional product R&D. The company does not report R&D spending as a separate line item. However, their effectiveness can be measured by the successful launch of new, accredited programs that meet market demand. The company has a track record of adding new programs and campuses, which have contributed to significant revenue and enrollment growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "sales organization" is its marketing and recruiting team. LGCY has demonstrated strong results in student recruitment, with a 70.7% increase in new student starts for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, compared to the prior year. Their marketing strategy integrates digital and traditional media with a strong referral program, which accounts for approximately 36% of new enrollments. This indicates an effective and well-rounded approach to student acquisition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the three months ended March 31, 2025, Legacy Education reported an operating income margin of 19.7% and a net income margin of 15.2%. These margins represent an improvement over the same period in the prior year. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, the company reported an operating margin of 13.5% and a net margin of 11.1%. These are strong profit margins for a company in a growth phase.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is focused on growing enrollment, which allows them to leverage their existing infrastructure and improve margins. The recent acquisition of CCMCC is expected to contribute to this growth. While specific margin improvement initiatives are not detailed, the company's ability to increase revenue faster than expenses, as seen in the most recent quarterly report, indicates effective cost management and operating leverage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings do not indicate any significant labor-related issues. As of June 30, 2024, none of the company's employees were party to any collective bargaining agreements. The filings do not provide detailed metrics on employee turnover or engagement, so a definitive assessment is difficult. However, there are no red flags to suggest poor labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, including the CEO and CFO, have been with the company for several years, indicating stability. The CEO is also the founder, which suggests a strong commitment to the company's long-term success. There is no evidence of executive turnover or disputes in the filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a named executive team beyond the CEO, including a CFO and a Chief Academic Officer. The company also has campus-level management for its different institutions. While the filings do not provide extensive detail on succession planning, the presence of a multi-person executive team suggests a degree of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides segmented financial data for its educational services and general and administrative expenses. The auditor's report in the 10-K does not raise any concerns about internal controls. The company's timely and detailed financial reporting suggests adequate accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key factor in the for-profit education industry is regulatory compliance and accreditation. Legacy Education has maintained its accreditations and eligibility for Title IV federal financial aid programs. The company's 90/10 revenue test results are within the required limits, a critical metric for proprietary schools. Strong student outcomes, such as an average placement rate of 78% as of June 30, 2024, also serve as a competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy of investing in new programs, campuses, and acquisitions points to a long-range outlook. These investments, such as the acquisition of CCMCC, require upfront costs but are expected to drive long-term growth and profitability. The company's willingness to make these investments, even as a newly public company, suggests a focus on sustainable, long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, the company had $17.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and positive operating cash flow of $4.8 million for the nine months then ended. The company recently completed an IPO in September 2024, which provided significant capital. While the company may use equity in future acquisitions, its current financial position appears strong enough to fund organic growth without significant dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is newly public, so there is a limited track record of investor communications. However, the earnings call transcripts available show a willingness to discuss challenges and risks. The MD&A section of the SEC filings provides a detailed overview of the business, including risks and regulatory challenges. There is no evidence of a lack of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LGCY/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no legal proceedings or regulatory actions mentioned in the filings that would question the integrity of the management team. The company has a related-party transaction policy in place. There are no red flags in the available documents to suggest a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm']

---
**Synthesis**
Legacy Education Inc. scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strong growth potential, a committed management team, and solid financial performance. The company's focus on the high-demand healthcare education sector, coupled with a clear strategy for expansion through new programs and acquisitions, provides a long runway for growth. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful integration of acquisitions like CCMCC, the ability to maintain strong student outcomes and regulatory compliance, and the continued improvement of profit margins as the company scales. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosures on employee satisfaction and turnover, which would provide a clearer picture of personnel stability.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
