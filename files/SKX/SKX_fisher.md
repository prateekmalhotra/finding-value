Skechers U.S.A., Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K, Q2 2025 Form 10-Q.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers holds the position of the third-largest athletic footwear company globally. The company has demonstrated consistent growth, achieving record annual sales of $8.97 billion in 2024, a 12.1% increase year-over-year, and has a near-term goal of reaching $10 billion in sales by 2026. Growth is supported by international expansion, with international sales accounting for 62% of total sales in 2024, up from 34% in 2014, and growing at a 21% compounded annual rate since 2014. The company is expanding its product lines into new performance categories like soccer, basketball, and cricket, and its Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) segment continues to grow, representing approximately 39% of total revenue.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers demonstrates a strong commitment to new product development by continuously expanding its performance lines, recently launching products for soccer, basketball, and cricket. The company emphasizes its identity as a "comfort technology company," and its website lists 14 different footwear technologies. Recent successful innovations like "Hands Free Slip-ins" and podiatrist-certified "Arch Fit" shoes highlight this focus. Capital expenditures for 2024 were $416.8 million, with a significant portion invested in retail stores, direct-to-consumer technologies, and distribution infrastructure to support growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG6GqrnYYMnGTSPlpRAK-QNejdGQB9frkS4yVD15aZ4ronRRkoG7MUm9tFPwMZ2nkEErMSxgsDF7i_QpQlzxV2DBcZxTjUo4SAhX9faDqBcvlN4SJPZ0Pqud7YbsvzFhUAgaqWT5VtAMbexTlJ1Vc41nSssN7FrLzj1XOrR9-8YKKqqQskWa6XRaSAszUPW7ANC_MlTus3JWEt6h82JktwSSnjck43tMdi8wlm9fGmJVxYXNDvJpw==] (July 24, 2024)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers' R&D expenses appear low relative to its revenue, totaling $33.9 million in 2024, which is less than 0.4% of its $8.97 billion in sales. This is significantly lower than athletic apparel and footwear industry averages. While the company does not disclose specific metrics on the output of its R&D spending, its continuous rollout of new technologies like "Hands Free Slip-ins" and "Arch Fit" and its expansion into new performance categories suggest a focus on product innovation. However, without more detailed data on R&D productivity or a direct comparison to competitor spending as a percentage of revenue, the effectiveness is difficult to quantify as "above-average."
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers utilizes a multi-channel distribution strategy, with a mix of wholesale (57%) and direct-to-consumer (43%) sales. The company has a significant global retail presence with 5,296 stores worldwide as of December 31, 2024, of which 1,787 are company-owned. This large physical footprint, which surpasses that of major competitors like Nike, allows for broad consumer reach. The company’s growth in both wholesale (13.2% in 2024) and DTC (10.7% in 2024) channels suggests an effective sales organization that can manage diverse retail partnerships and a large direct retail network.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG6GqrnYYMnGTSPlpRAK-QNejdGQB9frkS4yVD15aZ4ronRRkoG7MUm9tFPwMZ2nkEErMSxgsDF7i_QpQlzxV2DBcZxTjUo4SAhX9faDqBcvlN4SJPZ0Pqud7YbsvzFhUAgaqWT5VtAMbexTlJ1Vc41nSssN7FrLzj1XOrR9-8YKKqqQskWa6XRaSAszUPW7ANC_MlTus3JWEt6h82JktwSSnjck43tMdi8wlm9fGmJVxYXNDvJpw==] (July 24, 2024), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGgSL6EAB1ru-54wf0-r-o43bnvcV5a60ItNmvGIEYYzI6a43WVTRhCRbJ8aREj8l-kKcYGlLcZiqtB9ScbGgq3_7mNWYAwNzWPJDmZU63vF45idpoS7pfM78pdrFkErD7m1lnz6xUPUMXA-7rMmZ7MbRJGZ1R-JzAvv11xn77uwTxB74Tv_enI2lYf0SaET_2ze_dxi6rU] (March 27, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Skechers reported a gross margin of 53.2% and an operating margin of 10.1%. While the gross margin is strong for the industry, the operating margin is more moderate. For comparison, in their most recent fiscal years, Nike reported a gross margin of 44.3% and an operating margin of 11.5%, while Deckers Outdoor reported a gross margin of 55.6% and an operating margin of 20.2%. Skechers' net profit margin in 2024 was 7.1%. While the company's margins are not at the top of its peer group, they are substantial and have been improving.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SKX/skechers-usa/net-profit-margin](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/SKX/skechers-usa/net-profit-margin) (2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers is focused on improving its profit margins through several initiatives. A key strategy is the continued expansion of its Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) segment, which has higher operating margins (estimated at 18%) compared to its wholesale segment (estimated at 7.5%). In 2024, gross margin improved to 53.2% from 51.9% in the prior year, primarily due to lower freight costs. The company is also making significant investments in its distribution infrastructure, with planned expansions in North America, China, and Europe, which are expected to improve operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHj9UNLcUWSV39_MjvgMytxdnCmoIliPht6stdLYYnXYer8fvVhexV6r3PJIBS8woqdVJ9J6S-0IPXiHyfthptmTLoOVRDFvM6FjXdRegt1iu1mG873PMJvQG8Gv7Z7ypdpr-AlURLScargFRgJ-1Nt_VLjcXfwKehK258Ol4Lj74UU_9mDqOp8-HbKkdMcczo2ozmr1Hkyhon2S2jHvP5HIW3ivNIz3m1DVL2uRh0vW8U=] (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers emphasizes a "family brand" culture and a philosophy of treating its approximately 20,100 employees with care and respect. The company's Corporate Code of Conduct and Supplier Code of Conduct outline its commitment to human rights, non-discrimination, and safe working conditions. The company offers competitive benefits packages that include parental leave, retirement savings, and health and fitness programs. However, there is no publicly available data on employee turnover rates, engagement scores, or union relations to definitively assess the quality of labor relations as "outstanding" compared to peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](httpshttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGTK3PWIJhzqVSSOJscmOQSOhan1Jp79NUC_4JB13YMYML4ugJLRC1M5G_8Yy1N_ntKlGqsMlajIOKZpjqRL9KwJIJ-Jbpv-k6qXImk99Aj8Q9U2CRvlWWhpQ2qjjObnUfvp95tMMaX7f8M_NSU5rHBtMug7tAmwm4uLP5HodL1b5Lg0yepATyfDgck1XPDIWizJ8jIFLbVt6s3ZbRHM-dWOZ_6jnnaGd1bzImqG7AoCiXA_sDH5G0w6DK8br1q6Ow==] (2022), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHC0Wsu3RtGrjinin3mkjTgn_kFQcCRo--6UYOZYUr3ipmnWKBqRu_y8n9dxiE0C7cRjYY8Oo9XoRa4tjQcl5-uZvMFtgxKbsTSA8DCsbG_j0wkEYvW2r9RdByEKG7AJj9FBEY3oLoenZigKJXN3GVx3oEj78qryMnkXGdJY6MHjKfqRX7eJr879PUye_xHdIw=] (2022)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's senior management team has been stable for many years, with Robert Greenberg (Chairman and CEO), Michael Greenberg (President), and David Weinberg (EVP and COO) having been with the company since its early days. This long tenure suggests a cohesive and stable executive team. The Greenberg family has a significant ownership stake in the company, which aligns their interests with those of other shareholders. The company’s consistent growth and profitability under this leadership team further support the idea of strong executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the top executive team has a long and successful track record, the concentration of control and long tenure of the founding family members raises questions about management depth and succession planning. Robert Greenberg, the CEO, and his son, Michael Greenberg, the President, hold key leadership roles. The 2024 10-K does not provide significant detail on the broader management team or formal succession plans. While the company has a large and global operation, which implies a layer of management below the executive team, there is not enough publicly available information to confirm the depth and strength of this team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers' financial statements are audited by a reputable firm, BDO USA, P.C., and the company has consistently filed its financial reports on time. The 2024 10-K includes a report from management on internal control over financial reporting, stating that controls are effective. The company provides segment reporting for its Wholesale and Direct-to-Consumer businesses, offering some transparency into its operations. There is no recent history of major restatements or accounting scandals. However, without more granular detail on their internal cost analysis processes, it is difficult to definitively assess their capabilities as "outstanding."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for Skechers is its focus on the "comfort" segment of the footwear market, a space it largely dominates. The company's ability to offer a wide range of comfortable and stylish footwear at a value price point has allowed it to capture a significant market share, particularly among consumers who prioritize comfort over performance. This positioning distinguishes it from competitors like Nike and Adidas, who are more focused on athletic performance. The company’s large and growing network of retail stores also provides a significant competitive advantage in terms of brand visibility and direct customer engagement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG6GqrnYYMnGTSPlpRAK-QNejdGQB9frkS4yVD15aZ4ronRRkoG7MUm9tFPwMZ2nkEErMSxgsDF7i_QpQlzxV2DBcZxTjUo4SAhX9faDqBcvlN4SJPZ0Pqud7YbsvzFhUAgaqWT5VtAMbexTlJ1Vc41nSssN7FrLzj1XOrR9-8YKKqqQskWa6XRaSAszUPW7ANC_MlTus3JWEt6h82JktwSSnjck43tMdi8wlm9fGmJVxYXNDvJpw==] (July 24, 2024), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHj9UNLcUWSV39_MjvgMytxdnCmoIliPht6stdLYYnXYer8fvVhexV6r3PJIBS8woqdVJ9J6S-0IPXiHyfthptmTLoOVRDFvM6FjXdRegt1iu1mG873PMJvQG8Gv7Z7ypdpr-AlURLScargFRgJ-1Nt_VLjcXfwKehK258Ol4Lj74UU_9mDqOp8-HbKkdMcczo2ozmr1Hkyhon2S2jHvP5HIW3ivNIz3m1DVL2uRh0vW8U=] (May 5, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGgSL6EAB1ru-54wf0-r-o43bnvcV5a60ItNmvGIEYYzI6a43WVTRhCRbJ8aREj8l-kKcYGlLcZiqtB9ScbGgq3_7mNWYAwNzWPJDmZU63vF45idpoS7pfM78pdrFkErD7m1lnz6xUPUMXA-7rMmZ7MbRJGZ1R-JzAvv11xn77uwTxB74Tv_enI2lYf0SaET_2ze_dxi6rU] (March 27, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers' strategy of investing heavily in international expansion and building out its global distribution infrastructure points to a long-range outlook. The company has set a long-term sales goal of $10 billion by 2026, indicating a focus on future growth. The company's consistent investment in marketing and brand building, even during periods of economic uncertainty, also suggests a long-term perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://dcfmodeling.com/breaking-down-skechers-u-s-a-inc-s-skx-financial-health-key-insights-for-investors] (2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Skechers had $1.38 billion in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of $2.5 billion. The company has a share repurchase program in place, having repurchased $303 million of shares in 2024, which demonstrates a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them. Net cash provided by operating activities was $687.4 million in 2024, providing a strong source of internal funding for growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025105871/skx-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025105871/skx-20250630.htm) (August 8, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGgSL6EAB1ru-54wf0-r-o43bnvcV5a60ItNmvGIEYYzI6a43WVTRhCRbJ8aREj8l-kKcYGlLcZiqtB9ScbGgq3_7mNWYAwNzWPJDmZU63vF45idpoS7pfM78pdrFkErD7m1lnz6xUPUMXA-7rMmZ7MbRJGZ1R-JzAvv11xn77uwTxB74Tv_enI2lYf0SaET_2ze_dxi6rU] (March 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers' management team regularly hosts quarterly earnings calls and participates in investor conferences, providing a consistent channel of communication with investors. The transcripts of these calls show a willingness to discuss both positive and negative aspects of the business, including challenges in specific markets or product lines. The company’s investor relations website provides access to SEC filings, press releases, and other relevant information. While it is difficult to definitively assess the level of candor without being an investor and having direct interactions, the available information suggests a commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of recent, significant legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of the company's management. A derivative lawsuit filed in 2022 against certain members of the Board of Directors regarding the personal use of company aircraft was dismissed with prejudice in February 2025. The company has a Code of Ethics and Corporate Code of Conduct that apply to all employees and directors. There are no other major red flags in the company's recent history to suggest a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065837/000095017025030016/skx-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

---
Synthesis: Skechers scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its strongest positives being its strong brand recognition in the comfort footwear space, its long runway for growth through international expansion and new product lines, and its stable and experienced management team. The company's financials are solid, with a healthy balance sheet and strong cash flow generation. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its expansion into new performance categories, its ability to continue to improve its profit margins in the face of a competitive retail environment, and its ability to demonstrate greater management depth beyond the founding family. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" with more transparent reporting on R&D spending and productivity metrics. A "No" on management depth could be addressed through the clear articulation of a succession plan and the highlighting of the roles and responsibilities of the broader management team.

fisher score is 12 / 15
