### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** As a real estate investment trust, Sabra's business model does not exhibit network effects. The value of its properties to a tenant does not increase with the number of other tenants leasing from Sabra. The business is a collection of individual assets, not an interconnected network.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business is described as acquiring, financing, and owning real estate property to be leased to third parties. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Tenants face moderately high switching costs, primarily from the operational complexity and regulatory hurdles of relocating residents and securing new licenses for a different facility. The long-term, triple-net lease structure creates contractual lock-in, however, the weighted-average remaining lease term of seven years is moderate and prevents a higher score. Furthermore, the significant risk of tenant financial distress can lead to lease renegotiations or terminations, reducing stickiness.
**Evidence:**
*   The majority of properties are leased under triple-net operating leases with a weighted-average remaining term of seven years as of December 31, 2024. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
*   Transferring healthcare properties requires the new tenant to become licensed under state law and, in certain states, receive change-of-ownership approvals under certificate of need laws, which can cause significant delays. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** There is no evidence that Sabra possesses a structural, durable cost advantage over its competitors. The company competes with a wide range of investors, including larger REITs that may have a lower cost of capital. While Sabra's management has extensive experience, this does not translate to a quantifiable per-unit cost advantage in property acquisition or financing.
**Evidence:**
*   Sabra competes for investments with "other REITs, investment companies, private equity and hedge fund investors, sovereign funds, healthcare operators, lenders and other investors. Some of our competitors are significantly larger and have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do." (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** Sabra's primary assets are physical properties, not intangible ones like patents or brands that command pricing power. While the company cites strong relationships with its 60 operators, this is a subjective and common industry claim rather than a defensible, proprietary asset that prevents competition.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's competitive strengths are listed as its diverse portfolio, lease structure, and relationships, with no mention of patents, trademarks, or significant brand equity. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** Sabra benefits from efficient scale in certain local markets, where high capital costs and regulatory hurdles for new construction make it unprofitable for numerous competitors to operate. A portfolio of 364 properties provides a degree of scale. However, the company itself notes the "highly-fragmented nature of the skilled nursing and senior housing industries," which indicates its scale is not dominant enough to deter competition broadly.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, Sabra's portfolio consisted of 364 real estate properties. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
*   The highly-fragmented nature of the industry presents investment opportunities, implying a lack of dominant scale players. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** Sabra's business is real estate ownership and leasing, not data aggregation. There is no evidence of a proprietary dataset that creates a feedback loop to improve its assets or increase tenant retention. The company uses data for asset management, but this is standard practice and not a competitive moat.
**Evidence:**
*   The 10-K describes the business as owning and investing in real estate; there is no mention of monetizing or leveraging proprietary data as a core business component. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** This dimension is not applicable to Sabra's business model. The company does not operate a platform that connects third-party developers or service providers in a way that creates value-additive ecosystem effects. Its relationships with operators are bilateral landlord-tenant agreements.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business model is centered on direct ownership and triple-net leases or management agreements for its properties, not on a platform-based ecosystem. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** Sabra benefits from an indirect regulatory moat. Its tenants, the operators, are subject to extensive and complex federal and state laws, including Certificate of Need requirements in many states, which restrict the development of new facilities. These high regulatory hurdles for operators limit the supply of competing properties, thereby protecting the value and occupancy of Sabra's existing, licensed assets.
**Evidence:**
*   "Most states in which our tenants operate have statutes requiring that prior to the addition or construction of new nursing home beds...the tenant first must obtain a certificate of need." (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
*   Failure to comply with extensive healthcare regulations can lead to tenants becoming ineligible for reimbursement or losing their license to operate. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The business is characterized by extremely high capital intensity and asset specificity, which creates a strong barrier to entry. Healthcare facilities are expensive, single-purpose assets that cannot be easily or cheaply repurposed. This large, specialized, and illiquid investment deters new entrants from quickly building a competing portfolio.
**Evidence:**
*   "Healthcare facilities are typically highly customized and may not be easily adapted to non-healthcare-related uses. The improvements generally required to conform a property to healthcare use are costly and at times tenant-specific." (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
*   As of December 31, 2024, the gross cost of real estate assets was USD 5.6 billion. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** Sabra's triple-net lease model with a 7-year weighted average term provides a degree of predictable, recurring revenue. However, this is significantly tempered by the high credit risk of its tenants, whose profitability is heavily dependent on government reimbursement policies and vulnerable to rising labor costs. The risk of tenant defaults or rent renegotiations reduces the certainty of these long-term contracts.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, leases had a weighted-average remaining term of seven years. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
*   Risk factors highlight that tenants depend on reimbursement from governmental programs, and that "significant limits on reimbursement rates...could have a material adverse effect on their business." (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **Aggregation**
The weighted score is calculated by summing the weighted contribution of each dimension (Raw Score * Weight % / 5 * 100).
*   **Weighted Sum:** 0.0 + 9.0 + 3.0 + 2.4 + 6.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 3.6 + 3.2 + 1.2 = **28.4**
*   **Final Weighted Score:** 28.4 / 100

### **Mapping**
The weighted score is mapped to the final 0–5 moat rating based on the provided thresholds.
*   A score of 28.4 falls within the range "10 ≤ Weighted < 30," which corresponds to a moat rating of 1.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is 5–7 years. This is primarily anchored to the weighted-average remaining lease term of seven years, which provides a moderate degree of contractual revenue visibility. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025) The duration is capped at the lower end of the forecastable horizon due to the significant and persistent risks facing tenants, including potential changes in government reimbursement and rising operating costs, which could force lease renegotiations before their expiration.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Systemic Tenant Distress:** A significant reduction in Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement rates or a sustained spike in labor costs could lead to widespread tenant defaults and bankruptcies, forcing Sabra to grant rent concessions or find new operators at lower rates. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
2.  **Regulatory Easing:** The repeal of Certificate of Need (CON) laws in key states would lower barriers to entry, potentially leading to an oversupply of new, modern healthcare facilities that would compete directly with Sabra's older properties for tenants. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)
3.  **Increased Competition from Lower-Cost Capital:** A prolonged period of low interest rates could empower larger competitors or private equity firms with a lower cost of capital to bid more aggressively for assets, compressing Sabra's investment spreads and ability to grow profitably. (Sabra 2024 Form 10-K, Feb 12, 2025)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Tenant Rent Coverage (EBITDAR/Rent):** A decline indicates rising tenant financial stress.
*   **Occupancy Rates:** A persistent drop signals weakening demand or increased local competition.
*   **Weighted Average Lease Term (WALT):** A shortening WALT suggests a loss of pricing power and revenue visibility.
*   **Tenant Concentration:** An increase in reliance on a single tenant elevates risk.
*   **Net Debt to Adjusted EBITDA:** Rising leverage could constrain financial flexibility.
*   **Investment Spreads:** The difference between property acquisition yields and cost of capital is a key indicator of profitable growth potential.
*   **CMS Reimbursement Rate Changes:** Annual updates from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services directly impact tenant profitability.

### **Short Verdict**
The final rating reflects a company with limited, though not nonexistent, competitive advantages. The primary moat sources are indirect, stemming from the high barriers to entry in the healthcare industry (regulation and capital intensity) which protect incumbents from new competition. However, these strengths are counteracted by weak switching costs, a lack of proprietary assets or cost advantages, and significant exposure to the fragile financial health of its tenants. The evidence does not support a durable, wide moat, as a downturn in the healthcare operating environment would directly and negatively impact Sabra's financial results. A material increase in the weighted-average lease term to over 10 years or a significant industry consolidation resulting in dominant scale could potentially justify a higher rating.

moat rating is 1 / 5
