Of course. The provided valuation contains significant flaws, primarily in the terminal value calculation and the application of share count reduction, which lead to a drastically overestimated fair value.

Here is a revised and corrected analysis that maintains the original format, addresses the identified issues, and grounds the assumptions in a more realistic context for the grocery industry.

| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 582.3 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ended Jun 14, 2025 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market's implied assumptions, we first calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and then determine the revenue growth rate required to justify the current stock price, holding the TTM operating margin constant.

*   **Discount Rate (WACC) Calculation:**
    *   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
        *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
        *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (Standard market assumption).
        *   Beta (5-Year): 0.30. A beta below 1.0 is justified as it reflects the non-cyclical, staple nature of the grocery business, which is less volatile than the overall market. (Finbox, August 23, 2025).
        *   *Formula: Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta \* Equity Risk Premium*
        *   Calculation: 4.26% + 0.30 \* 5.0% = **5.76%**
    *   **Cost of Debt:**
        *   *Formula: Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt*
        *   Calculation: $467M / $7,417M = 6.29%
        *   After-Tax Cost of Debt (assuming 21% tax rate): 6.29% \* (1 - 0.21) = **4.97%**
    *   **WACC Calculation:**
        *   Market Capitalization: $19.52/share \* 582.3M shares = $11,366M
        *   Enterprise Value (EV): $11,366M + $7,417M - $151M = $18,632M
        *   *Formula: WACC = (Market Cap / EV) \* Cost of Equity + (Total Debt / EV) \* After-Tax Cost of Debt*
        *   Calculation: ($11,366 / $18,632) \* 5.76% + ($7,417 / $18,632) \* 4.97% = **5.49%**

*   **Market-Implied Growth and Margin Assumptions:**
    *   Holding the TTM operating margin of **2.36%** (EBIT/Revenue) constant and using a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, a 5-year Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model requires a **revenue CAGR of 2.15%** to arrive at the current market price of $19.52.
    *   **Conclusion:** To justify today's stock price, an investor must believe Albertsons can grow its revenue by approximately **2.15% annually** for the next five years while maintaining its current operating margin of **2.36%**.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Corrected Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on more realistic assumptions for a mature company in the grocery sector.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** The original analysis contained assumptions, particularly for the discount rate and terminal value, that are not aligned with industry realities. This revised case adjusts these factors to create a more plausible valuation.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:**
    *   The 1.5% annual revenue growth rate from the original analysis remains a reasonable, conservative assumption, reflecting historical performance and a competitive market. I will retain the **1.5% annual revenue growth rate**.

8.  **Margin Path:**
    *   The stable **operating margin of 2.40%** is a sound assumption, slightly above the TTM figure but below prior years, reflecting competitive pressures. This assumption is retained.

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   The normalized **tax rate of 22.0%** is a prudent long-term assumption, correcting for recent one-time benefits. This assumption is retained.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   Modeling **Capex at 2.2% of revenue** and **Change in Working Capital at -0.5% of the change in revenue** are reasonable assumptions based on guidance and historical trends. They are retained.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Holding SBC constant at **$105M annually** is a reasonable forecast.
    *   **Share Count Correction:** The original analysis incorrectly used a future (Year 5) share count to calculate the present value per share. The intrinsic value calculated today is for the entire equity pie, which should be divided by the **current number of shares outstanding (582.3M)**. The effect of buybacks is implicitly captured as a return of capital to shareholders and does not require a change to the valuation denominator.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):** The FCFF calculation remains methodologically sound.
    *   *Formula: FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital*

| (Figures in Millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $82,221 | $83,454 | $84,706 | $85,977 | $87,266 |
| EBIT (2.40% Margin) | $1,973 | $2,003 | $2,033 | $2,063 | $2,094 |
| EBIT \* (1-Tax Rate) | $1,539 | $1,562 | $1,586 | $1,610 | $1,634 |
| \+ D&A (3.0% of Revenue) | $2,467 | $2,504 | $2,541 | $2,579 | $2,618 |
| \- SBC | ($105) | ($105) | ($105) | ($105) | ($105) |
| \- Capex (2.2% of Revenue) | ($1,809) | ($1,836) | ($1,863) | ($1,891) | ($1,920) |
| \- Change in WC | ($6) | ($6) | ($6) | ($6) | ($6) |
| **FCFF** | **$2,086** | **$2,118** | **$2,152** | **$2,186** | **$2,220** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC) - REVISED**

14-16. **Correction:** The original Beta of 0.30 is extremely low, even for a defensive stock, leading to an overly low WACC. A more realistic Beta for a large, established grocery company would be closer to 0.50. This adjustment provides a more appropriate discount rate reflecting market risk.

*   **Revised Cost of Equity:** 4.26% + **0.50** \* 5.0% = **6.76%**
*   **Revised WACC:** ($11,366 / $18,632) \* **6.76%** + ($7,417 / $18,632) \* 4.97% = 4.12% + 1.98% = **6.10%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE - REVISED**

17. **Correction:** The original Gordon Growth calculation resulted in an implied EV/EBITDA multiple of 16.2x, which is unrealistic for the grocery sector. Mature, low-growth grocers typically trade in the 6.0x to 8.0x range. Therefore, the **Exit Multiple Method** is more appropriate and provides a reality-based anchor for the terminal value.

18. **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   A terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of **7.0x** is used. This is a realistic multiple for a stable, large-scale grocery operator.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $2,094M + $2,618M = **$4,712M**
    *   *Formula: Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA \* Exit Multiple*
    *   Calculation: $4,712M \* 7.0 = **$32,984M**
    *   **Implied Growth Rate Cross-Check:** This terminal value implies a perpetual growth rate of approximately 1.2%, which is a more sustainable and conservative long-term assumption than the 2.5% used previously. *(Calculation: g = (WACC * TV - FCFF_Y5) / (TV + FCFF_Y5) = (6.10% * 32,984 - 2,220) / (32,984 + 2,220) ≈ 1.2%)*

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   *Formula: EV = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value*
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF (discounted at 6.10%): $1,966M + $1,881M + $1,798M + $1,718M + $1,642M = **$9,005M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value (discounted at 6.10%): $32,984M / (1.061)^5 = **$24,534M**
    *   Total Enterprise Value = $9,005M + $24,534M = **$33,539M**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   *Formula: Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $7,417M - $151M = $7,266M
    *   Equity Value = $33,539M - $7,266M = **$26,273M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Current Diluted Shares Outstanding: **582.3M**
    *   *Formula: Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Current Diluted Shares*
    *   Base-Case Fair Value = $26,273M / 582.3M shares = **$45.12**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $45.12**. Based on 1.5% revenue growth, 2.40% operating margins, and a 7.0x exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $35.60**. Assumes 0.5% revenue growth, margin compression to 2.20%, and a lower 6.0x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $55.85**. Assumes 2.5% revenue growth, margin expansion to 2.60%, and a higher 8.0x exit multiple.

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate.
    *   *Formula: MOS Price = Base-Case Fair Value \* (1 - 0.30)*
    *   Calculation: $45.12 \* 0.70 = **$31.58**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competitive Intensity:** The U.S. grocery market is highly competitive with low-profit margins. Increased price investment from competitors like Walmart, Kroger, and Costco could pressure ACI's margins and market share.
2.  **Inflation and Consumer Spending:** While moderate inflation can boost revenue figures, high inflation can compress margins and alter consumer behavior towards lower-margin private label products or discount stores.
3.  **Labor Costs:** As a heavily unionized company, ACI is exposed to rising wage rates and healthcare/pension costs. Unfavorable outcomes in collective bargaining negotiations could significantly impact operating expenses. (ACI 10-K for FY2024, p. 18).
4.  **Operational Execution:** The success of the valuation is contingent on management's ability to execute productivity initiatives, manage its supply chain effectively, and innovate its digital and loyalty platforms to retain customers.
5.  **Regulatory Risk:** The food and drug retail industry is subject to numerous regulations. Changes in food safety, pharmacy reimbursement rates, or environmental laws could increase compliance costs.

final answer is 45.12 $
