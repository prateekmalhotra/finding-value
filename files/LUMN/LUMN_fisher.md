### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen is focusing on "Grow" products, including IP services, dark fiber, and conduit, which saw a 7% revenue increase in the first half of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The company is strategically investing in its fiber network, including the Quantum Fiber buildout, to meet the increasing demand for high-speed data transmission driven by multi-cloud storage, digital applications, and artificial intelligence. However, the company's overall revenue has been declining, with a 4% decrease in the first half of 2025 compared to the prior year, and the company faces intense competition. The recent agreement to sell a significant portion of its Mass Markets fiber-to-the-home business further complicates the long-term sales growth picture.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen's strategy is to "digitally connect people, data, and applications quickly, securely, and effortlessly," with a focus on delivering infrastructure for network, transport, data, and computing needs. The company is expanding its product offerings and strengthening digital self-service platforms. A key element of its network expansion is the Quantum Fiber buildout project. These initiatives demonstrate a commitment to developing new products and services to address evolving market demands.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen held approximately 2,400 patents and patent applications as of December 31, 2024, and plans to continue filing new applications. The company's "Black Lotus Labs" serves as its cyberthreat research and intelligence arm. However, the 10-K and 10-Q filings do not provide specific financial data on research and development spending, making it difficult to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of these efforts relative to the company's size and in comparison to competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen utilizes a multi-channel sales approach, including direct sales representatives, inbound call centers, telemarketing, and third-party partners. The company emphasizes a customer-oriented approach with a local presence. However, the consistent decline in overall revenue, including an 11% drop in Business Segment Revenue and a 32% drop in Mass Markets Segment Revenue from 2022 to 2023, suggests the sales organization is not consistently outperforming the market or its competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Lumen reported a net loss of $1.116 billion. The company also reported an operating loss of $496 million for the same period. The company has a history of significant goodwill impairment charges, including a $628 million charge in the second quarter of 2025 and $10.7 billion in 2023. These factors indicate that the company does not currently have worthwhile profit margins.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm) (June 30, 2025)
 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen is implementing "modernization and simplification initiatives" aimed at lowering costs. The company has also undertaken workforce reductions to decrease employee-related expenses. Furthermore, the company is managing its "Harvest" and "Nurture" product categories for cash flow, which implies a focus on maximizing profitability from these mature service lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, approximately 20% of Lumen's employees were represented by unions, with 88% of these represented employees subject to collective bargaining agreements expiring within the next year. The company states it strives to work collaboratively with unions. However, the company also notes the risk of strikes, work slowdowns, or other labor actions which could disrupt services and increase costs. The lack of more detailed information on employee turnover and engagement makes it difficult to assess the overall state of labor relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm) (June 30, 2025)
 [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced changes in its senior leadership team, which it states have played a "critical role in modernizing our business, attracting new talent and invigorating our culture." The provided documents do not highlight any significant issues or disputes among the executive team. However, without more specific information on executive stability and succession planning, it is difficult to definitively categorize executive relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen's reporting structure is organized by customer-facing sales channels within two main segments: Business and Mass Markets. This structure suggests a layer of management with specific responsibilities for each segment and sales channel. The company has also made changes to its senior leadership team to position for growth and success. While the provided filings do not detail succession planning, the organizational structure implies a degree of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited by KPMG LLP, which has provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company's filings provide detailed segment reporting and breakdowns of operating expenses. There are no indications of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the provided documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen operates one of the world's most interconnected communications networks, with approximately 163,000 fiber on-net buildings and 340,000 route miles of fiber optic cable globally. This extensive network is a significant asset in an industry where reach and reliability are critical. The company's focus on monetizing these assets through its Private Connectivity Fabric solutions is a key strategic initiative. However, the company also faces significant competition from a variety of providers, some of whom have newer or more advanced systems.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000010/lumn-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen's significant capital expenditures, projected to be between $4.1 billion and $4.3 billion in 2025, are focused on enhancing network operating efficiencies, developing new services, and expanding its fiber network. This level of investment, despite current net losses, suggests a focus on long-term growth and competitiveness rather than short-term profitability. The company's strategy to expand its network capacity through its AI backbone initiative and execute its Quantum Fiber buildout plan further supports a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm) (June 30, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Lumen had $1.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $723 million of available borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facilities. The company has a significant amount of long-term debt, totaling $17.6 billion. In 2024 and 2025, the company engaged in a series of debt transactions to extend maturities and enhance liquidity. While the company has access to capital, its high leverage and recent net losses suggest that significant future financing needs could potentially involve equity, which would be dilutive to shareholders.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/18926/000001892625000093/lumn-20250630.htm) (June 30, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lumen provides detailed financial reporting through its 10-K and 10-Q filings, which include extensive "Management's Discussion and Analysis" sections that address both positive and negative trends impacting the business. The company also hosts earnings calls and webcasts meetings with investors. The risk factors section of the 10-K is comprehensive and outlines numerous challenges and potential headwinds facing the company.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a written Code of Conduct applicable to all directors, officers, and employees. The provided filings disclose several legal proceedings, including a shareholder lawsuit and investigations related to the use of Huawei equipment. While legal and regulatory challenges are not uncommon for a company of Lumen's size and scope, the number and nature of these proceedings raise questions about the company's past practices.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis**

Lumen Technologies is a company in transition, attempting to pivot from declining legacy services to a new portfolio of "Grow" products centered around its extensive fiber network. The company's strengths lie in its commitment to ongoing development, its detailed financial reporting, and a long-range outlook that prioritizes capital investment in its network. However, Lumen faces significant headwinds, including declining overall revenues, a lack of profitability, and a highly competitive market. The planned sale of a large portion of its consumer fiber business introduces further uncertainty. Key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months include the successful execution of its "Grow" product strategy to achieve top-line growth, a significant improvement in profitability and margins, and a reduction in its substantial debt load. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" for "Products/Services with Long Runway" if the company can demonstrate sustained revenue growth in its "Grow" segment that outpaces the decline in its legacy businesses. Similarly, a positive resolution of outstanding legal and regulatory matters would be necessary to change the answer on "Unquestionable Integrity."
