Synthesis:
Autodesk exhibits strength in its market position, product runway, and financial health, with a solid subscription model and strong profit margins. However, recent events have cast a shadow over the company's governance and internal controls. The ongoing accounting investigation, coupled with concerns about management's transparency and integrity, presents a significant risk to the company's investment thesis. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the resolution of the accounting investigation and any subsequent actions taken by regulatory bodies. A clean bill of health and a demonstrated commitment to improved governance could turn several "No" answers to "Yes," while further negative revelations would solidify them.

fisher score is 9 / 15
