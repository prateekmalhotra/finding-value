Dine Brands Global, Inc. (DIN), August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed include the 2024 10-K filing (published February 21, 2025), recent earnings call transcripts, and supplementary market data.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's core brands, Applebee's and IHOP, operate in mature and highly competitive segments of the restaurant industry. Recent performance indicates headwinds, with Applebee's domestic same-restaurant sales declining by 4.2% and IHOP's by 2.0% in fiscal 2024. Furthermore, Applebee's experienced a net reduction of 28 domestic franchise restaurants in 2024, signaling contraction rather than growth in its primary market. While the company is pursuing international expansion and dual-branded concepts, these initiatives are not yet large enough to offset the negative trends in the core domestic business.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a commitment to developing new products and processes. This includes menu innovation, the expansion of its off-premise business (IHOP 'N Go), and the launch of the International Bank of Pancakes loyalty program to drive visit frequency. The company is also exploring new growth platforms such as dual-branded restaurant formats and has shown a willingness to acquire new concepts, as with the 2022 purchase of Fuzzy's Taco Shop. These actions indicate a clear determination to evolve beyond the brands' traditional offerings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dine Brands does not disclose a specific budget for Research & Development, which is common in the restaurant industry where such costs are embedded in marketing and G&A. While the company is consistently launching new menu items and technology platforms (e.g., loyalty programs), the effectiveness of these efforts is questionable given the negative domestic same-restaurant sales growth at both Applebee's (-4.2%) and IHOP (-2.0%) in 2024. There is no clear evidence that the company's development output is more effective than its peers, especially as it is underperforming the casual and family dining segments.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a franchisor, the "sales organization" is the franchise development team, and its primary metric of success is net unit growth. In fiscal 2024, the Applebee's system experienced a net reduction of 28 franchise restaurants, and the Fuzzy's system saw a net reduction of 15 units. While IHOP showed a modest net addition of 10 restaurants, the overall picture at the consolidated level is one of contraction, not of an above-average sales effort.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Due to its highly-franchised business model (over 97% of restaurants are franchisee-owned), Dine Brands maintains structurally high profit margins. Revenue is primarily comprised of high-margin royalties and franchise fees rather than lower-margin food and labor costs. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company generated a gross profit of $375.3 million on $812.3 million of revenue, for a gross margin of approximately 46.2%. This is a worthwhile margin inherent to the franchisor business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company actively works to maintain its margins through cost discipline and structural advantages. G&A expenses decreased by $1.4 million in 2024, partly due to cost management, including stopping the IHOP Flip'd initiative. The company also utilizes Centralized Supply Chain Services, LLC ("CSCS"), an independent co-op, to manage procurement for both brands, leveraging scale to achieve lower, more sustainable prices for franchisees, which helps protect the overall health of the system that generates Dine's royalty revenue.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states that "we believe our relations with employees are good" and notes that its employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements. The "Human Capital" section details initiatives such as Team Member Resource Groups and engagement surveys to foster an inclusive culture. However, this is standard corporate disclosure, and there is no specific, verifiable evidence (like independently verified low attrition rates vs. peers or employee satisfaction awards) to suggest that relations are "outstanding" as per Fisher's high standard.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability in key leadership roles, including the CEO, who has been in the position since 2017. There have been no recent reports of significant or unusual executive turnover or public disputes among the leadership team. The company's filings indicate a standard corporate governance structure with a clear delineation of roles and responsibilities. This stability suggests effective and professional relations at the executive level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership structure includes presidents for each of its three brands (Applebee's, IHOP, and Fuzzy's) in addition to corporate executives for functions like legal, finance, and strategy. This structure ensures dedicated leadership and accountability at the brand level while leveraging shared services at the corporate level. This demonstrates a clear depth of management beyond the CEO, with experienced leaders responsible for the day-to-day operations and strategic direction of each distinct business unit.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dine Brands' 2024 10-K includes an audit report from Ernst & Young LLP, a major independent registered public accounting firm, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The report also confirmed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024. There is no history of significant restatements or disclosures of material weaknesses, indicating that the company's accounting and control systems are robust and reliable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key clue in the franchise restaurant industry is the health and growth of the franchisee base. For Dine Brands, a significant clue is the high concentration of ownership within the Applebee's system, where the ten largest franchisees operate 81% of all domestic restaurants. This indicates the brand relies on a small number of large, sophisticated operators. However, the recent negative same-restaurant sales and net unit closures for Applebee's suggest that even these major franchisees are struggling to grow, a negative clue about the brand's competitive standing. The fact the company had to acquire 56 restaurants from franchisees in November 2024 further suggests franchisee distress.
**Answer:** No

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary and actions suggest a focus on long-term health, even if near-term results are weak. The company is investing in technology, loyalty programs, and off-premise capabilities, which require upfront capital and may not yield immediate profits. Furthermore, the strategy to explore dual-branded restaurants and acquire new concepts like Fuzzy's indicates a long-range view aimed at portfolio diversification and future growth, rather than maximizing profits from the core brands in the short term.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial policy is to return capital to shareholders, not dilute them. In 2024, Dine Brands returned approximately $43.4 million to stockholders through $31.3 million in dividends and $12.1 million in share repurchases. The company funds its operations with cash from operations and its existing debt facilities. The existence of a $250 million share repurchase program, authorized in February 2022, is strong evidence that the company is not anticipating the need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent earnings call transcripts indicates a high level of candor. Management openly discusses the challenges facing the business, such as the declines in traffic and same-restaurant sales at both major brands. They directly address the underperformance and articulate the specific strategies being deployed to combat these trends, such as marketing initiatives and value offerings. This transparency in the face of negative results demonstrates a willingness to communicate openly with investors during difficult periods.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags that would question the integrity of the management team. The company's financial statements are audited by a reputable firm, there are no disclosed material legal or regulatory proceedings related to executive misconduct, and the 2024 10-K reports no related-party transactions that suggest conflicts of interest. The company's governance structures appear to be standard for a publicly-traded firm.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm) (February 21, 2025)

**Synthesis**

Dine Brands Global exhibits the financial characteristics of a mature, highly-franchised company but struggles with the operational challenges of its core brands. The strongest positives are structural: the franchise model generates worthwhile profit margins (Point 5) and strong, stable cash flows that allow the company to return capital to shareholders via dividends and buybacks without resorting to dilutive financing (Point 13). The management team appears stable, deep, and candid (Points 8, 9, 14, 15). However, the company's primary weakness is its lack of a clear growth runway (Point 1), evidenced by persistent negative same-restaurant sales and net unit closures in its largest brand, Applebee's (Point 4).

The Fisher score will most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on the effectiveness of its brand revitalization efforts. The key variable is whether the menu, marketing, and technology initiatives (Point 2) can reverse the negative sales trends. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on Point 1 (Long Runway) would require specific evidence of a sustained period of positive domestic same-restaurant sales growth and a halt to the net closure of Applebee's units.

**fisher score is 10 / 15**
