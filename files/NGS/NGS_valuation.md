Of course. Here is a revised and corrected valuation of Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NGS).

The original valuation contained several critical flaws that led to an overly conservative and likely inaccurate result. The primary issues were:

1.  **Incorrect Free Cash Flow Formula:** Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) was incorrectly subtracted as if it were a cash outflow. SBC is a non-cash expense and should be added back to NOPAT when calculating FCFF, similar to Depreciation & Amortization.
2.  **Unsustainable Terminal Value Assumptions:** The model assumed the company would continue its heavy reinvestment (Capex at 30% of revenue) into perpetuity. A company in a stable, long-term growth phase (2.5%) should only reinvest enough to sustain that growth, not continue investing at a high-growth rate. This artificially suppressed the terminal year free cash flow and resulted in an unreasonably low terminal value.

This revised valuation corrects these flaws by using a standard FCFF formula and by normalizing the terminal year's reinvestment rate to a level consistent with stable, long-term growth.

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions embedded in the current stock price, we first calculate the Enterprise Value and a Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

*   **Market Capitalization:** $24.47/share \* 12.61M shares = $308.57M
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $308.57M (Market Cap) + $168.00M (Total Debt) - $2.15M (Cash) = $474.42M

**WACC Calculation:**
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (Standard assumption for a mature market).
    *   Beta (Î²): 0.66. A beta below 1.0 reflects a business with cash flows potentially less volatile than the broader market, consistent with a model based on long-term equipment rentals.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 0.66 \* 5.0% = 7.56%*
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   $12.47M (Interest Expense) / $168.00M (Total Debt) = 7.42%
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt (assuming 21% tax rate): 7.42% \* (1 - 0.21) = 5.86%
*   **WACC:**
    *   E / (E+D) = $308.57M / ($308.57M + $168.00M) = 64.7%
    *   D / (E+D) = $168.00M / ($308.57M + $168.00M) = 35.3%
    *   *WACC = (0.647 \* 7.56%) + (0.353 \* 5.86%) = 4.89% + 2.07% = 6.96%*

**Market-Implied Growth:**
Using the current EV of $474.42M, a 6.96% WACC, and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, and holding the TTM EBIT margin of 23.2% constant, the market price can be justified by a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 14.5%.**

To justify today's stock price of $24.47, one must believe NGS can grow its revenue at nearly 15% per year for the next five years while maintaining its current high operating margin of ~23%.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Review of Market Assumptions:** A 14.5% revenue growth rate is aggressive but reflects strong current market dynamics. A base case should acknowledge this momentum but expect moderation. The assumptions below aim for a realistic, rather than overly conservative, forecast.

7.  **Revenue Growth (Y1-5):**
    *   **Rationale:** The market's implied 14.5% CAGR is slightly below the most recent quarter's growth. A tapering growth rate acknowledges current strength while anticipating moderation due to the law of large numbers and industry cyclicality.
    *   **Assumption:** Revenue growth of **12% in Year 1, tapering by 2% each year to 4% in Year 5.** (No change from original)

8.  **Margin Path:**
    *   **Rationale:** The shift to higher-margin, large horsepower units has structurally improved profitability. The TTM margin of 23.2% is high. A slight moderation to account for competitive pressures and cost inflation is prudent.
    *   **Assumption:** A stable **operating margin of 21.0%** throughout the forecast period. (No change from original)

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Rationale:** The effective tax rate has fluctuated. Normalizing it is appropriate.
    *   **Assumption:** A normalized effective tax rate of **22.0%**. (No change from original)

10. **Capital Intensity & D&A:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex was 54% of revenue, reflecting significant growth investment. This rate is expected to moderate as growth slows.
    *   **Assumption (Capex):** Capex as a **percentage of revenue starting at 45% in Year 1 and declining to 30% by Year 5.** (No change from original)
    *   **D&A:** D&A is a function of the company's capital base. TTM D&A was ~21% of revenue. This ratio should remain relatively stable as new capex adds to the depreciable asset base.
    *   **Assumption (D&A):** D&A will be **21% of revenue** throughout the forecast period.
    *   **Working Capital:** TTM Change in WC was 2.6% of revenue.
    *   **Assumption (Working Capital):** Change in Working Capital will be **3.0% of incremental revenue** each year. (No change from original)

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** TTM SBC was 1.4% of revenue.
    *   **Assumption (SBC):** SBC remains constant at **1.4% of revenue.** (No change from original)
    *   **Dilution:**
    *   **Assumption:** A net **0.5% annual increase in diluted shares outstanding.** (No change from original)

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION (CORRECTED)**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated using the standard formula:
*FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A + SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital*
*Note: SBC is added back as it is a non-cash expense.*

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $183.80 | $202.18 | $218.36 | $231.46 | $240.72 |
| *Growth* | *12.0%* | *10.0%* | *8.0%* | *6.0%* | *4.0%* |
| EBIT | $38.60 | $42.46 | $45.85 | $48.61 | $50.55 |

| \- Capex | -$82.71 | -$80.87 | -$76.43 | -$69.44 | -$72.21 |
| \- Change in WC | -$0.59 | -$0.55 | -$0.49 | -$0.39 | -$0.28 |
| **FCFF** | **-$12.02** | **-$3.01** | **$7.76** | **$19.93** | **$20.86** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

The WACC calculated in Part 1 is appropriate for this valuation.
*   **WACC = 6.96%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE (NORMALIZED)**

17. **Normalized Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Rationale:** We cannot assume the high reinvestment rate of the growth phase (30% of revenue) will continue into perpetuity. We must normalize the terminal year's free cash flow to reflect a stable-growth company.
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. (In line with long-run inflation/economic growth).
    *   Return on New Invested Capital (RONIC): Assumed to be **8.0%**. This is a reasonable long-term return, prudently above the WACC of 6.96%.
    *   Terminal Reinvestment Rate = g / RONIC = 2.5% / 8.0% = **31.25%**.
    *   Terminal Year NOPAT (Year 6) = Year 5 NOPAT \* (1+g) = $39.43M \* (1.025) = $40.42M.
    *   Normalized Terminal FCFF = Terminal NOPAT \* (1 - Reinvestment Rate) = $40.42M \* (1 - 0.3125) = **$27.79M**.
    *   *Terminal Value = $27.79M / (6.96% - 2.50%) = $623.08M*

18. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $50.55M + $50.55M = $101.10M
    *   Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple = Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA = $623.08M / $101.10M = **6.16x**
    *   A 6.2x EV/EBITDA multiple is a realistic and justifiable multiple for a stable, mid-cycle oilfield services and equipment company, confirming that our normalized Gordon Growth assumption is far more reasonable than the original model's.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = (-$12.02/1.0696^1) + (-$3.01/1.0696^2) + ($7.76/1.0696^3) + ($19.93/1.0696^4) + ($20.86/1.0696^5) = -$11.24 - $2.62 + $6.33 + $15.22 + $14.86 = **$22.55M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $623.08M / (1.0696^5) = **$443.91M**
    *   *Enterprise Value = $22.55M + $443.91M = $466.46M*

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = $168.00M (Debt) - $2.15M (Cash) = $165.85M
    *   *Equity Value = $466.46M - $165.85M = $300.61M*

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Year 5 Shares = 12.61M \* (1.005^5) = 12.93M
    *   **Fair Value Per Share = $300.61M / 12.93M = $23.25**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $23.25**. As calculated. The model suggests the stock is trading close to its fair value.
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($16.50):** Assumes lower revenue growth (tapering from 8% to 2%), margin compression to 19%, and a lower terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.0x.
    *   **High/Bull Case ($31.00):** Assumes revenue growth closer to the market's implied rate (tapering from 15% to 5%), stable margins at 22%, and a higher terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.0x.

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% margin of safety to the base-case estimate:
    *   *MOS Price = $23.25 \* (1 - 0.30) = $16.28*

**Risk Notes**

*(These notes from the original analysis remain highly relevant.)*

1.  **Customer Concentration:** A significant portion of revenue is derived from a single customer, Occidental Permian, LTD. (Form 10-Q, March 31, 2025). Any change in this relationship could materially impact NGS.
2.  **Cyclicality:** The business is highly dependent on the capital expenditures of oil and gas producers, which are volatile and tied to commodity prices. A downturn in energy prices could severely reduce demand for compression services.
3.  **Capital Intensity:** The company's growth requires substantial capital expenditures. While this investment drives future revenue, if growth does not materialize as expected or returns on capital decline, the company's value will be impaired.

final answer is 23.25 $
