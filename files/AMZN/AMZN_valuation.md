| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | 9.0% | Midpoint of management's Q2 guidance (7-11%). (Form 10-Q, May 1, 2025, p. 30). Assumed for the full first year. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD, Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.30%** (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium (ERP): **5.5%** (Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.).
    *   Levered Beta: **1.31** (Source: StockAnalysis.com, 5-Year Monthly Beta). This reflects higher volatility than the market average, consistent with the high-growth, technology-focused nature of Amazon's businesses.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 1.31 * 5.5% = 11.51%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt
    *   Calculation: $2,230M / $159,570M = **1.40%**
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 1.40% * (1 - 15.0%) = **1.19%**

*   **WACC:**
    *   **Formula:** WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): $2.39 Trillion (StockAnalysis.com, August 21, 2025).
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $159.57 Billion (Book value used as a proxy).
    *   **WACC = (2390 / 2549.57) * 11.51% + (159.57 / 2549.57) * 1.19% = 10.78% + 0.07% = 10.85%**

---

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This rate is chosen as a conservative long-term growth assumption, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = $22,783 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.1085 - 0.025) = $277,931 Million**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** This cross-check was not performed due to the lack of readily available, consistently calculated historical median multiples from the specified primary sources. The Gordon Growth method will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| (USD, Millions) | FCFF | PV Factor | PV of FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Year 1 | $17,176 | 0.902 | $15,492 |
| Year 2 | $17,175 | 0.814 | $13,980 |
| Year 3 | $24,489 | 0.734 | $17,975 |
| Year 4 | $20,695 | 0.662 | $13,700 |
| Year 5 | $22,783 | 0.597 | $13,602 |
| **Sum of PV of FCFF** | | | **$74,749** |
| **PV of Terminal Value** ($277,931 * 0.597) | | | **$165,925** |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | | | **$240,674** |

*   **Equity Value Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash & Equivalents
    *   Enterprise Value: $240,674 Million
    *   Less: Total Debt: ($159,570 Million) (StockAnalysis.com, July 31, 2025)
    *   Plus: Cash & Equivalents: $93,180 Million (StockAnalysis.com, July 31, 2025)
    *   **Equity Value = $174,284 Million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares
    *   **$174,284 Million / 10,777 Million shares = $16.17 Per Share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $12.50.** Assumes lower revenue growth (7.0% tapering to 5.0%) and margin compression to 10.5% due to increased competition and fulfillment costs.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $21.00.** Assumes higher revenue growth (11.0% tapering to 9.0%) and margin expansion to 14.0% driven by faster-than-expected AWS growth and significant advertising segment gains.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **Formula:** MOS Price = Base-Case Value * (1 - 30%)
    *   **$16.17 * 0.70 = $11.32 Per Share**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Competition:** Intense competition in all segments (retail, cloud, advertising) could pressure growth rates and margins more than anticipated.
2.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Ongoing antitrust and data privacy investigations in the U.S. and Europe could result in significant fines or mandated changes to business practices, impacting profitability.
3.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** A global economic slowdown could curb consumer discretionary spending and reduce enterprise IT budgets, negatively impacting both the retail and AWS segments.
4.  **Capital Intensity:** Management has guided for increased capital expenditures. If these investments do not generate the expected returns, or if costs escalate, future free cash flow could be significantly lower than projected.
5.  **AWS Growth Deceleration:** The valuation is sensitive to the high-margin AWS segment. A faster-than-expected deceleration in cloud computing growth would materially lower the intrinsic value estimate.

final answer is 16.17 $
