1.  **Current Market Price:** $86.15 (August 22, 2025)
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM):**

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions priced into the stock, a reverse DCF was constructed. The model holds the TTM operating margin and other key ratios constant, and solves for the 5-year revenue CAGR required to justify the current market price of $86.15.

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue CAGR: approximately 3.5%**
*   **Market-Implied Operating Margin: 8.7% (held constant at TTM level)**

This analysis suggests that to justify the current stock price, investors must believe UPS can grow its revenues at a CAGR of roughly 3.5% over the next five years, while maintaining its current operating margin of 8.7%.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Revenue Growth:** The market-implied growth of 3.5% is higher than the TTM revenue growth of 0.91%. Given recent performance and a cautious economic outlook, a more conservative revenue growth assumption is warranted. A 2.0% annual growth rate for the next 5 years is assumed, which is below the market's expectation.
7.  **Margin Path:** The TTM operating margin is 8.7%. This is assumed to remain constant over the 5-year forecast period.
8.  **Taxes:** The effective tax rate over the last three years has averaged approximately 21.5%. A conservative 22% effective tax rate is assumed.
9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** The 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 4.8%. This is used for the forecast.
    *   **Working Capital:** Change in working capital is modeled at 1.5% of the change in revenue, based on historical averages.
10. **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-based compensation is included as a cash outflow.
    *   The latest diluted share count of 852 million is used.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $92,119 | $93,962 | $95,841 | $97,758 | $99,713 |
| EBIT | $8,016 | $8,177 | $8,340 | $8,507 | $8,677 |
| NOPAT | $6,253 | $6,378 | $6,505 | $6,635 | $6,768 |
| D&A | $3,760 | $3,836 | $3,913 | $3,992 | $4,071 |
| Capex | ($4,422) | ($4,510) | ($4,600) | ($4,692) | ($4,786) |
| Change in WC | ($27) | ($28) | ($28) | ($29) | ($29) |
| SBC | ($37) | ($37) | ($37) | ($37) | ($37) |
| **FCFF** | **$5,527** | **$5,639** | **$5,753** | **$5,869** | **$5,987** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

11. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.3% (10-Year Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (Standard Market Premium)
    *   Beta: 1.10 (5-Year Monthly Beta)
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.3% + 1.10 * 5.0% = 9.8%*
12. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = $911 / $28,909 = 3.15%
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 3.15% * (1 - 22%) = 2.46%
13. **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity = $86.15 * 852 million = $73,392 million
    *   Market Value of Debt = $28,909 million
    *   *WACC = (73,392 / (73,392 + 28,909)) * 9.8% + (28,909 / (73,392 + 28,909)) * 2.46% = 7.6%*

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

14. **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.0% (Long-run inflation expectation)
    *   *Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($5,987 * 1.02) / (7.6% - 2.0%) = $108,983 million*
15. **Cross-Check (Exit Multiple):** Not performed due to the preference for the more conservative Gordon Growth method.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

16. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $5,137 + $5,077 + $5,018 + $4,959 + $4,902 = $25,093 million
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $108,983 / (1 + 7.6%)^5 = $75,584 million
    *   *Enterprise Value = $25,093 + $75,584 = $100,677 million*
17. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = $28,909 (Total Debt) - $6,194 (Cash) = $22,715 million
    *   *Equity Value = $100,677 - $22,715 = $77,962 million*

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

18. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *$77,962 million / 852 million shares = $91.50 per share*
19. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $91.50
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** With 0% revenue growth and margin compression to 8.0%, the value would be approximately **$75 per share.**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** With 3.5% revenue growth (matching the market) and slight margin expansion to 9.0%, the value would be approximately **$110 per share.**
20. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety from the base-case estimate results in a MOS price of **$64.05**.

### **Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include: 1) a prolonged global economic downturn reducing shipping volumes; 2) failure to manage operating costs, particularly labor and fuel, which could compress margins; 3) increased competition from both legacy and new players in the logistics space; 4) a significant decline in e-commerce growth, which has been a major tailwind for the industry; and 5) potential for labor disputes to disrupt operations.

final answer is 91.50 $
