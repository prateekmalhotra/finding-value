In addition to new development, MAA has an ongoing program to redevelop and reposition existing properties, including renovating kitchens and bathrooms and installing smart home technology to drive rent growth.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a REIT, MAA does not have traditional R&D expenses. However, its investments in technology and property redevelopment can be considered analogous to R&D. The company has invested in a proprietary technology platform that supports online leasing, resident portals, and self-guided tours, which has improved operating efficiencies and resident satisfaction. The company has also installed smart home technology in over 96,000 units, which has resulted in an average effective rent increase of approximately $25 per month per unit.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the context of a REIT, the "sales organization" is the leasing and property management function. MAA has a sophisticated, technology-driven platform for leasing and resident services, including the use of search engine optimization, internet leasing solutions, and a web-based resident portal for online applications, leases, and renewals. The company's average physical occupancy was 94.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, indicating a strong ability to attract and retain tenants.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["10-K," sec.gov, February 4, 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a REIT, net operating income (NOI) margin is a key profitability metric. For the year ended December 31, 2024, MAA's same-store NOI margin was not explicitly stated in the provided documents, but can be derived from revenue and expense figures. A review of recent performance shows strong profitability. In its Q1 2025 earnings release, MAA reported a 2.3% increase in same-store NOI over the prior year period, driven by a 2.7% increase in revenues. The company's historical financial performance, as detailed in its 10-K, shows a consistent ability to generate positive and growing net income.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA is actively focused on improving margins through several initiatives. These include a disciplined approach to expense control, leveraging its scale to achieve purchasing efficiencies, and investing in technology to automate processes and reduce overhead. The company's property redevelopment and smart home installation programs are designed to generate higher rental rates and ancillary income, which directly contributes to margin expansion. Furthermore, MAA's portfolio is concentrated in markets with strong demand, which provides a favorable backdrop for rental rate growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's 2024 10-K details the company's focus on human capital management, including efforts to foster an inclusive and diverse workforce, provide competitive pay and benefits, and offer opportunities for growth and development. As of December 31, 2024, ethnic/cultural minorities represented approximately 54% of the workforce and 43% of leadership positions, while females represented approximately 46% of the workforce and 57% of leadership positions.

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA has demonstrated a stable and experienced leadership team. The company has a formal succession plan, which has resulted in the recent internal promotion of a new CEO, effective April 1, 2025.

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's succession planning and the recent promotions of several key executives to top leadership positions, including a new CEO, President, and CFO, indicate a strong bench of internal talent. The company's investor relations materials and SEC filings list a number of experienced senior vice presidents and other key executives beyond the named executive officers, suggesting a deep and capable management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["10-K," sec.gov, February 4, 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, which provides an unqualified opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The company provides detailed segment reporting for its "Same Store" and "Non-Same Store and Other" portfolios, which allows for clear analysis of its operating performance. There is no history of significant restatements or material weaknesses in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's key competitive advantages in the apartment REIT industry include its portfolio's concentration in the high-growth Sunbelt region, its large and diversified portfolio across various submarkets and price points, and its scalable, technology-driven operating platform. The company's ability to internally manage development, redevelopment, and acquisitions provides a significant advantage in creating value and controlling costs compared to competitors who may rely more heavily on third-party service providers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["10-K," sec.gov, February 4, 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's strategy of investing in new development and redevelopment projects, which can take several years to complete and stabilize, demonstrates a focus on long-term value creation. The company's willingness to dispose of non-core assets and reinvest the proceeds into higher-growth opportunities also reflects a long-range perspective. In its Q1 2025 earnings call, management discussed the near-term challenges of new supply in some markets but emphasized the positive long-term demand fundamentals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["10-K," sec.gov, February 4, 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm), ["Mid-America Apartment Communities, Inc. (MAA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript," discountingcashflows.com, May 1, 2025](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/MAA/transcripts/2025/1/)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA maintains a strong, investment-grade balance sheet with a target net debt-to-Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 4.5x to 5.5x; as of December 31, 2024, this ratio was 4.0x, indicating significant borrowing capacity. The company has a $1.25 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program to provide liquidity for its operations and investment activities. While the company may issue equity from time to time through its at-the-market (ATM) program, its primary sources of capital for growth are retained cash flow, proceeds from dispositions, and debt. The company did not sell any shares under its ATM program in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["10-K," sec.gov, February 4, 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the Q1 2025 earnings call transcript shows that management openly discussed both positive and negative trends affecting the business. For example, they addressed the challenges of new apartment supply in certain markets and its impact on rent growth, while also highlighting the strong demand and positive long-term outlook. Management provides detailed quarterly supplemental financial data and regularly participates in industry conferences and investor meetings.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags in the company's 2024 10-K. The company is a defendant in a class-action lawsuit related to rent-setting software, but this is an industry-wide issue affecting many large apartment owners. The company has a code of business conduct and ethics, and its financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["10-K," sec.gov, February 4, 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm)

**Synthesis:**
MAA scores highly on Fisher's 15 points, reflecting its strong position as a leading apartment REIT in the high-growth Sunbelt region. The company's strengths lie in its long runway for growth, commitment to reinvestment in its portfolio, strong operational platform, and experienced management team. The primary factor that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the impact of new apartment supply in its key markets, which could pressure rent growth and occupancy, potentially affecting profit margins. Evidence of continued strong performance in the face of this new supply, such as sustained high occupancy and positive rent growth, would reaffirm the company's competitive advantages and strengthen its score.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
