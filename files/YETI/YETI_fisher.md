Synthesis: YETI scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its strong brand, proven ability to innovate and expand its product lines, and a solid financial position. The primary areas of uncertainty are the lack of specific data on R&D effectiveness and labor relations. The score could be most impacted in the next 12-24 months by the success of its international expansion and new product launches, as well as its ability to maintain its premium pricing in a competitive market. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosure on R&D spending and its return on investment. Similarly, more transparency on employee satisfaction and retention metrics could change the "No" on labor relations.

fisher score is 13 / 15
