Company: Rollins, Inc. (ROL)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Q2 2025 Earnings Presentation, and various earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins operates in the global pest control industry, a market with steady demand driven by recurring needs for residential and commercial services. The company's Q1 2025 revenues grew 9.9% to $822.5 million, with 7.4% organic growth, indicating strong ongoing demand. The market is largely non-discretionary as pest control is essential for health and safety. Growth drivers include climate change, which can expand pest ranges, and increasing urbanization. Rollins is also expanding its global footprint and making strategic acquisitions, such as Saela Holdings, LLC in April 2025, to enter new markets and increase density in existing ones.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins has a long history of growth through acquisitions, which it uses to enter new markets and add density. In Q1 2025 alone, Rollins completed 4 acquisitions. The company also focuses on improving operational efficiency through technology. While specific R&D figures for new pest control methods are not detailed, the company's consistent growth and margin improvement efforts suggest a commitment to process development. The CEO has also spoken about modernizing the business from a parent company standpoint to better support its various brands.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a service-based company, Rollins' R&D is not comparable to a technology or pharmaceutical firm. The company does not disclose specific R&D spending. Innovation is more focused on operational improvements, such as routing software, digital customer interaction tools, and more effective and environmentally friendly pest control application techniques. The lack of specific disclosures on R&D spending and outcomes makes it difficult to assess its effectiveness relative to the company's size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins' consistent revenue growth, including a 7.3% organic increase in Q2 2025, points to a strong sales function. The company serves over 2.8 million customers through a multi-brand strategy, including well-recognized names like Orkin. This allows Rollins to target different market segments effectively. The company continues to invest in growth initiatives, with selling and marketing costs increasing in Q1 2025 to support its sales efforts.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Q1 2025, Rollins reported a gross profit margin of 51.4% and an operating income margin of 17.3%. For Q2 2025, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 23.1%. These are strong margins for a service-based business. The company has a history of consistent profitability, demonstrating the value of its services and its ability to manage costs effectively.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGxJBpzbrp_rbdEs_j-MwWeOCzHYiPcO_6aK7cDksUr3A8eEFnJuqVvbAnN3TY-__8lKdNf48b7GezQf-ALAhylHpdT5GQ1t8aZPVxJxCFWvtYJSDOChhl4mmDXXywSMRV7WXDM3cHI1LI6pbHKobqniw5e-st760yXKdT4_d6l8oPquUH-T3PoqKKVhnkyB3XTSL2_qcLdm11aGsAJoVP0i4UF0O7p91RJH0amtbSO0ChC6kP0PhOfaccaGpd-_SqkVZH-tj8jTfxDLyZavHQ=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGxJBpzbrp_rbdEs_j-MwWeOCzHYiPcO_6aK7cDksUr3A8eEFnJuqVvbAnN3TY-__8lKdNf48b7GezQf-ALAhylHpdT5GQ1t8aZPVxJxCFWvtYJSDOChhl4mmDXXywSMRV7WXDM3cHI1LI6pbHKobqniw5e-st760yXKdT4_d6l8oPquUH-T3PoqKKVhnkyB3XTSL2_qcLdm11aGsAJoVP0i4UF0O7p91RJH0amtbSO0ChC6kP0PhOfaccaGpd-_SqkVZH-tj8jTfxDLyZavHQ=) (July 24, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins is focused on pricing and productivity to drive margin expansion. In Q1 2025, the company noted that pricing more than offset inflationary pressures. They also saw leverage in employee expenses, materials and supplies, and insurance and claims. While there was some margin compression in Q2 2025 due to higher insurance and claims expenses, the company's focus on cost control in other areas is evident.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGxJBpzbrp_rbdEs_j-MwWeOCzHYiPcO_6aK7cDksUr3A8eEFnJuqVvbAnN3TY-__8lKdNf48b7GezQf-ALAhylHpdT5GQ1t8aZPVxJxCFWvtYJSDOChhl4mmDXXywSMRV7WXDM3cHI1LI6pbHKobqniw5e-st760yXKdT4_d6l8oPquUH-T3PoqKKVhnkyB3XTSL2_qcLdm11aGsAJoVP0i4UF0O7p91RJH0amtbSO0ChC6kP0PhOfaccaGpd-_SqkVZH-tj8jTfxDLyZavHQ=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGxJBpzbrp_rbdEs_j-MwWeOCzHYiPcO_6aK7cDksUr3A8eEFnJuqVvbAnN3TY-__8lKdNf48b7GezQf-ALAhylHpdT5GQ1t8aZPVxJxCFWvtYJSDOChhl4mmDXXywSMRV7WXDM3cHI1LI6pbHKobqniw5e-st760yXKdT4_d6l8oPquUH-T3PoqKKVhnkyB3XTSL2_qcLdm11aGsAJoVP0i4UF0O7p91RJH0amtbSO0ChC6kP0PhOfaccaGpd-_SqkVZH-tj8jTfxDLyZavHQ=) (July 24, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins' investor materials and website highlight positive employee testimonials and a focus on career development. However, these are curated by the company. The company's 10-Q does not mention any significant labor disputes or unionization issues. Without more independent data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations, it's difficult to definitively say relations are "outstanding." The Better Business Bureau has logged a number of customer complaints, some of which mention dissatisfaction with service technicians.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership team appears stable. The 10-Q from March 31, 2025 does not indicate any major board disputes or executive turnover. The company has a clear succession plan, as evidenced by the promotion of Jerry Gahlhoff Jr. to CEO. Executive compensation is tied to performance, aligning their interests with shareholders. There is no evidence of significant executive strife.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins operates numerous brands, many of which have their own leadership teams. This decentralized structure suggests a deep bench of operational managers. The company's ability to successfully integrate acquisitions also points to a capable management team below the executive level. The promotion of the current CEO from within the company is another positive indicator of management depth and succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEYCXdsQs4l5FP4YmJkIRRpvzC-rTfdOpQtQxYyVmPNFzLUmROZmSqIIWY_6JgUjlOHEcH0-M1o-ftAmdS6xTy-UDaBxFz5Kax7mCKN67JWYkNdZ2-yv_kwI4kvNbh4p9MMg8y61yw=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEYCXdsQs4l5FP4YmJkIRRpvzC-rTfdOpQtQxYyVmPNFzLUmROZmSqIIWY_6JgUjlOHEcH0-M1o-ftAmdS6xTy-UDaBxFz5Kax7mCKN67JWYkNdZ2-yv_kwI4kvNbh4p9MMg8y61yw=) (October 21, 2023)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the Q1 2025 10-Q states that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The company provides a good level of detail in its financial reporting, including revenue breakdowns by service line. There is no recent history of major restatements or internal control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In pest control, key competitive advantages include brand recognition, route density, and customer service. Rollins' portfolio of strong brands, led by Orkin, gives it a significant marketing advantage. The company's acquisition strategy is focused on increasing route density, which improves efficiency and profitability. The recurring nature of pest control services also creates a sticky customer base, providing a stable revenue stream.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFc0cWjgdVg2gL--cSf-HXy79yt4USfXUMxzMt0LCXn9ccxnV4yyq4bIoJPZqBrc7qSQYCTLiDeapCBk7zyD0lrWbHJIH2Xfx9a7AQoo5NocEjApFgD7avFPY6gP-j8hur_o229Ssn1Q1XYyfFxgJWeFU0bwjssbU8ZmR1SqMFInbT3R_ZX9Alq2uKhoCFGPxdntRBXzWYe](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFc0cWjgdVg2gL--cSf-HXy79yt4USfXUMxzMt0LCXn9ccxnV4yyq4bIoJPZqBrc7qSQYCTLiDeapCBk7zyD0lrWbHJIH2Xfx9a7AQoo5NocEjApFgD7avFPY6gP-j8hur_o229Ssn1Q1XYyfFxgJWeFU0bwjssbU8ZmR1SqMFInbT3R_ZX9Alq2uKhoCFGPxdntRBXzWYe) (April 29, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins' strategy of growth through acquisition, combined with steady investment in its existing brands, indicates a long-term focus. Management's commentary in earnings calls and presentations consistently emphasizes sustainable growth and market leadership. The company has a history of consistent dividend payments and a share repurchase program, but these have not come at the expense of reinvesting in the business. The company's willingness to invest in marketing and sales to drive organic growth, even if it slightly compresses near-term margins, is another indicator of a long-range view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Rollins had a strong balance sheet with $201.2 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company generates significant free cash flow, with $168 million in Q2 2025 alone. Rollins has a $1 billion revolving credit facility and a commercial paper program to fund acquisitions and other growth initiatives. While the company has a shelf registration on file, its primary funding sources for growth are cash flow and debt, not equity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins' management regularly hosts earnings calls and presents at investor conferences. Their presentations and transcripts show a willingness to discuss both positive results and challenges, such as the margin compression from higher insurance costs in Q2 2025. The company provides detailed financial information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, suggesting a commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of major scandals, fraud, or significant related-party transactions that would call into question the integrity of Rollins' management. The company is under investigation in California regarding hazardous waste disposal, but the 10-Q states that they do not believe the outcome will have a material effect. This is a potential red flag, but without a negative outcome, it is not definitive evidence of a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025)

Synthesis:
Rollins, Inc. scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strong market potential, a commitment to growth, and robust financials. The company's key strengths lie in its recurring revenue model, strong brand portfolio, and disciplined approach to acquisitions. The two "No" answers are for R&D effectiveness and labor relations. For R&D, this is largely due to the nature of the business and a lack of specific disclosures. For labor relations, the lack of independent data makes it difficult to give a definitive "Yes." The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company provides more transparency on its innovation efforts or if more positive, independent data on employee satisfaction becomes available. Conversely, a negative outcome from the California investigation or a slowdown in organic growth could negatively impact the score.

fisher score is 13 / 15
