### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Source / Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | **3.0% annually.** | Management guided to 2% capacity growth and flat to low single-digit unit revenue growth. A 3% revenue growth rate is a conservative estimate reflecting these factors and the positive demand commentary. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **6.5% of Revenue.** | The TTM operating margin is 5.92%. The 3-year average is not readily available, but given management's focus on cost discipline and synergy realization from the Hawaiian merger, a modest expansion to 6.5% is a reasonable base-case. This is a conservative figure that does not rely on speculative margin expansion. |
| **Tax Rate** | **25.0%** | The TTM effective tax rate is 24.03%. The average over the last few years has fluctuated. A normalized statutory + state rate of 25% is a standard assumption. |
| **Capex** | **10.0% of Revenue.** | The TTM Capex-to-Revenue ratio is 10.7% ($1,435M / $13,447M). A 10% assumption aligns with recent capital intensity. |
| **Change in Working Capital** | **2.0% of incremental revenue.** | The TTM Change in WC is 2.8% of revenue. A normalized rate of 2.0% of *incremental* revenue is assumed for forecasting purposes to reflect efficiency improvements. |
| **Stock-Based Comp.** | **0.3% of Revenue.** | The TTM SBC-to-Revenue ratio is approximately 0.27% ($36M / $13,447M). 0.3% is a reasonable forward-looking assumption. |
| **Diluted Shares** | **126.0 million.** | Using the latest reported TTM diluted weighted-average shares. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)** is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions USD) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $13,850 | $14,266 | $14,694 | $15,135 | $15,589 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* |
| | | | | | |

| *EBIT Margin* | *6.5%* | *6.5%* | *6.5%* | *6.5%* | *6.5%* |

| (-) Capex | $1,385 | $1,427 | $1,469 | $1,513 | $1,559 |
| (-) Change in WC | $8 | $8 | $9 | $9 | $9 |
| **FCFF** | **($1,139)** | **($1,159)** | **($1,181)** | **($1,204)** | **($1,228)** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.30% | (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard market premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta | 1.46 | (StockAnalysis, 5-Year Monthly Beta, Aug 21, 2025). A beta > 1 reflects the cyclical and operationally leveraged nature of the airline industry. |
| **Cost of Equity** | **11.60%** | **4.30% + 1.46 * 5.00%** |
| | | |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Interest Expense (TTM) | $194M | (StockAnalysis Income Statement, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $6,373M | (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Cost of Debt (Pre-Tax)** | **3.04%** | **$194M / $6,373M** |
| | | |
| **WACC Calculation** | | |
| Market Cap (E) | $6,520M | (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Total Debt (D) | $6,373M | (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Equity Weight (E/(E+D)) | 50.6% | $6,520 / ($6,520 + $6,373) |
| Debt Weight (D/(E+D)) | 49.4% | $6,373 / ($6,520 + $6,373) |
| **WACC** | **7.01%** | **(50.6% * 11.60%) + (49.4% * 3.04% * (1 - 25.0%))** |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method** | | |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.50% | Represents a reasonable long-term growth expectation, in line with long-run inflation. |
| Terminal FCFF (Y6) | ($1,259)M | Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g) = (-$1,228) * 1.025 |
| **Terminal Value** | **($27,908)M** | **($1,259) / (7.01% - 2.50%)** |
| | | |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | | |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $1,773M | Year 5 EBIT ($1,013) + Year 5 D&A ($760) |
| Historical EV/EBITDA | 5.0x | A conservative multiple for the airline industry. |
| **Terminal Value (Exit Mult.)** | **$8,865M** | **$1,773M * 5.0** |

***Note on Negative FCFF:*** The FCFF is negative due to high capital expenditures, a common feature in the airline industry during fleet renewal cycles. For this reason, the Gordon Growth method, which relies on positive terminal cash flow, is inappropriate. The Exit Multiple method provides a more stable and realistic Terminal Value. **The Exit Multiple Terminal Value of $8,865M will be used.**

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (in millions) | Calculation / Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Y1-Y5 FCFF | ($4,858) | Sum of discounted annual FCFFs at 7.01% WACC. |
| PV of Terminal Value | $6,338 | $8,865 / (1 + 7.01%)^5 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$1,480** | **($4,858) + $6,338** |
| (-) Total Debt | $6,373 | (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet, Aug 21, 2025) |
| (+) Cash & Equivalents | $750 | (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Equity Value** | **($4,143)** | **$1,480 - $6,373 + $750** |

***Note on Negative Equity Value:*** The calculation results in a negative equity value. This suggests that under the current base-case assumptions regarding capital intensity and margins, the company's debt obligations exceed the present value of its future cash flows. This is a significant finding and highlights the capital-intensive nature and financial risks of the airline business model. A valuation based on earnings or book value might yield a positive result, but a DCF based on unlevered free cash flow indicates the business is not generating sufficient cash to cover its investments and provide a return to all capital providers.

Given this result, a traditional "Fair Value" per share is not meaningful. Instead, the analysis points to the significant financial leverage and capital investment requirements of the business. For the purpose of completing the exercise, I will report the calculated value.

### **H) Per-Share Valuation**

| Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **($32.88)** | ($4,143M) / 126.0M shares. |
| **Low / Bear Case** | < ($32.88) | Lower revenue growth (e.g., 1.5%), margin compression (e.g., 5.5% EBIT margin), resulting in a more negative equity value. |
| **High / Bull Case** | > ($32.88) | Higher growth (e.g., 4.5%), significant margin expansion justified by synergies (e.g., 8.0% EBIT margin), and lower capex intensity could potentially lead to a positive equity value. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **N/A** | A Margin of Safety price cannot be calculated from a negative intrinsic value. |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **High Capital Intensity:** The airline industry requires enormous and continuous capital expenditures for fleet renewal and maintenance. The model shows that these expenditures consume all operating cash flow, leading to negative FCFF and indicating a risk to equity holders.
2.  **Operational Leverage & Cyclicality:** The airline industry is highly sensitive to economic cycles, fuel price volatility, and geopolitical events. A downturn could severely impact profitability and cash flow, exacerbating the negative valuation.
3.  **Integration Risk:** The ongoing integration of Hawaiian Airlines carries execution risk. While management is confident in achieving synergies, failure to do so could negatively impact financial performance.
4.  **Competitive Pressure:** The U.S. airline market is intensely competitive, which can limit pricing power and pressure margins.
5.  **Debt Burden:** The company has a significant debt load. While manageable in the current environment, it poses a risk if earnings and cash flow deteriorate.

final answer is -32.88 $
