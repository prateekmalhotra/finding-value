### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III is strategically focused on its owned brands, DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, and Vilebrequin, which represented approximately 52% of net sales in fiscal 2025, up from 47% in fiscal 2024. The company is actively working to offset the exit of its Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses. The relaunch of Donna Karan in Spring 2024 was the company's most successful launch to date. The company is also expanding its licensed portfolio with new agreements for Nautica, Halston, Champion, Converse, and BCBG.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a stated priority to "Drive Growth of Our Owned Brands" and "Build Our Complementary Portfolio of Licensed Brands". The company has recently signed new licensing agreements with Converse and BCBG, with launches planned for Fall 2025. Additionally, G-III acquired the remaining interest in Karl Lagerfeld in fiscal 2023 to expand its global presence. G-III is also investing in its digital presence and international expansion, including an 18.7% stake in AWWG to accelerate European growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an apparel company, G-III's "R&D" is focused on design, sourcing, and marketing rather than traditional research and development. The company does not disclose specific R&D spending. However, its continued ability to secure licensing agreements with major brands and the successful relaunch of Donna Karan indicate effective product development and marketing.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III has a diversified distribution network, selling to approximately 1,600 customers, including major department stores, specialty stores, and online retailers. Sales to its ten largest customers accounted for 69.6% of net sales in fiscal 2025, indicating strong relationships with key retailers. The company is also expanding its direct-to-consumer business and international presence. However, the high customer concentration presents a risk.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal 2025, G-III reported a gross margin of 40.8% and an operating margin of 9.1%. Gross margin improved from 40.1% in fiscal 2024. The company has stated that owned brands generate higher operating margins as they do not have royalty fees. The shift in sales to owned brands positively impacted the gross profit percentage.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is focused on growing its higher-margin owned brands. In its Q1 2026 earnings call, management mentioned that they are working to offset tariff costs through diversifying the sourcing mix, vendor discounts, selective price increases, and other cost-saving initiatives. The company is also executing a turnaround strategy for its North American retail segment to improve profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 10-K states that G-III believes its relationships with its employees are positive and that it has not experienced any interruption to operations due to a labor disagreement. As of January 31, 2025, approximately 63% of the leadership team and 73% of the overall workforce are women. The company also supports The Social Justice Center at the Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) to increase opportunities for BIPOC individuals in the industry.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive management team has a long tenure. Morris Goldfarb, Chairman and CEO, has been with the company for over 50 years. Sammy Aaron, Vice Chairman and President, joined in 2005. Neal Nackman, CFO, has been with G-III for over 20 years, and Jeffrey Goldfarb, Executive Vice President, has been with the company for over 20 years. This stability suggests good executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the long-tenured top executives, the 10-K lists Dana Perlman as Chief Growth and Operations Officer, who joined in January 2024 with over 20 years of experience in the apparel industry. This addition suggests a focus on strengthening the management team.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, discloses a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to IT general controls at its KLH subsidiary. While management concluded this did not result in any material misstatements, it is a significant issue. The independent auditor issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025.
**Answer:** No

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's core competency is its well-developed sourcing and supply chain infrastructure, with relationships with vendors built over 40 years. This allows for competitive terms and market intelligence. The company's ability to act as a licensee for a wide range of major brands and also develop its own brands is a key differentiator. The recent strategic investment in AWWG to accelerate international growth is another positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is investing in its owned brands, relaunching Donna Karan, and entering new licensing agreements, all of which require upfront investment for long-term growth. The acquisition of the remaining interest in Karl Lagerfeld and the investment in AWWG also demonstrate a long-range focus. The company's share repurchase program also suggests a focus on long-term shareholder value.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of April 30, 2025, G-III had a net cash position of approximately $239 million and total liquidity of approximately $740 million. The company has a share repurchase program in place, having repurchased 800,000 shares for $20 million in Q1 2026. This strong financial position and commitment to buybacks suggest a low risk of dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the Q1 2026 earnings call, management openly discussed the challenges of tariffs and related macroeconomic conditions, leading them to withdraw net income and adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal 2026. This transparency, even when facing uncertainty, indicates a high degree of candor. The company's 10-K also clearly outlines risks, including the material weakness in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided documents of any significant legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of management. The company has a Code of Ethics and Conduct, and the long tenure of the executive team suggests a stable and well-regarded leadership.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**

G-III Apparel Group presents a compelling case based on Fisher's framework, scoring strongly on its brand strategy, management stability, and financial strength. The company's proactive approach to managing the exit of its major PVH licenses by focusing on its higher-margin owned brands like DKNY and Karl Lagerfeld, and the successful relaunch of Donna Karan, are significant positives. However, the analysis reveals a critical weakness in the company's accounting controls, with a material weakness identified at its KLH subsidiary.

The key variables that will likely influence the score over the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to remediate the material weakness in its internal controls, the performance of its new licensed brands (Nautica, Halston, Champion, Converse, and BCBG), and the successful international expansion of its owned brands through its partnership with AWWG. A successful resolution of the material weakness, demonstrated by a clean audit opinion in the next fiscal year, would flip the "No" on point 10 to a "Yes".

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
