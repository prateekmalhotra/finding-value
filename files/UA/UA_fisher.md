Under Armour, Inc. (UA), August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Under Armour Q1 2025 earnings report (for the quarter ended June 30, 2024), and related news coverage.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour operates in the large and growing global athletic apparel and footwear market. However, the company is currently struggling to capitalize on this potential. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, revenue was down 10% to $1.2 billion, with a 14% decrease in North America, its largest market. While there is some growth in Latin America, it is not enough to offset declines elsewhere. The company is in the midst of a "strategic rebuild" to "reconstitute a premium positioning" for its brand, but the current sales trajectory and a forecast of a low double-digit revenue decline for fiscal 2025 raise significant doubts about its ability to achieve sizable sales growth in the near future.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour's strategic rebuild is centered around four pillars: Product, Story, Service, and Team. The company states it is streamlining its product lines to prioritize high-performance innovations. However, there is a lack of specific, recent information about its R&D pipeline and investments. While the company's 2022 R&D spending was reported at $187.5 million, more current figures are not readily available. The ongoing sales decline suggests that recent product development has not been effective in driving growth.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour does not consistently disclose its R&D expenses, with some reports stating that the company did not have "meaningful R&D expenses" for the twelve months ending March 31, 2025. This contrasts with competitors like Adidas, which spent €151 million on R&D in 2023. The lack of significant and transparent investment in R&D, coupled with declining revenues, indicates that Under Armour's R&D efforts are not effective relative to its size and are not producing innovative products that resonate with the market.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour's sales performance has been poor, with a 14% revenue decline in North America and a 12% drop in direct-to-consumer (DTC) sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. E-commerce sales, a critical part of the DTC channel, fell 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (quarter ended December 31, 2023) as the company pulled back on promotions. The persistent decline in sales across key channels and regions indicates an underperforming sales organization.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour's gross margin increased to 47.5% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. However, the company reported an operating loss of $300 million for the quarter, largely due to a litigation reserve. Adjusted operating income was a mere $8 million. Compared to the high profitability of competitors like Nike and Adidas, Under Armour's margins are not currently worthwhile. Morningstar notes that competitors achieve operating margins of over 30% in some regions, far exceeding Under Armour's performance.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour is actively implementing a margin improvement plan. Key elements include reducing promotional activity, increasing product prices, and a significant restructuring that involves a 25% reduction in SKUs. The company is also targeting a 2% to 4% reduction in SG&A expenses in fiscal 2025. These initiatives are projected to improve gross margin by 75 to 100 basis points in fiscal 2025.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour promotes its commitment to diversity and inclusion through various initiatives and has received some workplace awards. However, the company faced allegations in 2018 of a "hedonistic" and "sexist" work culture, which it claims to have addressed. While some positive employee policies are in place, there is a lack of recent, independent evidence to confirm that the company has "outstanding" labor and personnel relations.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under Armour has experienced significant turnover at the CEO position. Kevin Plank, the founder, returned as CEO in April 2024, after Stephanie Linnartz stepped down after just one year. This follows the departure of Patrik Frisk in 2022. Such frequent changes at the top suggest instability and a lack of a clear, long-term vision. The board of directors also has a staggered structure, which can be seen as a negative from a corporate governance perspective.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The repeated return of the founder, Kevin Plank, to the CEO role suggests a lack of management depth and succession planning. While the company has other named executives, the high-profile departures at the CEO level create concerns about the stability and depth of the leadership team. There is no clear evidence of a strong bench of leaders being developed to take over key roles.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 annual report, Under Armour disclosed that it had revised prior period financial statements for accounting corrections related to cost of goods sold and SG&A expenses. While the company stated the impacts were not material, any restatement is a red flag regarding the quality of accounting controls. On the positive side, the company's auditor has not raised any major concerns in recent reports.
**Answer:** No

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the sportswear industry, brand strength, product innovation, and relationships with athletes and teams are crucial. Under Armour's brand has been diluted in recent years, and it has struggled to keep up with the innovation of competitors like Nike and Adidas. The company's recent performance, with declining sales and market share, suggests it is not as outstanding as its main rivals. Morningstar notes that Under Armour's association with American football gives it limited brand advantages in most international sports.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's current restructuring plan, which includes reducing SKUs and pulling back on promotions, is causing short-term pain in the form of lower revenue. This indicates a willingness to prioritize the long-term health of the brand and profitability over short-term sales figures. Management's commentary around the "strategic rebuild" and "premium positioning" also points to a long-range outlook.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** At the end of Q1 2025, Under Armour had $885 million in cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings outstanding under its $1.1 billion revolving credit facility. The company has a share repurchase program in place, having bought back $40 million of its stock in the first quarter. This indicates that the company is not currently facing a need for equity financing. The balance sheet appears strong enough to fund its operations and restructuring efforts without diluting shareholders.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its recent earnings calls and press releases, Under Armour's management has been open about the challenges the company is facing. They have clearly communicated the reasons for the sales decline and have provided a detailed outlook, including a projected revenue decline for the full fiscal year. This level of transparency, even in difficult times, suggests a commitment to candor with investors.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2021, Under Armour agreed to pay $9 million to settle SEC charges that it misled investors about its revenue growth. The SEC found that the company accelerated sales from future quarters to meet analysts' revenue estimates. While this settlement is a significant mark against the company's integrity, there have been no major new allegations since then.

Synthesis:
Under Armour is a company in the midst of a significant turnaround effort. The strongest positives are its clear plan for margin improvement, its long-range profit outlook, its strong balance sheet, and its candid communication with investors. However, these are overshadowed by a host of negatives, including declining sales, questionable R&D effectiveness, a weak sales organization, and low profitability. The company's management has also been unstable, and past accounting issues raise concerns about its integrity. The Fisher score will likely change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of the company's "strategic rebuild." Key variables to watch will be the sales trajectory, particularly in North America, and the gross margin performance. A return to sustainable revenue growth and a demonstrated improvement in profitability would be needed to flip the "No" answers on several key points.
