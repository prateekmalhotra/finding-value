### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** Global Payments operates a two-sided network connecting merchants and financial institutions, but it does not own the core card networks (Visa, Mastercard), which limits the strength of its direct network effects. The value for a new merchant is access to the global pool of cardholders, an advantage not proprietary to GPN. The planned acquisition of Worldpay will significantly increase its merchant base, potentially strengthening its scale and density, but the indirect nature of the network effect keeps the score moderate.
**Evidence:**
*   The company operates in "Merchant Solutions" and "Issuer Solutions," defining its role as an intermediary in the payments value chain. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   The announced acquisition of Worldpay aims to create a "pure play merchant solutions provider with significantly expanded capabilities, extensive scale and greater market access," which would enhance the merchant side of its network. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** GPN establishes moderate switching costs by deeply embedding its payment solutions into the operational software of its clients, including point-of-sale and business management systems. The use of multi-year contracts further solidifies these relationships. However, the industry is marked by intense competition and the rise of alternative integrated payment providers, which prevents customers from being fully locked in.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states that "the majority of our services are priced... under multi-year customer arrangements." (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   GPN's solutions are integrated into both company-owned point-of-sale systems and third-party partner software, making the payment function a critical and embedded part of a merchant's daily operations. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   As of March 31, 2025, the company had $3.57 billion in remaining performance obligations for contracts with a duration greater than one year, indicating a locked-in future revenue stream. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** The payment processing industry has high fixed costs related to technology, security, and compliance. GPN's massive scale allows it to spread these costs over a large transaction volume, creating significant operating leverage and a durable cost advantage over smaller rivals. The company is actively pursuing further cost efficiencies through a major transformation initiative.
**Evidence:**
*   Management notes that many operating expenses "do not vary directly with the level of payment transactions we process for our customers, generating operating leverage." (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   The company's business transformation initiative is expected "to generate more than $600 million of annual run-rate operating income benefit by the first half of 2027." (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   In Q1 2025, the adjusted operating margin expanded by 70 basis points to 42.4%, demonstrating effective cost management. (Global Payments Inc. Q1 2025 Earnings Call Summaries, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** GPN's intangible assets are substantial but are primarily composed of customer relationships and technologies gained through its aggressive acquisition strategy. The company does not possess a dominant consumer-facing brand or a portfolio of foundational patents that would grant it significant pricing power or competitive exclusion. Its assets are valuable but less durable than those of a company with stronger proprietary IP.
**Evidence:**
*   As of March 31, 2025, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets represented the majority of the company's total assets, at $35.1 billion of a total $47.6 billion. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   The primary classes of intangible assets are "Customer-related" and "Acquired technologies," reflecting their origin in business combinations rather than internal R&D. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** GPN utilizes a powerful and diverse distribution network that includes a large direct sales force, partnerships with financial institutions, and, critically, integrations with a wide array of independent software vendors (ISVs). This multi-pronged approach allows it to reach merchants of all sizes across numerous vertical markets efficiently. The scale of this network makes it a significant barrier to entry.
**Evidence:**
*   The company actively markets its solutions "directly to our customers and through a variety of partner distribution channels," including a "direct sales force worldwide, as well as referral partnerships." (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   The acquisition of Worldpay is explicitly intended to give the combined entity "extensive scale and greater market access." (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** While GPN processes an immense amount of transaction data, public filings lack evidence of a clear feedback loop where this data is refined into proprietary products that create a significant competitive advantage. The potential exists, but the company has not demonstrated that its data assets are unique or hard-to-replicate in a way that leads to higher retention or superior product offerings compared to peers.
**Evidence:**
*   The company describes itself as a "leading payments technology company," but the Management's Discussion and Analysis section does not specify how it monetizes its vast data sets beyond supporting its core processing services. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** GPN is fostering a growing ecosystem, particularly within its "Integrated and Embedded Solutions" business, by partnering with third-party software developers. This strategy creates a platform that connects merchants with specialized software, embedding GPN's services more deeply. The strong growth in this segment suggests positive momentum, though the ecosystem is not yet as mature or dominant as those of other platform-based companies.
**Evidence:**
*   The "Integrated and Embedded Solutions" business focuses on embedding payments technology into "business management software solutions owned by our technology partners." (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   This was the fastest-growing part of the Merchant Solutions segment, with revenue increasing 6.1% in Q1 2025, indicating successful partner adoption. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The payments industry is governed by a complex web of financial regulations, card network rules, and data security standards. These requirements create a significant barrier to entry for new firms, which benefits established players like GPN. However, these are industry-wide conditions rather than a unique advantage for GPN over its large-scale competitors like Fiserv or FIS.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's operations are subject to oversight from numerous regulatory bodies globally, covering areas like anti-money laundering, data privacy, and financial services, which imposes substantial compliance costs that deter new entrants. (Inferred from the nature of the business and standard industry disclosures)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** Competing at a global scale in payment processing requires massive, ongoing investment in specialized technology, secure data centers, and network infrastructure. The high capital expenditures and sunk costs required to build and maintain such a platform are a major deterrent to new competition.
**Evidence:**
*   The company projects capital expenditures of approximately $800 million for the full year 2025, demonstrating the high level of required investment. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   GPN's balance sheet includes $2.35 billion in net property and equipment as of March 31, 2025. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** GPN enjoys high revenue visibility due to its business model, which relies on multi-year contracts and transaction-based fees. This recurring revenue model, common in the industry, provides a stable and predictable financial foundation.
**Evidence:**
*   A majority of GPN's services are delivered through "multi-year customer arrangements." (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
*   The company reported a backlog of $3.57 billion in unsatisfied performance obligations related to its longer-term contracts as of March 31, 2025. (Global Payments Inc. Form 10-Q, May 6, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (3 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02)
= 0.54 + 0.45 + 0.60 + 0.24 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.24 + 0.18 + 0.16 + 0.08 = 3.09
**Final Weighted Numeric Score: 30.9 / 100**

### Mapping
The weighted score of 30.9 falls within the 30-50 range.
*   30 ≤ 30.9 < 50 → moat rating = 2
As this score is at the very low end of the range, and conservatism is required, the rating is a 2.

### Moat Duration Justification
The company's competitive advantages stem primarily from scale-driven cost advantages and moderate switching costs, which appear durable. The prevalence of multi-year contracts provides a 3-5 year visibility window.. The pace of technological change in fintech, particularly the rise of software-led and embedded payments, presents a medium-term threat that could erode switching costs over a 7-10 year horizon as merchants have more choices for integrated providers. Estimated moat duration is ~7–10 years.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Technological Disruption:** New payment technologies or platforms (e.g., from large tech companies or decentralized finance) could bypass traditional payment processors, eroding GPN's network relevance.
2.  **Software Integration Shift:** If ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) find it easier and more profitable to become payment facilitators themselves or switch between underlying processors more easily, GPN's embedded switching costs would diminish.
3.  **Regulatory Changes:** New regulations promoting open banking or real-time payment networks could reduce barriers to entry and increase competition, compressing GPN's margins.

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Net Retention Rate:** A decline would indicate weakening switching costs.
*   **Adjusted Operating Margin:** Sustained compression would signal an erosion of cost advantages.
*   **Revenue Growth in Integrated/Embedded Solutions:** A slowdown relative to the market could mean its ecosystem strategy is failing.
*   **Customer Churn Rate:** An increase would be a direct measure of declining customer loyalty and moat strength.
*   **Capital Expenditures as % of Revenue:** A significant, sustained increase without corresponding revenue growth could indicate a commoditizing industry requiring defensive investment.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Global Payments Inc. possesses a moderate moat built on the foundations of efficient scale, which confers a meaningful cost advantage, and moderately high switching costs derived from its integrated software and multi-year contracts. While the company is a critical part of the global commerce infrastructure, it lacks powerful, proprietary assets like a dominant brand or network effect that would warrant a higher rating. The final score is conservative, reflecting a highly competitive and rapidly evolving industry. A successful integration of Worldpay that demonstrably accelerates revenue growth and expands margins would be the most likely catalyst to justify a higher rating.

moat rating is 2 / 5
