Company, August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpaWorld's growth is directly tied to the cruise industry, which has a multi-year pipeline of new, larger ships scheduled for delivery. The company has exclusive, long-term agreements with major cruise lines like Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian Cruise Line, representing a significant barrier to entry. As of December 31, 2024, their contracts covered 98% of the ships in their cruise line partners' fleets. This captive audience, combined with rising consumer spending on wellness, provides a clear path for sustained sales growth as passenger counts increase. The company's revenues increased 12% for the six months ended June 30, 2025, driven by operating on more ships and higher guest spending.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on expanding its offering of higher-margin "medi-spa" services and introducing new wellness treatments and technologies. In its 2024 10-K, the company states its strategy includes "continuing to innovate our offerings with new and exciting services and products." Recent earnings calls have highlighted the introduction of new treatments and capital investments to equip health and wellness centers on new cruise ships, demonstrating a commitment to evolving their service mix beyond traditional spa offerings. For example, capital expenditures were $18.3 million for the first six months of 2025, primarily for outfitting spas on new ships and renovating existing ones.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm) (Filed July 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a service-oriented company, OneSpaWorld does not have a formal Research and Development expense line item in its financial statements. Innovation is embedded within operating expenditures and is focused on service protocol development, staff training, and sourcing new products and equipment from third parties. While the company innovates its service menu (as noted in Point 2), there are no specific metrics like patents or R&D-to-sales ratios to benchmark its effectiveness against peers in a quantifiable way. Therefore, there is insufficient verifiable evidence to assess this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpaWorld's "sales organization" consists of its onboard spa staff who directly upsell services and retail products to a captive audience of cruise passengers. The company's key performance indicators, such as Total Revenue per Ship Day and Average Guest Spend, are direct measures of its sales effectiveness. For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, total revenues increased by 11.7% year-over-year, driven by an increase in capacity and "an increase in guest spending." This consistent ability to increase spend from a captive customer base, supported by extensive staff training, demonstrates a highly effective and specialized sales function.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm) (Filed July 31, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. For the second quarter ended June 30, 2025, OneSpaWorld reported an income from operations of $25.2 million on $228.3 million of revenue, yielding an operating margin of 11.0%. This is an improvement from the 10.1% operating margin reported for the full year 2024. This level of profitability is robust for a consumer service business and reflects the company's strong unit economics onboard cruise ships.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm) (Filed July 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins by shifting its service mix toward higher-value treatments like medi-spa and wellness services, which carry higher price points. The company's 2024 10-K explicitly states that a key strategy is to "drive revenue and profitability by enhancing our product and service offerings." Additionally, the company noted that its cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased in the first half of 2025 due to cost management initiatives and a higher mix of service revenues. This dual focus on premiumization and cost control is a clear effort to enhance profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm) (Filed July 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** OneSpaWorld's business model depends on its ability to recruit, train, and retain a large workforce of spa and fitness professionals willing to work at sea for extended periods. In its 2024 10-K, the company identifies "competition for qualified employees and other labor issues" as a material risk factor. While the company has successfully staffed its operations during the industry's post-pandemic ramp-up, the inherent challenges of this labor model and the lack of affirmative disclosures on metrics like employee turnover or satisfaction prevent a confident "Yes." The risk factors themselves suggest this is a persistent challenge rather than an area of outstanding strength.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior executive team has demonstrated stability. Leonard Fluxman (Executive Chairman) and Stephen Lazarus (CFO) have been with the company or its predecessors for many years, providing continuity. The addition of a new CEO in recent years has been integrated smoothly. There is no evidence from proxy statements or other filings of executive turnover, infighting, or unusual compensation practices that would suggest poor relations. The alignment of executive incentives with financial performance appears standard.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the top-level executives are experienced, there is limited public disclosure regarding the next layer of management responsible for key operational areas like recruitment, logistics, or cruise line relationships. The company's filings focus primarily on the named executive officers. The 2024 10-K mentions a dependency on key personnel: "Our success depends in large part upon the leadership and performance of our executive management team." This "key person risk" language, without further disclosure on succession planning or bench strength, suggests that management depth is not a clearly demonstrated strength.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's annual financial statements included in the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, received an unqualified audit opinion from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Furthermore, the 10-K includes a statement from management confirming the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting, with no material weaknesses identified. The financial statements provide a clear breakdown of primary costs (cost of revenues, salaries, administrative), indicating adequate controls and analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The most critical clue in this industry is the company's portfolio of long-term, exclusive contracts with the world's largest cruise lines. As disclosed in its 2024 10-K, agreements have an average remaining term of approximately four years. This creates a powerful moat, as it effectively locks out competitors from the most lucrative parts of the market. The ability to secure and maintain these near-monopolistic agreements for onboard wellness services is the single most important indicator of OneSpaWorld's outstanding competitive position.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. They make significant upfront capital expenditures to design and equip spas on new ships, which only generate returns over the multi-year life of the cruise ship contract. In the six months ended June 30, 2025, capital expenditures were $18.3 million. This willingness to invest heavily in new-builds and renovations, well ahead of realizing profits from those assets, shows a clear focus on securing long-term, durable revenue streams rather than maximizing short-term earnings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm) (Filed July 31, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong. As of June 30, 2025, OneSpaWorld had $42.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $63.7 million in cash from operating activities in the first six months of the year. The company is funding its capital expenditures through cash on hand and operating cash flow. Given the positive free cash flow generation and manageable debt levels, there is no indication that the company will need to raise equity to fund its growth, which primarily consists of outfitting new ships under existing contracts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025100906/osw-20250630.htm) (Filed July 31, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management communicates consistently through quarterly earnings calls and filings. A review of filings and transcripts from the COVID-19 pandemic, a time of extreme crisis for the cruise industry, shows that the company continued its public disclosures and discussed the challenges and its liquidity plans openly. In its current filings, the company is transparent about its key risks, including reliance on cruise lines and labor challenges. This consistent communication in both good and bad times demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings, including the sections on legal proceedings and corporate governance, reveals no material red flags. The 2024 10-K reports no material legal or regulatory actions against the company. There are no disclosed related-party transactions that suggest self-dealing, and the company has maintained an independent audit committee. The absence of such issues points to a management team with high standards of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1758488/000095017025024552/osw-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

Synthesis:
OneSpaWorld scores highly on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its dominant and protected position as the premier wellness provider to the cruise industry. Its primary strengths are a long growth runway tied to cruise capacity expansion, a highly effective captive-audience sales model, strong profit margins, and a solid financial position that obviates the need for dilutive financing. The main weaknesses identified are a lack of quantifiable R&D metrics (a structural issue for this type of service business) and insufficient disclosure on management depth and labor relations metrics. The score would most likely be impacted in the next 12–24 months by the renewal of major cruise line contracts; a successful renewal would reaffirm the company's moat, while any loss of a key partner would severely damage the investment thesis. To flip the "No" on management depth to a "Yes," the company would need to provide more color on succession planning and the executives below the named officer level.

fisher score is 12 / 15
