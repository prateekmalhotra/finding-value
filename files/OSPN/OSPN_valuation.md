### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | **3.07%** | Midpoint of 2025 guidance ($248M) over TTM revenue ($240.6M). (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 5, 2025). |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)**| **3.0%, 2.5%, 2.5%, 2.5%** | A gradual step-down from guided growth to a sustainable long-term rate. This reflects a conservative outlook based on recent single-digit historical growth. |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin**| **22.1%** | Based on the TTM operating margin of 22.13%. Held flat as management focuses on maintaining profitability alongside growth initiatives. (StockAnalysis.com, August 5, 2025). |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **20.0%** | Based on management's stated long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 3, 2025). |
| **D&A as % of Revenue**| **3.5%** | Average of the last 3 full years (2022-2024), which is more stable than the TTM figure. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **4.0%** | Average of the last 3 full years (2022-2024), reflecting ongoing compensation strategy. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue**| **3.7%** | Average of the last 3 full years (2022-2024), reflecting maintenance and growth investment. |
| **Change in WC as % of Δ Revenue** | **15.0%** | Based on the historical relationship between working capital changes and revenue changes, indicating investment needed to support growth. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash available to all capital providers.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $248.0 | $255.4 | $261.8 | $268.4 | $275.1 |
| **EBIT (22.1%)** | **$54.8** | **$56.4** | **$57.9** | **$59.3** | **$60.8** |
| Taxes (20.0%) | ($11.0) | ($11.3) | ($11.6) | ($11.9) | ($12.2) |
| **NOPAT** | **$43.8** | **$45.1** | **$46.3** | **$47.4** | **$48.6** |
| (+) D&A (3.5%) | $8.7 | $8.9 | $9.2 | $9.4 | $9.6 |
| (-) SBC (4.0%) | ($9.9) | ($10.2) | ($10.5) | ($10.7) | ($11.0) |
| (-) Capex (3.7%) | ($9.2) | ($9.4) | ($9.7) | ($9.9) | ($10.2) |
| (-) Δ in WC | ($1.1) | ($1.1) | ($1.0) | ($1.0) | ($1.0) |
| **FCFF** | **$32.3** | **$33.3** | **$34.3** | **$35.2** | **$36.0** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | | **Ke = Rf + β \* ERP** |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.30% | U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield. (YCharts, August 20, 2025). |
| Beta (β) | 1.12 | Reflects slightly higher volatility than the market, which is reasonable for a tech company. (MarketBeat, August 20, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP)| 5.00% | Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **9.90%** | `4.30% + 1.12 * 5.00%` |
| | | |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | | |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 5.00% | Estimated based on risk-free rate plus a credit spread, as interest expense is negligible. |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 4.00% | `5.00% * (1 - 20.0%)` |
| | | |
| **WACC** | | **WACC = (E/V \* Ke) + (D/V \* Kd\*(1-t))** |
| Market Cap (E) | $528.9 M | (MarketBeat, August 20, 2025). |
| Market Value of Debt (D)| $9.4 M | (StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet, August 5, 2025). |
| Total Value (V) | $538.3 M | `528.9M + 9.4M` |
| **WACC** | **9.81%** | `(528.9/538.3 * 9.90%) + (9.4/538.3 * 4.00%)` |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method** | | **TV = (FCFF_Y5 \* (1+g)) / (WACC - g)** |
| Terminal FCFF | $36.9 M | `$36.0M * (1 + 2.5%)` |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g)| 2.5% | Assumed to be in line with long-term inflation expectations. |
| **Terminal Value** | **$504.8 M** | `$36.9M / (9.81% - 2.5%)` |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | **$315.6 M** | `$504.8M / (1 + 9.81%)^5` |
| | | |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| | |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $70.4 M | `EBIT_Y5 ($60.8M) + D&A_Y5 ($9.6M)` |
| Assumed EV/EBITDA | 7.0x | A conservative multiple for a stable, low-growth software company. |
| **Terminal Value** | **$492.8 M** | `$70.4M * 7.0` |

The Gordon Growth method and the Exit Multiple method yield similar terminal values. The slightly lower value from the Exit Multiple method will be used for conservatism. PV of Exit Multiple TV = `$492.8M / (1+9.81%)^5` = **$308.1M**.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Y1-5 FCFF | $138.8 M | `PV($32.3) + PV($33.3) + ... + PV($36.0)` |
| PV of Terminal Value | $308.1 M | Calculated above using the Exit Multiple method. |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$446.9 M** | `$138.8M + $308.1M` |
| (-) Total Debt | ($9.4 M) | (StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet, August 5, 2025). |
| (+) Cash & Equivalents | $92.9 M | (StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet, August 5, 2025). |
| **Equity Value** | **$530.4 M** | `$446.9M - $9.4M + $92.9M` |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity Value | $530.4 M | Calculated above. |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding| 39.3 M | (StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement, August 5, 2025). |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$13.50** | `$530.4M / 39.3M` |
| | | |
| **Valuation Range** | | |
| **Low/Bear Case: $9.50** | Assumes 1% revenue growth, 18% EBIT margins, and a 6.0x exit multiple, reflecting competitive pressure and execution challenges. |
| **High/Bull Case: $18.00**| Assumes 5% revenue growth declining to 3%, 24% EBIT margins from operating leverage, and an 8.0x exit multiple. |
| **Margin of Safety (30%) Price**| **$9.45** | `$13.50 * (1 - 0.30)` |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The digital security and e-signature markets are highly competitive, with larger players and nimble startups that could pressure pricing and market share.
2.  **Transition Risk:** The company is transitioning from hardware and perpetual licenses to a subscription-based model. This shift can cause short-term revenue lumpiness and requires successful execution to drive long-term recurring revenue growth.
3.  **Technological Disruption:** The pace of technological change in cybersecurity is rapid. A failure to innovate or adapt to new standards (like FIDO) could render existing products obsolete.
4.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** A slowdown in global economic activity could reduce IT budgets for enterprises and financial institutions, slowing sales cycles and growth.
