Laureate Education, Inc., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, and various earnings call transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate Education operates in the higher education markets of Mexico and Peru, which are characterized by a significant and growing imbalance between the supply and demand for quality, affordable higher education. The company's 2024 10-K notes that the higher education markets in Mexico and Peru are underpenetrated compared to the United States. The growth of the middle class and the clear value proposition of higher education in terms of increased earnings potential are expected to continue to drive demand. Laureate's focus on high-demand fields like medicine, health sciences, engineering, IT, and business, which constitute approximately 70% of its post-secondary enrollments, positions it well to capitalize on these trends. The company's strategy includes expanding its program offerings, increasing capacity at existing campuses, and growing its online and hybrid programs to meet this unmet demand.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate's management has demonstrated a clear commitment to ongoing development through its strategic initiatives outlined in its 2024 10-K. The company is focused on leveraging and expanding its existing portfolio by adding new programs and course offerings, particularly in the health sciences. There is a significant emphasis on expanding online and hybrid education programs to meet growing student demand and improve capital efficiency. The company aims to have 40% to 60% of student credit hours delivered online, supported by a common learning management system across its universities. This is further evidenced in their Q1 2025 earnings call transcript where they discuss investments in digital marketing and data analytics to improve student recruitment and retention.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate does not report R&D as a separate line item, which is typical for the education sector. However, its effectiveness in developing new programs and delivery methods can be inferred from its strategic focus and results. The 2024 10-K highlights the company's ability to leverage its in-country networks to rapidly deploy new, standardized curricula, lowering development costs and improving quality. The company has successfully expanded its online and hybrid offerings, a key area of investment and development. While direct R&D spending figures are not available, the consistent growth in organic enrollment suggests that the company's investments in curriculum and technology are effective in meeting market demand.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate's "sales" function is its student recruitment and marketing. The company has shown consistent organic enrollment growth, with a 10% increase in Mexico and a 6% increase in Peru in 2023, as noted in the 2024 10-K. This growth is supported by sophisticated analytical techniques to identify underserved student populations and targeted digital marketing strategies. The company's high retention rate, averaging 79% over the last five years, further indicates the effectiveness of its recruitment and the quality of its student experience. The company's increasing advertising expenses, as detailed in the 2024 10-K, show a commitment to this function.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm (February 20, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year 2024, Laureate reported revenues of $1,566.6 million and an operating income of $374.0 million, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 23.9%. This represents an improvement from the 22.8% operating margin in 2023. The company's Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.7% in 2024, up from 28.2% in 2023. These strong and improving margins indicate a worthwhile profit margin, especially given the private-pay model in which it operates.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate is actively pursuing margin improvement through several initiatives. The company's 2024 10-K highlights its focus on operational leverage through scaled, in-country networks that allow for shared infrastructure and technology. The expansion of online and hybrid programs is a key strategy for improving capital efficiency and classroom utilization. Furthermore, the company leverages unified systems and centralizes common services like IT, finance, and procurement to enhance efficiency. These actions, combined with careful management of tuition pricing, contribute to maintaining and improving profit margins.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K details a comprehensive approach to human capital management. It highlights positive employee engagement survey results, with an overall engagement score of 73% in Mexico (up from 72%) and 84% for the US-based corporate team (up from 70%). The company offers significant tuition discounts for employees and their families, as well as ongoing training and development programs. There are no mentions of significant labor disputes in the SEC filings. These factors suggest a positive and stable relationship with its workforce of over 31,800 employees.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm (February 20, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025036830/laur-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate's 2024 10-K notes that the Board of Directors receives regular reports on talent development and succession planning, and the executive team participates in coaching and development programs. The executive team appears stable, with no recent high-profile departures mentioned in the filings. The Compensation Committee works with external consultants to ensure compensation is benchmarked against industry standards, aligning executive interests with the company's performance. Senior leaders participate in a long-term equity incentive program, further aligning their interests with shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm (February 20, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025036830/laur-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s organizational structure, as described in the 2024 10-K, includes leadership at both the corporate and country levels, suggesting a decentralized management structure that empowers local leaders. The "Human Capital" section of the 10-K mentions succession planning as a topic regularly reviewed by the Board. The company's ability to operate effectively across different institutions and countries points to a capable and deep management team beyond the CEO.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm (February 20, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 Form 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from the independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's own report also concluded that internal controls were effective. The financial statements provide a detailed breakdown of costs by segment, indicating a robust cost analysis system. There is no mention of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the recent filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm (February 20, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025036830/laur-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate possesses several key competitive advantages specific to the higher education industry in its markets. The 2024 10-K highlights the strong brand recognition of its institutions, such as UVM and UNITEC in Mexico, and UPC and UPN in Peru, which are ranked among the best in their countries. A significant clue to its quality is the operation of 23 medical and nine dental schools, which are difficult to obtain licenses for and signal high academic standards. Many of its institutions have earned high ratings from QS Stars™, an external assessment methodology, particularly in areas like "Employability," which is crucial for students in these markets. This focus on career outcomes is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate's status as a Public Benefit Corporation (PBC), as stated in its 10-K, inherently requires a long-range outlook, balancing stockholder interests with the public benefit of providing quality education. Management's strategy focuses on sustainable, long-term growth through investments in new programs, campus expansions, and digital infrastructure. These investments, such as the target of having 40-60% of credit hours online, may require upfront costs but are aimed at long-term efficiency and market expansion. This long-term perspective is also evident in their continuous capital expenditures to support growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generates strong and consistent cash flow from operations, reporting $232.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $135.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and access to a $155.0 million revolving credit facility. Instead of issuing equity, the company has been actively returning capital to shareholders through stock repurchase programs. A $100 million stock repurchase program was announced in September 2024. This strong financial position and commitment to buybacks indicate a low risk of equity dilution to fund growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm (February 20, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025036830/laur-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed quarterly and annual reports, and holds regular earnings conference calls with investors and analysts. The "Risk Factors" section in the 2024 10-K is extensive and candidly discusses a wide range of potential challenges, from regulatory risks to competitive pressures and cybersecurity threats. A review of the Q1 2025 earnings call transcript shows management openly discussing challenges such as foreign exchange headwinds and providing detailed explanations of their financial performance and strategic initiatives. This transparency suggests a culture of open communication with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LAUR/transcripts/ (May 1, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm (February 20, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025036830/laur-20250630.htm (July 31, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has established a clear governance structure, with its 2024 10-K referencing its Code of Conduct and Ethics available on its website. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 10-K and 10-Q does not reveal any material litigation or regulatory actions that would question management's integrity. The company's status as a Public Benefit Corporation further underscores a commitment to ethical conduct and social responsibility. The independent auditor issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements, and there are no reported governance red flags.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis**
Laureate Education, Inc. scores very highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a strong and well-managed business with significant competitive advantages in its core markets of Mexico and Peru. The company's key strengths lie in its long runway for growth due to favorable market dynamics, a clear commitment to developing its academic and digital offerings, strong brand reputation, and a robust financial model that generates healthy margins and cash flows. The management team appears stable, transparent, and focused on long-term value creation, as evidenced by its Public Benefit Corporation status and consistent return of capital to shareholders. The lack of significant legal issues and a clean bill of health on internal controls further solidify the impression of a high-integrity management team.

Looking ahead 12-24 months, the variables most likely to influence the score would be the successful execution of its digital strategy and sustained organic enrollment growth. A key factor will be the company's ability to maintain its pricing power and margins in the face of potential macroeconomic headwinds or increased competition in its markets. Continued positive trends in student enrollment and successful new program launches, especially in high-demand health sciences and online modalities, would reaffirm the 'Yes' answers. Conversely, a significant slowdown in enrollment, margin compression due to competitive pressures, or any major regulatory changes in Mexico or Peru could potentially change the score.

fisher score is 15 / 15
