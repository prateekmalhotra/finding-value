Frontdoor, Inc. (FTDR), August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed February 27, 2025, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Frontdoor operates in the U.S. home services industry, which it estimates to be a $500 billion market. The company's core home warranty business represents only about $4 billion of this total market, with an estimated 6% penetration of U.S. owner-occupied households, indicating substantial room for growth in its primary market. Frontdoor is expanding its addressable market by offering non-warranty services and, through the December 2024 acquisition of 2-10 Home Buyers Warranty (2-10 HBW), has become a leader in the new home structural warranty sector, adding another significant revenue stream. The company's 2024 revenue was $1.84 billion, a small fraction of the total opportunity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively developing new services and pursuing strategic acquisitions to expand beyond its core home warranty business. The company launched the Frontdoor app, which provides a "one-stop experience for home repair and maintenance using video chat, augmented reality and video collaboration tools," including virtual diagnosis to reduce in-home visits. The acquisition of 2-10 HBW in December 2024 demonstrates a commitment to entering adjacent markets like new home structural warranties. Furthermore, Frontdoor is expanding its non-warranty, on-demand services and forming partnerships, such as one with Moen to install smart water shut-off valves, to create new revenue streams.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Frontdoor does not disclose specific R&D expenditures, which are embedded within its selling and administrative expenses. However, the company's "Continuing Digital Innovation" strategy highlights its focus on technology-driven development. Outputs of this investment include a robust contractor technology platform with over 19,000 active users and a customer platform that processed over 50% of home warranty service requests online or via IVR in 2024. The development of proprietary technology that uses augmented reality for virtual diagnostics also serves as evidence of effective, albeit unquantified, R&D efforts aimed at improving efficiency and customer experience.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Frontdoor's sales model is built on strong, predictable recurring revenue, with 78% of 2024 revenue generated from existing customer renewals. The company maintains relationships with each of the top ten real estate brokers in the U.S., a critical component of its real estate sales channel. For its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel, Frontdoor utilizes sophisticated consumer analytics and dynamic pricing to effectively segment and target customers. The overall customer retention rate was 78.5% in 2024 (excluding the impact of the 2-10 HBW acquisition), demonstrating the effectiveness of its sales and retention programs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, Frontdoor achieved a gross profit margin of 54% (up from 50% in 2023) and a net income margin of 13% (up from 10% in 2023). The Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2024 was 24%, a significant increase from 19% in the prior year. These figures demonstrate strong profitability and a positive trend in margin expansion, indicating an ability to translate revenue into profits effectively.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively implementing several initiatives to improve margins. The company utilizes "dynamic pricing" in its renewal and DTC channels, allowing it to adjust prices based on proprietary data and local market characteristics. In 2024, contract claims costs decreased due to higher trade service fees (which lowers the number of service requests per customer), process improvements in contractor cost management, and favorable weather trends. Frontdoor also focuses on growing its "preferred" contractor network, which handles 85% of service requests and is more cost-effective, leading to lower costs and higher customer retention.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Frontdoor had 2,120 employees, none of whom were represented by a labor union, and states that "overall relations with our workforce are good." The company has adopted a virtual-first work environment and provides support for mental health and home office ergonomics. It discloses diversity metrics (63% female, 42% racially/ethnically diverse) and reports that it actively monitors employee engagement surveys to inform its HR strategy. While these are positive indicators, there are no specific, verifiable metrics like employee turnover or satisfaction scores provided to definitively benchmark relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no readily available information from primary sources detailing specific executive relations or succession planning. The company's proxy statements would offer more insight into board composition, tenure, and executive compensation alignment, but a comprehensive review is not possible with the provided documents. The 2024 10-K notes the loss of certain key employees from 2-10 HBW following the acquisition, which could suggest some integration challenges. Without more direct evidence of strong executive relations and a clear succession plan, this point cannot be confirmed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations website and SEC filings list the key executive officers, including a CEO, CFO, Chief Operating Officer, and leaders for legal and strategy. However, the provided documents do not offer significant detail on the management bench beyond the named executive team or discuss succession planning. While the company states it has an "Experienced Management Team," there is insufficient public information to assess the depth of operational leaders by segment or key person risk mitigations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 Form 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provided an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The report specifically mentions the "Accrual for Home Warranty Claims" as a critical audit matter, noting the complexity of the estimates, but ultimately found the controls effective. The company provides a detailed breakdown of revenue by channel and a clear analysis of changes in operating costs, suggesting robust internal controls and cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the home warranty industry is the scale and quality of the contractor network. Frontdoor has a nationwide network of approximately 17,000 contractor firms, with 85% of its work being done by its most cost-effective and highest-quality "preferred" contractors. This scale provides significant economies of scale in parts purchasing and contractor availability that smaller, regional competitors cannot match. The company's massive dataset from over 75 million service requests also provides a significant competitive advantage in pricing risk and managing claims costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025), https://investors.frontdoorhome.com/ (August 24, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions indicate a focus on long-term growth. The company is making significant investments in technology, such as the Frontdoor app and its contractor platform, which require upfront spending for long-term efficiency and market expansion. The acquisition of 2-10 HBW for $585 million is a major strategic investment aimed at diversifying revenue and creating cross-selling opportunities over the long term, rather than maximizing short-term profit. The company also invested in a brand relaunch for American Home Shield in 2024 to build long-term brand value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Frontdoor generates strong and consistent cash flow. In 2024, the company produced $270 million in net cash from operating activities and $231 million in Free Cash Flow. Instead of issuing shares, management is actively returning capital to shareholders through a significant share repurchase program, with a new $650 million authorization announced in July 2024. The company financed its large acquisition of 2-10 HBW through debt, not equity. This demonstrates a financial capacity and management philosophy that strongly favors avoiding equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K provides a detailed and candid discussion of the risks and challenges facing the business. For example, it openly discusses the negative impact of the "challenging real estate market" on its real estate channel sales and acknowledges the continued impact of inflation on its costs. It also discloses specific challenges, such as the loss of some key personnel after the 2-10 HBW acquisition. This level of transparency in its primary disclosure document suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K and other risk factors does not reveal any material legal or regulatory actions that would question the integrity of the senior management team. The company's financial statements have received an unqualified audit opinion, and there is no history of major restatements or scandals. While it is impossible to be certain without a deep background check, the publicly available information presents no red flags regarding management's integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1727263/000095017025028375/ftdr-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)

---
Synthesis:
Frontdoor scores well on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting strong fundamentals in its market position, profitability, and financial management. The company's key strengths lie in its dominant position within the large and underpenetrated home services market, its robust recurring revenue model, and its effective use of technology and scale to build a competitive moat through its contractor network. The financial discipline is clear from its strong cash flow, margin improvement initiatives, and commitment to shareholder returns via buybacks rather than dilutive financing. The primary weaknesses identified are a lack of public information regarding management depth, succession planning, and verifiable metrics on employee relations. The score could change in the next 12–24 months based on the successful integration of the 2-10 HBW acquisition and the ability to realize cross-selling synergies. A "No" could flip to "Yes" for management depth if the company provides more detailed information on its leadership bench and succession plans in future proxy statements or investor communications.

fisher score is 12 / 15
