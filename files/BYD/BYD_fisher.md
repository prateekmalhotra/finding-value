Boyd Gaming Corporation, August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K, 10-Q), earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming's growth is tied to expansion in existing and new markets, particularly online gaming. The company operates in the U.S. regional casino market, which is mature, but has a strategic partnership with FanDuel, a leader in the growing U.S. online sports betting and iGaming market. Additionally, Boyd continues to invest in expanding and enhancing its existing properties to attract more customers. For example, the company is developing a new land-based casino in Mississippi to replace one of its riverboat casinos.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming has demonstrated a commitment to reinvesting in its properties and pursuing new growth opportunities. The company's 2025 strategic plan includes significant capital expenditures for property expansions and technological upgrades. Management has also been active in M&A, having acquired regional gaming assets in the past. Their partnership with FanDuel for online gaming and sports betting is a key part of their strategy to expand beyond their traditional brick-and-mortar operations.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming does not have a formal R&D department in the traditional sense, as is typical for a casino operator. However, the company does invest in technology and innovation to improve the customer experience and operational efficiency. Their most significant "R&D" effort is their partnership with FanDuel, which has allowed them to participate in the high-growth online gaming market without bearing the full cost of developing their own platform. This has been a capital-efficient and effective way to enter the online space.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925004757/bgc20241008_10k.htm']

**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming's "sales" are driven by its marketing and loyalty programs. The company's "B Connected" loyalty program is a key tool for driving repeat business and attracting new customers.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925023972/bgc20250630_10q.htm']

**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming has a stable and experienced executive team. Many of the company's key executives have been with the company for over a decade. The company has a clear succession plan in place, with the current CEO, Keith Smith, having been with the company since 2008. This stability and experience are a positive for the company.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming has a deep and experienced management team. The company's executive team includes individuals with extensive experience in the gaming and hospitality industries.

**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925004757/bgc20241008_10k.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming provides detailed financial reporting, including segment-level data for its three operating divisions. The company's auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, has not identified any material weaknesses in the company's internal controls over financial reporting.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925004757/bgc20241008_10k.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd's focus on the "locals" market in Las Vegas provides a stable and recurring revenue stream that is less susceptible to tourism trends than the Las Vegas Strip. Additionally, their geographically diversified portfolio of regional properties reduces their reliance on any single market. The partnership with FanDuel is a key differentiator, giving them exposure to the high-growth online gaming market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925004757/bgc20241008_10k.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming's capital allocation strategy demonstrates a balance between returning capital to shareholders and investing in long-term growth. The company has a consistent share repurchase program and pays a regular dividend, but also invests in high-return projects to expand and upgrade its properties. Their investment in the FanDuel partnership is a clear example of prioritizing long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925023972/bgc20250630_10q.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming has a strong balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow. As of June 30, 2025, the company had over $300 million in cash and a net leverage ratio of 2.8x, which is reasonable for the industry. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through buybacks, not issuing new shares. Their current financial position is more than adequate to fund their growth plans without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925023972/bgc20250630_10q.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming's management team has a reputation for being transparent and accessible to investors. They provide detailed commentary on their quarterly earnings calls and at investor conferences. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, they were candid about the challenges they faced in some of their markets and the steps they were taking to address them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BYD/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of Boyd Gaming's management. The company has a strong compliance record and has not been the subject of any major scandals or controversies. A review of recent SEC filings and news archives does not reveal any red flags.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925004757/bgc20241008_10k.htm']

Synthesis:
Boyd Gaming scores highly on the Fisher checklist, with strengths across the board in management quality, financial discipline, and strategic positioning. The company's stable and experienced leadership team has a proven track record of execution. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the performance of the online gaming segment through the FanDuel partnership, and the company's ability to continue to grow its land-based operations in an increasingly competitive market. A significant downturn in the US economy could also negatively impact the score, as regional gaming is sensitive to consumer discretionary spending.

fisher score is 15 / 15
