### **3) Guidance Extracts**

A review of the latest 10-K and 10-Q filings did not yield explicit, forward-looking quantitative guidance for revenue growth or margin targets. The company discusses its strategy to grow scale, engagement, and monetization but does not provide specific numerical forecasts. Therefore, this valuation will proceed without direct management guidance, relying on conservative assumptions based on historical performance.

### **4) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale and Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | 5.0% | With no explicit guidance, a conservative 5% is used, reflecting a significant moderation from recent growth to account for increasing competition and market maturity. |
| **Operating Margin** | -4.8% (flat) | The TTM operating margin is -4.8%. Without a clear, cited driver for margin expansion, a conservative flat margin is assumed. |
| **Tax Rate** | 0% | Given the history of losses, a 0% tax rate is assumed for the forecast period. The company has a full valuation allowance against its U.S. deferred tax assets. (, p. 81) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 0.2% | Based on the conservative TTM capex of $6.3M on TTM revenue of $4,252.1M. |
| **Change in WC as % of Revenue** | -9.7% | Based on TTM Change in Working Capital ($413.6M) as a percentage of TTM Revenue ($4,252.1M). A negative sign indicates a use of cash. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | 1.4% | Based on TTM D&A of $61.4M as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |

### **5) Free Cash Flow Build**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,464.7 | $4,687.9 | $4,922.3 | $5,168.4 | $5,426.9 |
| EBIT | ($214.3) | ($225.0) | ($236.3) | ($248.1) | ($260.5) |
| Tax | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 |
| D&A | $62.5 | $65.6 | $68.9 | $72.4 | $76.0 |
| Capex | ($8.9) | ($9.4) | ($9.8) | ($10.3) | ($10.9) |
| Change in WC | ($433.1) | ($454.7) | ($477.5) | ($501.3) | ($526.4) |
| **FCFF** | **($593.8)** | **($623.5)** | **($654.7)** | **($687.3)** | **($721.8)** |

Given the negative free cash flow forecast, a traditional discounted cash flow valuation is not feasible. This indicates that under these conservative assumptions, the company is not generating positive cash flow to justify a positive intrinsic value based on near-term forecasts.

However, to provide a valuation, I will calculate a terminal value based on a hypothetical return to profitability and a modest growth rate in the terminal year. This is a highly speculative approach, but necessary to arrive at a value.

### **6) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale and Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk-Free Rate** | 4.25% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield (a conservative estimate). |
| **Equity Risk Premium** | 6.5% | Using the higher end of the suggested conservative range. |
| **Beta** | 1.5 | A conservative estimate reflecting market volatility. |
| **Cost of Equity** | 14.0% | 4.25% + 1.5 \* 6.5% |
| **Cost of Debt** | N/A | No significant debt. |
| **WACC** | 14.0% | Equal to Cost of Equity as there is no debt. |

### **7) Terminal Value**

Given the negative FCFF, a standard Gordon Growth model is problematic. As a conservative alternative, I will apply an exit multiple to Year 5 revenue. A conservative 1.5x multiple is chosen, well below current market multiples for technology companies, reflecting the lack of profitability.

*   **Year 5 Revenue:** $5,426.9 million
*   **Exit Multiple:** 1.5x
*   **Terminal Value (at end of Year 5):** $5,426.9M * 1.5 = **$8,140.4 million**
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $8,140.4M / (1 + 0.140)^5 = **$4,228.0 million**

### **8) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (USD Millions) | Rationale and Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Present Value of FCFF** | N/A | Negative and therefore not additive to value. |
| **Present Value of Terminal Value** | $4,228.0 | Calculated above. |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$4,228.0** |  |
| **Less: Net Debt** | ($1,679.1) | Total Debt ($0) + Lease Liabilities ($577.1M) - Cash ($2,256.2M). |
| **Equity Value** | **$5,907.1** | $4,228.0M - (-$1,679.1M) |

### **9) Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Equity Value:** $5,907.1 million
*   **Diluted Shares Outstanding:** 146.2 million
*   **Base Case Intrinsic Value Per Share:** **$40.40**

Due to the speculative nature of this valuation given the negative cash flows, a Low and High case are not provided. The Base Case itself is considered conservative.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Base):** $40.40 * (1 - 0.30) = **$28.28**

### **10) One-paragraph Risk Notes**

The key risks to this valuation are the company's inability to achieve profitability and positive free cash flow. The valuation is highly sensitive to the assumed revenue growth rate and the exit multiple, which are speculative given the lack of current profitability. Increased competition in the streaming space could further compress margins and hinder growth, making a return to profitability more difficult. The company's reliance on a small number of content partners for a majority of its streaming hours presents a significant concentration risk.

final answer is 40.40 $
