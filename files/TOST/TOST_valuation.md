### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | **27.0%**. Based on management's full-year guidance for 29% growth in key gross profit segments, slightly moderated for the total revenue figure. | (Q2 2025 Transcript) |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)** | **22%, 18%, 15%, 12%**. A gradual step-down from the guided rate, reflecting the law of large numbers and increasing market penetration over time. | Analyst Estimate |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **4.0% in Y1, expanding by 50 bps annually to 6.0% in Y5**. Starts slightly above the TTM margin of 3.6% and expands modestly, reflecting operating leverage as the company scales. This is a conservative interpretation of the strong adjusted EBITDA guidance. | (StockAnalysis, Q2 2025 Transcript) |
| **Tax Rate** | **21.0%**. A standard U.S. corporate tax rate is assumed as the company is now profitable on a GAAP basis. The historical effective rate is not meaningful due to prior losses. | Analyst Estimate |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **1.0%**. In line with the TTM average of 1.03%. | (StockAnalysis) |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **4.0% declining to 3.0%**. Starts near the TTM level of 4.3% and declines based on management's commentary on managing SBC. | (Q2 2025 Transcript) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.0%**. Consistent with the TTM average of 0.9%. | (StockAnalysis) |
| **Change in NWC as % of Δ Revenue** | **-2.5%**. Based on the TTM Change in NWC ($142M) / Change in Revenue ($5,529M TTM - $3,865M Prior TTM), reflecting an efficient cash conversion cycle. | (StockAnalysis) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is calculated to discount the future free cash flows.

| Component | Value / Calculation | Source / Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.29% | (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, Aug 20, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.00% | (Standard Market Assumption) |
| Beta (β) | 2.01 | (MarketBeat, Aug 20, 2025) |
| *Formula: Ke = Rf + β \* ERP* | *14.34%* | *4.29% + 2.01 \* 5.00%* |
| | | |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | | |
| Interest Expense / Avg Debt | 3.00% (pre-tax) | Inferred, negligible debt currently |
| Tax Rate | 21.0% | Assumed |
| *Formula: Kd (after-tax)* | *2.37%* | *3.00% \* (1 - 21.0%)* |
| | | |
| **Capital Structure** | | |
| Market Cap (E) | $26,166 M | ($42.41 price * 617 M shares) |
| Total Debt (D) | $19 M | (StockAnalysis, Aug 5, 2025) |
| Weight of Equity (E/V) | 99.9% | |
| Weight of Debt (D/V) | 0.1% | |
| | | |
| **WACC** | | |
| *Formula: (E/V \* Ke) + (D/V \* Kd)* | **14.33%** | |

### **F) Terminal Value**
The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model.

| Component | Value / Calculation | Rationale / Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Terminal FCFF (Y5 FCFF) | $191 M | From FCFF table |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.5% | Long-run inflation expectation, conservative cap. |
| WACC | 14.33% | From WACC calculation |
| **Terminal Value** | **$1,643 M** | *Formula: (Y5 FCFF \* (1+g)) / (WACC - g)* |
| | | |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | | |
| Y5 EBITDA (EBIT+D&A) | $911 M | ($781M EBIT + $130M D&A) |
| Assumed EV/EBITDA Multiple | 15.0x | A reasonable multiple for a mature software/fintech company. |
| Implied Terminal Value | **$13,665 M** | ($911M \* 15.0) |

*Judgement:* The Gordon Growth method produces a significantly lower (more conservative) terminal value than the exit multiple method. In accordance with the instructions, the **lower value of $1,643 M is used**.

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case Fair Value** | **$3.08** | **Equity Value ($1,898 M) / Diluted Shares (617 M)** |
| **Low / Bear Case** | **~$1.50** | Slower revenue growth (e.g., starts at 20%), flat 3.5% EBIT margin. |
| **High / Bull Case** | **~$5.50** | Faster revenue growth (e.g., starts at 30%), EBIT margin expands to 7.5%. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)**| **$2.16** | **Base Case ($3.08) \* (1 - 0.30)** |

### **Risk Notes**
The valuation is highly sensitive to long-term growth and profitability assumptions. Key risks to this base-case thesis include: 1) **Competition:** Intense competition from both legacy POS providers and new fintech entrants could pressure take rates and growth. 2) **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a platform tied to restaurant sales (GPV), a significant consumer spending downturn would negatively impact revenue. 3) **Profitability Path:** The model assumes steady margin expansion; however, continued investment in international expansion and new verticals could delay or reduce GAAP profitability. 4) **High Valuation Multiples:** The current stock price implies very high growth and margin expectations, creating significant downside risk if execution falters.

final answer is 3.08 $
