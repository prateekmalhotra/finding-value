Legacy Education Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed on August 8, 2024, and Forms 10-Q filed on January 22, 2024, May 7, 2024, and August 14, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Legacy Education Inc. is a provider of career and life skills education, including financial education, real estate investing, and personal development. The company's revenue has been declining, as stated in its latest 10-Q filing. The company's revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2025, was $1.7 million, a decrease of 32% compared to the same period in 2024. The company has stated that it is seeking to expand its offerings, but there is no concrete evidence of significant market potential for a sizable increase in sales.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Legacy Education has stated its intention to "expand our education and training curriculum," but provides no specific details on a product development roadmap, R&D spending, or new product pipeline in its recent SEC filings. The company's focus appears to be on maintaining its current offerings rather than on significant innovation or expansion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company does not report any research and development expenses in its financial statements. This indicates a lack of formal R&D efforts, which is a significant concern for a company in the education and technology space.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales have been declining significantly, as evidenced by a 32% decrease in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the prior year. The 10-K mentions a reliance on independent contractors and online marketing, but provides no metrics to suggest an above-average sales function.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm, August 14, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Legacy Education has a history of net losses. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, the company reported a net loss of $0.3 million on revenues of $1.7 million. For the year ended March 31, 2024, the net loss was $3.8 million. The company's gross profit margin for the three months ended June 30, 2025 was approximately 35%, which is down from 48% in the prior year period.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm, August 14, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has implemented cost-cutting measures, including reductions in marketing and personnel expenses. However, these actions have not been sufficient to achieve profitability, and margins have continued to decline. There is no evidence of a clear, long-term strategy for margin improvement.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm, August 14, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information available in the company's filings to make a definitive assessment of its labor and personnel relations. The company has a small number of employees (18 full-time employees as of March 31, 2024), and there is no mention of any labor disputes. However, the lack of positive evidence prevents a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There have been recent changes in the executive team. For example, the company appointed a new Chief Financial Officer in May 2024. While management changes are not inherently negative, they can indicate instability. Without further information, it is difficult to assess the quality of executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224045782/form10-q.htm, May 7, 2024]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a small company, Legacy Education has a limited management team. The 10-K lists only a few executive officers. This indicates a potential key-person risk. There is no information provided about succession planning.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's auditor, in the latest 10-K, expressed substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern. This is a major red flag regarding the company's financial stability and, by extension, its financial controls.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The for-profit education industry is highly competitive and subject to significant regulatory scrutiny. Legacy Education's declining revenues and lack of profitability suggest that it is not effectively competing in this challenging environment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's immediate focus is on survival, as evidenced by the "going concern" warning from its auditors. Management's discussion in the filings is focused on short-term measures like cost-cutting and maintaining operations, not on long-term investments for future growth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a history of using equity financing to fund its operations. Given its ongoing losses and negative cash flow, it is highly likely that Legacy Education will need to raise additional capital through equity offerings, which would dilute existing shareholders.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's SEC filings disclose its financial difficulties, including the "going concern" warning. However, there are no earnings call transcripts available for LGCY, which limits the assessment of management's candor in a live, unscripted format.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no legal or regulatory actions disclosed in the recent filings that would bring the integrity of the management into question. However, the lack of transparency in other areas (such as the absence of earnings calls) makes it difficult to give an unqualified "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm, August 8, 2024]

---
Synthesis: Legacy Education Inc. (LGCY) scores very poorly on Fisher's 15-point checklist. The company's declining revenues, consistent losses, and the "going concern" opinion from its auditor are all major red flags. The lack of R&D, a clear growth strategy, and management depth are also significant concerns. The score is unlikely to change in the next 12-24 months without a major strategic shift, such as a merger or acquisition, that brings in new management, a new product line, and a significant capital infusion. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" on several points if the company were to demonstrate a sustained period of profitable growth, provide a clear and detailed strategic plan for the future, and improve its transparency with investors.

fisher score is 0 / 15
