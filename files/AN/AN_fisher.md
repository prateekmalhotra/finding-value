Company: AutoNation, Inc. (AN), August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 Annual Report (10-K), Q1 & Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation is one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S., a mature but massive market. Growth avenues include expanding its higher-margin After-Sales business, growing its AutoNation USA used vehicle stores, and increasing the penetration of its captive finance arm, AutoNation Finance. The company is actively pursuing acquisitions to expand its footprint and offerings. While the core auto retail market is cyclical, the company's diversified revenue streams—including new and used vehicles, parts and service, and finance and insurance—provide multiple levers for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on expanding its non-franchised businesses, such as AutoNation USA used vehicle stores and AutoNation Mobile Service. The growth of AutoNation Finance is a key strategic initiative to capture more of the customer's vehicle ownership lifecycle and diversify income sources. The company also invests in digital capabilities to create a seamless omnichannel experience for customers, from online vehicle selection and financing applications to in-store pickup or home delivery.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an automotive retailer, AutoNation does not engage in traditional R&D in the same way a manufacturer would. Its "R&D" is more focused on process innovation, digital platform development, and service expansion. The company does not disclose specific R&D spending, as these costs are embedded within SG&A expenses. Therefore, it is not possible to quantitatively assess R&D effectiveness against peers based on available disclosures.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As one of the largest auto retailers, AutoNation's scale provides significant advantages. The company's focus on an omnichannel experience, allowing customers to complete significant portions of the transaction online, suggests a modern sales approach. In the first quarter of 2024, the company reported strong new unit growth and expanded used vehicle profitability, indicating effective sales execution.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, AutoNation reported a gross profit margin of 17.9% and an operating margin of 4.9%. The company's higher-margin After-Sales (parts and service) business contributed 46.2% of total gross profit, demonstrating a favorable business mix that supports overall profitability. While new and used vehicle margins can be cyclical, the After-Sales and Finance & Insurance segments provide a more stable, high-margin foundation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation is focused on growing its higher-margin businesses, particularly After-Sales and its captive finance arm. In the first quarter of 2024, the company achieved record After-Sales gross profit and expanded margin in this segment by 40 basis points year-over-year. The company also focuses on cost control and leveraging its scale to achieve operating efficiencies, such as centralizing administrative functions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGLVXd5I9CJZT0BQboQ6QQKyBgrMlbqvNRvztiWyzcWFNv6_u-iE2IJGrHap8E_u33nLK9Y26jVZ_0WtkwPvUd4aUR2tzcCpWcCM9QpUC3tqSIuvCMki7yf8In2tfn5_-C6QvQ6RHJ5a8zWRx9F](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGLVXd5I9CJZT0BQboQ6QQKyBgrMlbqvNRvztiWyzcWFNv6_u-iE2IJGrHap8E_u33nLK9Y26jVZ_0WtkwPvUd4aUR2tzcCpWcCM9QpUC3tqSIuvCMki7yf8In2tfn5_-C6QvQ6RHJ5a8zWRx9F) (April 25, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation states that its associates are its greatest asset and emphasizes creating an environment where all associates feel valued and respected. The company offers competitive compensation, benefits, and training programs. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 170 of its 25,100 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, indicating a low level of unionization. There are no widespread reports of significant labor disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, led by CEO Michael Manley, comprises individuals with extensive experience in the automotive industry. The company has a mix of long-tenured executives and newer leaders who have brought in external expertise. There is no public evidence of significant executive turnover or internal conflicts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's 2024 10-K lists a team of seven executive officers with clearly defined roles, including COOs for both franchised and non-franchised businesses. This structure suggests a clear division of responsibilities and a bench of senior leaders beyond the CEO. The company highlights its commitment to training and development to prepare future leaders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's financial statements are audited by a major public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, which provided an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for analysis of its various business lines. The use of a shared service center for key accounting and administrative activities suggests a focus on standardized and efficient controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's scale as one of the largest U.S. auto retailers provides significant competitive advantages in purchasing, advertising, and attracting talent. The company's diverse portfolio of domestic, import, and premium luxury brands reduces dependence on any single manufacturer. Its early and ongoing investment in a digital, omnichannel customer experience positions it well against both traditional dealers and online-only competitors. The development of a captive finance arm is a key differentiator that allows for greater profit capture and customer retention.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's capital allocation strategy is focused on growing long-term value per share. This includes investments in strategic initiatives like AutoNation Finance, AutoNation USA, and technology, which may require upfront costs but are aimed at sustainable future growth. Management's discussion in earnings calls and filings consistently highlights these long-term growth drivers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation generates strong operating cash flow and has a history of returning capital to shareholders through significant share repurchase programs rather than issuing new shares. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares for $460.0 million. The company's debt agreements and available liquidity appear sufficient to fund its capital allocation priorities, which include acquisitions and strategic initiatives, without needing to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation holds regular quarterly earnings calls with Q&A sessions for analysts, providing a consistent forum for communication. The company's filings detail risks and challenges, such as the impact of the CDK cyber incident in June 2024, where the company estimated a negative impact of approximately $1.75 per share. This disclosure of a specific negative event demonstrates transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/AN/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/AN/transcripts/) (July 25, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent, material legal or regulatory actions cited in the company's 2024 10-K that would suggest a lack of integrity at the senior management level. The company operates in a highly regulated industry and maintains a compliance framework. The Board's Audit Committee oversees risks, and the financial statements are audited by a reputable firm.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

---
Synthesis: AutoNation scores well on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its position as a scaled, well-managed industry leader with a clear strategy for long-term value creation. The company's strengths lie in its diversified business model, commitment to growing high-margin segments like After-Sales and finance, and strong financial discipline, evidenced by consistent share buybacks. The only "No" is due to the nature of its business as a retailer, where traditional R&D metrics do not apply. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the execution of its AutoNation Finance expansion and the pace of its acquisition strategy. A successful scaling of the finance arm, leading to demonstrable profit growth and higher customer retention, would further solidify the company's competitive advantage. Conversely, a significant downturn in the auto market or missteps in integrating acquisitions could pressure margins and growth.

fisher score is 14 / 15
