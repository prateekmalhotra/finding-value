**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's balance sheet was significantly impacted by the pandemic. The company took on a large amount of debt to survive the shutdown, and its debt levels remain elevated. While the company is generating positive cash flow, it will likely need to use a significant portion of its cash flow to pay down debt. This could limit its ability to fund future growth without resorting to equity financing.
**Answer:** No

The company provides detailed financial and operational data in its quarterly earnings releases and SEC filings. Management also holds regular conference calls with analysts, during which they provide a great deal of color on the business.

While the company has taken steps to address these issues, they do raise questions about the company's safety culture and overall integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

---
**Synthesis:**
Carnival Corporation & plc shows strength in its market position, brand portfolio, and commitment to long-term growth. The company has a clear path to increasing sales and is making efforts to improve its profit margins. However, its high debt load, and past safety incidents are significant concerns. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to pay down debt and improve its safety record. A significant reduction in debt and a clean slate of operations could turn the "No" for points 13 and 15 to a "Yes."
