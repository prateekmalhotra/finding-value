### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway

**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III is strategically focused on its owned brands, DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld, and Vilebrequin, which it sees as a significant growth driver. The company is expanding these brands into new product categories and international markets. For example, the relaunch of Donna Karan in North America during the spring of 2024 has shown strong initial results. Additionally, G-III has recently entered into several new licensing agreements for well-known brands like Converse and BCBG, with product launches planned for Fall 2025.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development

**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III has a stated strategic priority to drive the growth of its owned brands by expanding their lifestyle product offerings and global reach. The company is also actively seeking new licensing opportunities and acquiring established brands. Recent examples include licensing agreements with Nautica, Halston, Champion, Converse, and BCBG, and a strategic investment in AWWG, a global fashion group, to accelerate international growth. These actions demonstrate a commitment to developing new avenues for sales growth beyond its current portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III does not disclose specific R&D expenditures. However, its "commitment to ongoing development" is evident through brand acquisitions, new licensing agreements, and the successful relaunch of the Donna Karan brand. The company emphasizes its merchant expertise in product development and design, with in-house teams for each brand. The effectiveness of these efforts is demonstrated by the sales growth of its owned brands, which increased from 41% of net sales in fiscal 2023 to 52% in fiscal 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III has a diversified distribution network, selling to approximately 1,600 customers, including department stores, specialty stores, and mass merchants, as well as through its own retail stores and digital channels. The company has long-standing relationships with major retailers like Macy's, TJX Companies, and Ross Stores, which account for a significant portion of its sales. While this customer concentration is a risk, it also indicates a strong and established sales organization capable of managing large accounts. The company's continued expansion into international markets and new brands further suggests a capable sales force.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, G-III reported a gross profit margin of 40.8% and an operating profit margin of 9.1%. The gross margin improved from 40.1% in the prior year, attributed to a favorable product mix and a shift toward owned brands, which carry no royalty costs. While the operating margin is healthy, it is something to continue to monitor in a competitive industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's strategy to focus on its owned brands is a key driver of margin improvement, as these brands do not incur royalty fees. The company is also implementing a turnaround strategy for its North American retail segment, which is expected to reduce losses and improve profitability. Additionally, G-III is focused on diversifying its supply chain to mitigate the impact of tariffs and other cost pressures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III states in its 10-K that it believes its relationships with its employees are positive and that it has not experienced any interruption to operations due to labor disagreements. The company employs both union and non-union workforces. As of January 31, 2025, approximately 63% of the leadership team and 73% of the overall workforce are women. Without further evidence on employee turnover or engagement metrics, it is difficult to definitively assess the quality of labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at G-III has a long tenure, with the Chairman and CEO, Morris Goldfarb, having been with the company for over 50 years. Other key executives have been with the company for over 20 years. This stability suggests a cohesive and effective leadership team. The company recently hired a new Chief Growth and Operations Officer, Dana Perlman, who brings over 20 years of experience in the apparel industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management

**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's executive team includes a Chairman and CEO, Vice Chairman and President, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, and a Chief Growth and Operations Officer. While the top executives have extensive experience, the 10-K does not provide detailed information about the management bench beyond the named executive officers. The long tenure of the senior leadership could also imply a potential lack of succession planning.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, states that management concluded the company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. This weakness was identified within the KLH subsidiary and relates to information technology general controls. Although the company believes this weakness did not result in any material misstatements, it is a significant concern.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's expertise in managing a diverse portfolio of both owned and licensed brands is a key competitive advantage in the fashion industry. This model allows the company to cater to a wide range of consumers and distribution channels. The company's ability to successfully relaunch and grow iconic brands like DKNY and Donna Karan demonstrates its brand management capabilities. Furthermore, its extensive sourcing and supply chain infrastructure, built over 40 years, provides a competitive edge in a complex global market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's strategic priorities, as outlined in its 10-K, focus on long-term growth initiatives, such as building its owned brands, expanding its global reach, and diversifying its licensed brand portfolio. The company's significant investment in the relaunch of Donna Karan and its acquisition of the remaining interest in Karl Lagerfeld demonstrate a willingness to make substantial upfront investments for future profitability. These actions suggest a long-range view, even as the company navigates the near-term challenge of losing the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of April 30, 2025, G-III had $257.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $480 million available under its revolving credit facility. The company has a share repurchase program in place, under which it repurchased over 800,000 shares in the three months ended April 30, 2025. This indicates a strong cash position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders, rather than diluting them through equity financing. The company's primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and its credit facility, which appear sufficient for its current growth plans.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025008488/giii-20250430x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025008488/giii-20250430x10q.htm) (June 6, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's earnings call transcripts show a willingness to discuss both positive and negative aspects of the business. Management has been transparent about the challenges posed by the expiration of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses and has clearly articulated its strategy to mitigate the impact. The company's 10-K also discloses the material weakness in its internal controls, demonstrating a commitment to transparency even when the news is unfavorable.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided SEC filings of any legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of G-III's management. The company has a code of ethics and business conduct that applies to all employees and executive officers. The long tenure of the management team also suggests a stable and reputable leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm) (March 24, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:** G-III Apparel Group presents a mixed but generally positive picture according to Fisher's 15 points. The company's strengths lie in its strategic focus on high-potential owned brands, a commitment to developing new business through licensing and acquisitions, and a stable and experienced management team. The primary negatives are the lack of detailed disclosure on labor relations and management depth, and a significant material weakness in internal accounting controls. The most critical variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of the Donna Karan relaunch and the integration of new licensed brands to offset the loss of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses. A "No" on cost analysis and accounting controls would flip to a "Yes" with the remediation of the material weakness and a clean opinion on internal controls from their auditors.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
