Alphabet Inc., August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Alphabet Inc. Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Alphabet Inc. Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's core businesses operate in markets with substantial growth runways. The global digital advertising market is projected to grow from approximately $650 billion in 2025 to over $1.4 trillion by 2034, representing a CAGR of over 9%. Similarly, the global cloud computing market is forecasted to expand from approximately $781 billion in 2025 to over $2.2 trillion by 2032, a CAGR of over 16%. Alphabet's leadership in search, video (YouTube), and its position as a top-three cloud provider, coupled with its significant investments in artificial intelligence, positions it to capture a significant portion of this growth. The 2024 Form 10-K states, "We expect that this evolution will continue to benefit our business and our revenues."
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's commitment to ongoing development is evidenced by its substantial and consistent investment in R&D, which totaled $49.3 billion in 2024. The company's 2024 10-K states, "We have invested more than $150 billion in research and development in the last five years in support of these efforts." This is directed toward both improving core services and investing in new areas, most notably Artificial Intelligence. The "Other Bets" segment, while currently unprofitable, represents a portfolio of long-term initiatives in fields like autonomous driving (Waymo) and life sciences.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet’s R&D expense as a percentage of revenue was approximately 14.1% in 2024 ($49.3 billion in R&D on $350.0 billion in revenue). This is comparable to or higher than key competitors. In fiscal 2024, Microsoft's R&D-to-revenue ratio was 12%, while Amazon's is estimated to be in the 12-14% range. Apple's was lower at 7.8% in fiscal 2023. Given Alphabet's continued product innovation in AI, Search, and Cloud, and its ability to maintain market leadership, its R&D spending appears effective relative to its size and peers.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's sales organization is highly effective, particularly in its advertising and cloud segments. The self-service nature of Google Ads allows it to efficiently serve millions of small and medium-sized businesses. For larger clients and in the Google Cloud segment, the company has built a substantial direct sales force. Google Cloud revenues grew 32% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, driven by both infrastructure and platform services, indicating strong sales execution in a competitive enterprise market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm) (July 23, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet maintains strong profitability. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, the company reported an operating margin of 32%. The Google Services segment, its largest, is highly profitable with a 40% operating margin in the same period. While Google Cloud has historically been a drag on margins, it is now profitable, posting an operating margin of over 20%. The company's overall operating margin demonstrates significant pricing power and cost control.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm) (July 23, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on "durably re-engineering [its] cost base," as stated in the Q2 2025 earnings call. This includes optimizing technical infrastructure to lower the cost of serving AI queries, slowing the pace of hiring, and improving efficiency in real estate and other operational expenses. The company has also been focused on improving profitability in its Google Cloud segment, which has now achieved sustained operating profit. These actions have contributed to a stable and strong operating margin.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Alphabet offers competitive compensation and benefits, recent years have seen increased employee activism and tension. The Alphabet Workers Union was formed in 2021 to advocate for workers' rights, including for temporary, vendor, and contract workers. There have also been internal disputes and walkouts over issues such as sexual harassment, military contracts, and compensation. While employee satisfaction scores remain generally positive, the growing union presence and public disputes suggest that labor relations are not "outstanding" in the frictionless sense Fisher likely intended.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Alphabet appears stable, with long tenures for key leaders like CEO Sundar Pichai. The co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, remain on the board and retain voting control, providing a degree of long-term stability. There have been no recent, high-profile departures that would suggest significant discord at the senior-most levels. The 2024 10-K shows a consistent executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet has a deep bench of experienced executives leading its various segments. Beyond CEO Sundar Pichai, key leaders include Thomas Kurian (CEO of Google Cloud), and the heads of Search, YouTube, and other major divisions. The company's structure, which separates "Other Bets" into independent companies with their own leadership, also demonstrates a commitment to developing and empowering a broad base of executive talent. The 2024 10-K lists the executive officers, showing a well-structured team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet provides detailed segment reporting, breaking out revenues and operating income for Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets. This allows for a clear analysis of the profitability of its major business lines. The independent auditor's report in the 2024 10-K expressed an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. There is no history of major restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm) (July 23, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's primary competitive advantages are its massive user base and the resulting network effects, particularly in Search and YouTube. The company's vast data collection and analysis capabilities, refined over more than two decades, create a significant barrier to entry and a powerful engine for improving its AI models and ad targeting. This data-driven flywheel is a key differentiator and a sign of its outstanding position relative to competitors. The 2024 10-K notes the importance of "attracting and retaining users...largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet has a demonstrated history of prioritizing long-range growth over short-term profits. The continued investment in "Other Bets," which collectively lost over $4.4 billion in 2024, is a prime example. Similarly, the company's multi-billion dollar annual investments in AI research and development are aimed at securing long-term technological leadership, even at the expense of near-term margin maximization. This long-term orientation is a core part of the company's identity, as articulated in its founding documents and reiterated in shareholder communications.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000014/goog-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's financial position is exceptionally strong. As of June 30, 2025, the company held $95.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. It generates substantial free cash flow and has a robust share repurchase program, buying back $28.6 billion of stock in the first six months of 2025. Given its massive cash reserves and profitability, the risk of dilutive equity financing to fund growth is negligible.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652044/000165204425000062/goog-20250630.htm) (July 23, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is generally transparent in its quarterly earnings calls, providing detailed segment results and answering analyst questions. For example, in the Q2 2025 earnings call, executives addressed the challenges and costs associated with developing and deploying AI, as well as the competitive landscape. However, the company has also been criticized for a lack of transparency regarding certain controversies and the specifics of its various legal and regulatory challenges. While communication is regular and detailed on financial performance, it can be less forthcoming on more sensitive issues.
**Answer:** No

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet faces significant scrutiny over its integrity, primarily due to numerous antitrust lawsuits and regulatory investigations in the U.S. and Europe. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K details multiple cases alleging anticompetitive behavior in its Search, Ad Tech, and Play Store businesses. Past shareholder lawsuits have alleged that the company covered up sexual harassment by executives. While the company has a code of conduct and has recently agreed to a $500 million investment to overhaul its compliance structure, the sheer volume and severity of the legal and regulatory challenges it faces prevent a characterization of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**
Alphabet scores well on most of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market position, growth potential, financial strength, and commitment to innovation. Its core businesses are highly profitable and operate in expanding markets, and its balance sheet is fortress-like. The primary weaknesses identified are in the "softer" factors: labor relations, investor candor, and management integrity. While the company has been a desirable place to work, growing employee activism and unionization efforts suggest challenges ahead. The most significant variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the outcome of its numerous antitrust battles. A decisive loss, particularly one that forces structural changes to its business, could impact its long-term profitability and competitive position. To turn the "No" on integrity to a "Yes," the company would need to resolve these major legal challenges in its favor and demonstrate a sustained period of proactive compliance and transparency that goes beyond what is required by settlements.

fisher score is 12 / 15
