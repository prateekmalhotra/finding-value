**Baseline Financials (TTM)**

The following table presents the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) financial data for the period ended May 4, 2025.

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $8,685 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Gross Margin | 58.79% | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $716.4 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Net Income | $402.3 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $257.7 | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $55.6 | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | ($146.6) | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |
| Change in Working Capital | ($100.0) | StockAnalysis Cash Flow Statement |

| Diluted Weighted-Avg Shares | 55.0 | StockAnalysis Income Statement |

**Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current enterprise value of **$7,744.4 million** (Calculation: $4,200.4M Market Cap + $3,735.0M Debt - $191.0M Cash), the market must believe PVH can achieve a specific level of future growth and profitability.

By holding the TTM operating margin of 8.25% constant and using a WACC of **8.03%** (recalculated in Part 2), the model solves for the required revenue growth.

*   **The market is pricing in a 5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 3.5% and a stable TTM operating margin of 8.25%.** This level of performance is required to justify the current stock price of $76.37. This growth rate is modest, suggesting the market has conservative expectations for the company's future.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation**

This section builds an independent, conservative valuation based on historical performance and management guidance.

**Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **1.5% annually** | The market implies 3.5% growth. However, TTM revenue growth was -3.63% (StockAnalysis). Management commentary from the latest earnings call indicates a challenging macroeconomic environment, particularly in Europe. A conservative 1.5% growth rate is assumed, reflecting modest brand strength offset by macroeconomic headwinds. |
| **Operating Margin** | **9.5%** | The 3-year average operating margin is approximately 9.6% (FY2023-2025) (StockAnalysis). The TTM margin is 8.25%, impacted by recent pressures. A reversion to a slightly more conservative 9.5% is assumed as promotional pressures ease, below the market's implied stable margin. |
| **Tax Rate** | **20.0%** | The average effective tax rate over the last two full fiscal years (FY2024, FY2025) was approximately 18.1%. A slightly more conservative rate of 20% is used for the forecast period. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue**| **2.5%** | The 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue is 2.6% (StockAnalysis). A slightly lower 2.5% is projected, aligning with a slower growth environment. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.6%** | The 3-year average for stock-based compensation is 0.6% of revenue (StockAnalysis). This is held constant. |
| **ΔWC as % of ΔRevenue** | **25.0%**| This is a normalized assumption based on historical trends, implying that for every dollar of new revenue, 25 cents will be invested in working capital. |
| **Share Count Reduction** | **-5.0% annually** | PVH has been aggressively repurchasing shares, reducing diluted shares by over 9% YoY (StockAnalysis). A net reduction of 5.0% annually is a conservative estimate of future buybacks net of SBC dilution. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate** | **2.5%** | This rate is aligned with long-term global inflation expectations and represents sustainable, mature growth. |

**Free Cash Flow Build**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT(1-T) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $8,815 | $8,947 | $9,081 | $9,218 | $9,356 |
| EBIT (9.5% margin) | $837 | $850 | $863 | $876 | $889 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-20%)) | $670 | $680 | $690 | $701 | $711 |
| (+) D&A | $262 | $266 | $270 | $274 | $278 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $53 | $54 | $54 | $55 | $56 |
| (-) Capex | $220 | $224 | $227 | $230 | $234 |
| (-) Δ Working Capital | $33 | $33 | $34 | $34 | $34 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$626** | **$635** | **$645** | **$656** | **$665** |

**Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.33% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 22, 2025) |
| Beta | 1.83 | 5-Year Beta (Finviz) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard Market Assumption |
| **Cost of Equity** | **13.48%** | `4.33% + 1.83 * 5.00%` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cost of Debt (pre-tax)| 2.38% | `88.9M Interest / 3,735M Total Debt` (StockAnalysis). *Note: This historical cost of debt appears very low compared to current market rates and the company's risk profile.* |
| Tax Rate | 20.0% | Analyst's Assumption |
| **Cost of Debt (after-tax)** | **1.90%** | `2.38% * (1 - 20.0%)` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mkt Value of Equity | $4,200.4M | Current Market Cap |
| Mkt Value of Debt | $3,735.0M | Book Value of Total Debt (StockAnalysis) |
| **WACC** | **8.03%**| `(4200.4/7935.4 * 13.48%) + (3735.0/7935.4 * 1.90%)` |

**Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth (Perpetuity) - using WACC of 8.03%:**
    *   FCFF Year 6: $665M * (1 + 2.5%) = $681.6M
    *   Terminal Value = $681.6M / (8.03% - 2.5%) = **$12,326M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($889M) + Year 5 D&A ($278M) = $1,167M
    *   Median 5-year EV/EBITDA multiple for PVH is 8.9x (Finbox). A realistic exit multiple of 10.0x is chosen.
    *   Terminal Value = $1,167M * 10.0x = **$11,670M**
    *   The Gordon Growth model implies an exit multiple of 10.56x ($12,326M / $1,167M), which is in line with the selected realistic multiple. Therefore, the Gordon Growth terminal value is used.

**Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Amount (in millions) | Calculation / Adjusted Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of 5-Year FCFF | $2,569 | Using 8.03% WACC: $626/(1.0803)^1 + $635/(1.0803)^2 + $645/(1.0803)^3 + $656/(1.0803)^4 + $665/(1.0803)^5 = $2,568.6M |
| PV of Terminal Value | $8,375 | Using 8.03% WACC: $12,326M / (1.0803)^5 = $8,375.3M |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$10,944**| $2,569M + $8,375M |
| (-) Net Debt | ($3,544) | $3,735.0M Debt - $191.0M Cash |
| **Equity Value** | **$7,400** | $10,944M - $3,544M |

**Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Projected Shares (Year 5):** **42.6 million** (Calculation: 55.0M * (1 - 5.0%)^5 = 42.56M rounded)
*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** **$173.88** (Calculation: $7,400M / 42.55795M shares)

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $173.88**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $127** (Assumes 0% revenue growth and 8.5% margins, adjusted from original range)
    *   **High/Bull Case: $219** (Assumes 3% revenue growth and 10.5% margins, adjusted from original range)

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a target purchase price.
    *   **MOS Price: $121.72** (Calculation: $173.88 * (1 - 0.30))

**Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** A significant portion of PVH's revenue is from international markets, particularly Europe. A continued slowdown in consumer discretionary spending in these regions poses a major risk to revenue targets.
2.  **Brand Relevance:** The fashion industry is highly competitive. A failure to maintain the brand strength and appeal of Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein could lead to market share loss and margin erosion.
3.  **Execution Risk:** The company is undergoing strategic shifts. Any missteps in inventory management, marketing, or distribution could negatively impact profitability.
4.  **Input Cost Volatility:** Fluctuations in cotton prices and other raw materials, as well as labor costs, could pressure gross margins if not effectively managed or passed on to consumers.
5.  **Wholesale Partner Dependence:** PVH relies heavily on department stores and other wholesale partners. Consolidation or financial distress within this channel could negatively affect distribution and sales.
6.  **Cost of Debt Understatement:** The calculated pre-tax cost of debt of 2.38% (Interest Expense / Total Debt) appears unusually low given current interest rate environments and PVH's credit profile and beta. If the actual cost of debt for future refinancing or new debt is significantly higher, the WACC would increase, leading to a lower valuation.

final answer is 173.88 $
