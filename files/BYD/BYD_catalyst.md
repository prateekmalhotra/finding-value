### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

---

#### **1. Catalyst Title: Accelerated Share Repurchase Program**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Following the sale of its FanDuel stake, the company is increasing its target for quarterly share repurchases by 50% from $100 million to $150 million, beginning in the third quarter of 2025. The Board of Directors has also approved an additional $500 million for the program, bringing the total authorization to $707 million.
*   **Mechanism:** A larger, more aggressive buyback program reduces the number of outstanding shares, which directly increases Earnings Per Share (EPS). This action signals management's confidence that the stock is undervalued and is a tax-efficient way to return significant capital to shareholders, which should attract investors and positively impact the share price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026. The increased repurchase target is effective from Q3 2025 onwards.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company repurchases $125M per quarter. (Annualized: $500M)
    *   **Base Case:** The company meets its new target of $150M per quarter. (Annualized: $600M)
    *   **High Case:** The company utilizes the full remaining $707M authorization within the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). A $600M annual repurchase represents a significant portion of the company's market capitalization, providing strong and consistent demand for the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. Management has explicitly stated its intention to increase the repurchase pace, and the FanDuel sale provides ample liquidity to execute this plan.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must continue to generate sufficient free cash flow to support the buybacks without jeopardizing its leverage targets.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    1.  Quarterly cash flow statements to track "Shares repurchased and retired."
    2.  Form 10-Q/10-K disclosures on the remaining authorization under the share repurchase program.
    3.  Company announcements regarding further increases to the program.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  A significant market downturn could lead management to preserve cash instead of executing buybacks.
    2.  A large, unforeseen operational issue could divert capital away from the program.
    3.  Consistent insider selling could offset the positive signal from corporate buybacks.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The catalyst is clearly defined, well-funded, and has a high probability of execution in the near term, providing a strong support level for the stock.

#### **2. Catalyst Title: Norfolk, Virginia Casino Opening (Transitional Facility)**
*   **Type:** Operational / Regulatory
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Boyd Gaming is developing a new $750 million resort in Norfolk, Virginia, and plans to open a modest transitional casino in late 2025. This marks the company's entry into a new market ahead of the full resort opening in 2027.
*   **Mechanism:** The opening of the transitional facility will allow Boyd to start generating revenue and cash flow from the Norfolk market earlier than the main project's completion date. This event de-risks the project by establishing a market presence and can lead to upward revisions in forward revenue and earnings estimates.
*   **Timing:** Q4 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The transitional facility generates minimal EBITDAR ($5M-$10M annualized) due to a slow ramp-up.
    *   **Base Case:** The facility generates moderate EBITDAR ($15M-$25M annualized) and successfully builds a customer database for the full resort.
    *   **High Case:** Strong initial demand leads to higher-than-expected EBITDAR (>$30M annualized), creating positive momentum for the main project.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-10%). The primary value is in the full resort, but a successful early opening can create a positive narrative and bring forward future value.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The project has received city council approval and the company has laid out a clear timeline. Barring major construction or regulatory delays, the opening is highly probable.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Final regulatory approvals must be received on schedule. Construction must remain on track without significant delays or cost overruns.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    1.  Company press releases on construction milestones for the Norfolk project.
    2.  Local news reports out of Norfolk, Virginia, regarding the casino's progress.
    3.  Management commentary on earnings calls regarding the budget and timeline.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  Regulatory or construction delays pushing the opening into 2026.
    2.  Higher-than-expected pre-opening expenses.
    3.  Weaker-than-anticipated initial market reception.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor progress closely. The main catalyst is the full resort opening, but this near-term milestone provides a key indicator of execution capability.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

---

#### **1. Catalyst Title: Major Development Project Completions**
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Boyd is executing on a pipeline of significant growth projects, including the full $750 million Norfolk resort (late 2027), the new Cadence Crossing casino in Henderson, NV (mid-2026), and the expansion of the managed Sky River Casino (Phase 1: Q1 2026; Phase 2: mid-2027).
*   **Mechanism:** These projects, once complete and stabilized, will provide new, diversified streams of revenue and free cash flow. Their successful launch and ramp-up should lead to a step-change in the company's consolidated earnings and justify a higher valuation multiple as the company demonstrates a clear path to multi-year growth.
*   **Timing:** Q1 2026 – Q4 2027.
*   **Quantification (Illustrative Annualized EBITDAR Impact at Stabilization):**
    *   **Low Case:** Projects underperform, contributing a combined $60M in EBITDAR.
    *   **Base Case:** Projects meet expectations, contributing a combined $100M-$120M in EBITDAR.
    *   **High Case:** Projects exceed expectations, particularly Norfolk, contributing over $150M in EBITDAR.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). The successful execution of this entire pipeline could fundamentally increase the company's earnings power and market valuation over the next 5 years.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. While individual project timelines can shift, the company has a track record of completing projects. The primary uncertainty lies in the ultimate return on invested capital for each.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful management of construction budgets and timelines. Favorable economic conditions in the respective markets upon opening.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    1.  Quarterly updates on capital expenditure budgets and timelines for each project.
    2.  EBITDAR and margin performance of newly opened properties in their first 4-6 quarters.
    3.  Management commentary on returns on investment for each project.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  Significant cost overruns or construction delays.
    2.  A recessionary environment impacting consumer discretionary spending as new properties open.
    3.  New competition entering one of the target markets.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is the core long-term growth story for the stock. Investors with a multi-year horizon can buy based on the successful execution of this growth pipeline.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Accelerated Share Repurchase (Base Case)**
*   **Formula:** Price Impact ≈ (% of Market Cap Repurchased) / (1 - % of Market Cap Repurchased)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Shares Outstanding: 80.5 million (Q2 2025)
    *   Current Stock Price: $70 (for calculation purposes)
    *   Market Cap: $5.635 Billion (80.5M shares * $70)
    *   Base Case Annual Repurchase: $600 Million
*   **Calculation:**
    *   % of Market Cap Repurchased = $600M / $5.635B = 10.6%
    *   Price Impact ≈ 10.6% / (1 - 0.106) = **~11.9%** potential uplift from share reduction alone, not including the positive signaling effect.

**2. Major Development Projects (Base Case)**
*   **Formula:** Price Impact = (Present Value of New EBITDAR * Multiple) / Market Cap
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   New Annualized EBITDAR (Base Case): $110 Million [Inference]
    *   Assumed Valuation Multiple (EV/EBITDAR): 7.0x (conservative industry average)
    *   Discount Rate: 10% (for projects 2 years out on average)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Future Value of New Assets = $110M * 7.0 = $770 Million
    *   Present Value (2 years) = $770M / (1.10)^2 = $636 Million
    *   Price Impact = $636M / $5.635B Market Cap = **~11.3%** potential long-term value accretion.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term (0-12 months) catalyst balance for Boyd Gaming is strongly positive. The company's decision to monetize its FanDuel stake has unlocked significant financial flexibility, which is being immediately deployed into an aggressive share repurchase program. This provides a powerful and quantifiable driver for EPS growth and a strong support for the stock price. The opening of the transitional Norfolk casino in late 2025 serves as another positive, albeit smaller, milestone that de-risks the long-term growth story. The primary headwind is the observed pattern of insider selling, which suggests that executives may not see explosive upside from the current price, but this is outweighed by the sheer scale of the corporate buyback.

### **9) Evidence Matrix**

| Citation | Claim / Field Supported |
| :--- | :--- |
| | Development project timelines (Norfolk, Cadence, Sky River), Insider selling data (historical). |
| | Increased share repurchase target ($150M/qtr), new $500M authorization, Q2 2025 financial results, FanDuel transaction details. |
| | Online segment EBITDAR guidance ($50-55M for 2025), Q2 dividend ($0.18), shares outstanding (80.5M), Q2 share repurchase amount ($105M). |

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Economic Downturn:** A recession would significantly curtail consumer discretionary spending on gaming, negatively impacting cash flow from existing operations and jeopardizing the returns on new development projects.
2.  **Major Regulatory Shift:** Unfavorable changes in gaming laws or tax rates in key jurisdictions (like Nevada or a key Midwest state) could materially impair profitability and alter the investment thesis.
3.  **Failed Project Execution:** A major cost overrun, prolonged delay, or spectacular failure of the flagship Norfolk development project would destroy billions in capital and severely damage management's credibility.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

**Buy.** The investment thesis for Boyd Gaming is underpinned by a clear and powerful near-term catalyst: a management-directed, well-funded, and accelerated share repurchase program. This corporate action, fueled by the strategic monetization of the FanDuel stake, provides a potential upside of 10-20% in the near term. The single most important indicator to monitor will be the "Shares repurchased and retired" line item in subsequent quarterly reports to ensure the company is executing on its stated $150 million per quarter target.
