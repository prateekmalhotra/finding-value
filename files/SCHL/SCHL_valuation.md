### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,674.8 | $1,716.7 | $1,751.0 | $1,786.0 | $1,821.7 |
| **EBIT (4.50%)** | **$75.4** | **$77.3** | **$78.8** | **$80.4** | **$82.0** |
| NOPAT | $57.1 | $58.6 | $59.7 | $61.0 | $62.2 |
| (+) D&A | $46.9 | $48.1 | $49.0 | $49.0 | $51.0 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.29%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard market assumption)
    *   Beta: **1.18** (5-Year Beta). This reflects slightly higher volatility than the market, which is reasonable for a company in the competitive and evolving media/publishing industry. (StockAnalysis)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + (1.18 * 5.0%) = 10.19%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** (Interest Expense / Total Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   Cost of Debt = ($18.2M / $399.4M) * (1 - 0.2418) = **3.45%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): $649.85 Million (StockAnalysis)
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $399.4 Million (StockAnalysis)
    *   Total Capital (E+D): $1,049.25 Million
    *   **WACC = (649.85 / 1049.25) * 10.19% + (399.4 / 1049.25) * 3.45% = 7.62%**

---

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This is a reasonable long-term growth rate, in line with long-run inflation expectations and GDP growth.
    *   **Terminal Value = ($35.6 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0762 - 0.025) = $715.1 Million**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $82.0M + $51.0M = $133.0M
    *   Current EV/EBITDA Multiple: 12.43x (StockAnalysis). A 5-10 year median is not readily available, so the current multiple is used as a proxy, adjusted downward to be conservative.
    *   Assumed Exit Multiple: 7.0x (A conservative multiple given historical volatility)
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $133.0M * 7.0 = $931.0 Million
    *   The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative value and will be used.

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   $366.1 Million / 28.0 Million = **$13.08 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$13.08**. Assumes 3.0% initial revenue growth and 4.5% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$8.50**. Assumes 1.0% revenue growth and 3.5% EBIT margins, reflecting potential for continued margin compression.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$18.50**. Assumes 4.0% initial revenue growth and a return to 5.5% EBIT margins, reflecting successful cost management and new growth initiatives.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for estimation errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $13.08 * (1 - 0.30) = $9.16**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Margin Pressure:** The company's operating margins have been volatile. A failure to control costs or negative operating leverage from lower-than-expected revenue could significantly impact profitability and cash flow.
2.  **Competition and Digital Transition:** The children's publishing and media landscape is highly competitive. The ongoing shift to digital consumption requires continuous investment and adaptation, posing a risk to traditional revenue streams like book fairs.
3.  **Debt and Integration Risk:** The recent acquisition of 9 Story Media Group has increased debt levels. Challenges in integrating this new business or a failure to realize expected synergies could strain financial resources.
4.  **Consumer Spending:** As a provider of discretionary goods, Scholastic is susceptible to downturns in consumer spending, which could impact sales in its trade and book fair channels.
