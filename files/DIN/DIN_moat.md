### **1) Network Effects**

**Reasoning:** Dine Brands' business model does not exhibit strong network effects. The value proposition for a new franchisee is primarily driven by the brand's existing reputation and operational support, not by the number of other franchisees. While a larger network of restaurants can increase brand awareness, it does not create a direct network effect where the value of the service increases for existing users as more users join.

**Evidence:**
*   The company's value is derived from its brands (Applebee's, IHOP, Fuzzy's Taco Shop) and the franchise system it has built, not a user-based network. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**

**Reasoning:** Franchisees face moderate switching costs. These include the initial franchise and development fees, as well as the significant capital investment in restaurant construction and equipment. However, the franchise agreements have finite terms, and franchisees can choose not to renew, or to switch to a different brand, albeit with a significant loss of their initial investment.

**Evidence:**
*   The standard domestic Applebee's franchise agreement has an initial term of 20 years, with options for renewal. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)
*   The standard domestic IHOP franchise agreement has an initial term of 20 years, with a renewal option for 10 years. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)
*   The standard Fuzzy's franchise agreement has an initial term of 10 years, with two additional 10-year renewal options. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**

**Reasoning:** Dine Brands has some cost advantages through its centralized supply chain cooperative, CSCS, which serves both Applebee's and IHOP. This provides purchasing power and potential cost savings for franchisees. However, this is a common practice in the franchise restaurant industry, and there is no clear evidence that Dine Brands has a significant and durable cost advantage over its primary competitors.

**Evidence:**
*   Centralized Supply Chain Services, LLC (CSCS), an independent cooperative, serves as the sole authorized purchasing agent for Applebee's and IHOP in the U.S. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)
*   100% of domestic Applebee's and IHOP franchisees are members of CSCS. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**

**Reasoning:** Dine Brands' primary assets are its well-known restaurant brands: Applebee's and IHOP. These brands have strong name recognition and established customer bases. However, the fast-casual and casual dining segments are highly competitive, and brand loyalty can be fickle. The company's Fuzzy's Taco Shop brand is less established on a national level.

**Evidence:**
*   The company owns the trademarks for "Applebee's," "IHOP," and "Fuzzy's Taco Shop," among others. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)
*   IHOP was reported to be the largest restaurant chain in the midscale family-style segment in the U.S. by system-wide sales in 2023. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)
*   Applebee's was reported to be one of the largest restaurant chains in the casual dining segment in the U.S. by system-wide sales in 2023. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**

**Reasoning:** With over 3,500 restaurants, Dine Brands has a significant national and international footprint. This scale provides some advantages in marketing and brand awareness. However, the restaurant industry is characterized by intense competition, and there is little evidence that Dine Brands' scale creates a significant barrier to entry for new competitors.

**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, there were 1,614 Applebee's restaurants, 1,824 IHOP restaurants, and 117 Fuzzy's Taco Shop restaurants. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)
*   Restaurants are located in 49 U.S. states and 19 countries and two U.S. territories. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**

**Reasoning:** While Dine Brands collects sales data from its franchisees and has loyalty programs, there is no evidence of a proprietary dataset that provides a significant competitive advantage. Many of its competitors have similar data-gathering capabilities. The company is investing in technology, but a clear data-driven moat has not yet emerged.

**Evidence:**
*   IHOP launched its first-ever loyalty program, the International Bank of Pancakes, in 2022, with the goal of increasing visit frequency and spend. (Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**

**Reasoning:** Dine Brands does not have a strong ecosystem or platform in the traditional sense. While it has a network of franchisees and a centralized supply chain, there is no evidence of a third-party developer ecosystem or a marketplace of complementary products that would create a powerful platform effect.

**Evidence:**
*   The business model is a traditional franchise system, not a platform-based ecosystem. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**

**Reasoning:** The restaurant industry is subject to various regulations, but these do not create significant barriers to entry that would protect Dine Brands from competition. Franchise laws and regulations apply to all franchisors, and do not provide a unique advantage to Dine Brands.

**Evidence:**
*   The company is subject to FTC regulations and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises, but these are standard for the industry. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**

**Reasoning:** Dine Brands' 99% franchised model is not capital-intensive for the company itself. However, franchisees must make significant, specialized investments in their restaurants, which creates a barrier to exit for them, and a barrier to entry for potential new franchisees. This provides some stability to Dine Brands' revenue stream.

**Evidence:**
*   The company's business model is "highly franchised," which requires less capital investment from the company. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**

**Reasoning:** The long-term franchise agreements provide a degree of revenue visibility. However, royalties are based on a percentage of sales, which can fluctuate with economic conditions and restaurant performance. The company's revenue is not as predictable as a subscription-based software company, for example.

**Evidence:**
*   Franchise agreements for Applebee's and IHOP typically have an initial term of 20 years. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)
*   Royalties are generally a percentage of gross sales, which can fluctuate. (Form 10-K, filed March 5, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **Aggregation**

Weighted score = (1 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 1.76

Final weighted numeric score: 38.0 / 100

### **Mapping**

A weighted score of 38.0 falls into the 30 <= Weighted < 50 range, which maps to a final moat rating of 2.

### **Moat Duration Justification**

The estimated moat duration is approximately 5-7 years. This is based on the strength of the company's brands, which is its primary competitive advantage. However, the restaurant industry is highly competitive and subject to changing consumer tastes, which could erode the brands' value over time. The long-term franchise agreements provide some stability, but the company's moat is not strong enough to be considered durable over a 10-15 year horizon.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**

1.  **A significant shift in consumer preferences away from casual and family dining.** This could be driven by a number of factors, including a move towards healthier eating, a preference for faster, more convenient options, or a decline in disposable income.
2.  **Increased competition from new and existing players.** The restaurant industry has low barriers to entry, and new concepts are constantly emerging. A new, innovative competitor could steal market share from Applebee's and IHOP.
3.  **A decline in the financial health of franchisees.** If franchisees are struggling, they may be unable to invest in remodeling and upkeep, which could lead to a decline in the customer experience and damage the brands' reputations.

### **KPIs to Monitor**

*   **Same-restaurant sales growth:** A key indicator of the health of the company's brands.
*   **Franchisee profitability:** A measure of the financial health of the franchise system.
*   **Net restaurant growth:** An indicator of the attractiveness of the company's franchise offerings.
*   **Customer traffic:** A measure of the number of customers visiting the company's restaurants.
*   **Brand sentiment and awareness:** A measure of the public's perception of the company's brands.
*   **Off-premise sales as a percentage of total sales:** A measure of the company's ability to adapt to the growing demand for delivery and takeout.
*   **Loyalty program membership and engagement:** A measure of customer loyalty and the effectiveness of the company's marketing efforts.
*   **CSCS cost savings:** A measure of the effectiveness of the company's supply chain cooperative.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**

Dine Brands Global, Inc. has a narrow moat based primarily on the strength of its well-established Applebee's and IHOP brands. The company's highly franchised business model is capital-light and provides a degree of revenue visibility through long-term franchise agreements. However, the restaurant industry is intensely competitive and subject to shifting consumer preferences, which limits the durability of the company's competitive advantages. A significant and sustained decline in same-restaurant sales and franchisee profitability would be the most likely evidence to cause a downgrade in the moat rating.

moat rating is 2 / 5
