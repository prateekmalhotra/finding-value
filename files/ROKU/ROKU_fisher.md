### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku operates in the large and growing global TV streaming market. Its primary revenue driver, the Platform segment (advertising, content distribution), grew 18% year-over-year in Q2 2025. The company is positioned to benefit from the ongoing shift of advertising budgets from traditional linear TV to Connected TV (CTV), a market projected to grow significantly. Roku is expanding internationally and now reaches over 50% of U.S. broadband households, indicating a large, monetizable user base.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku consistently invests in its platform and services. In 2025, the company has focused on innovating its Home Screen to expand monetization opportunities, such as the Sports Zone, and deepening programmatic advertising relationships with partners like The Trade Desk. The company launched a new lineup of Roku-branded TVs in 2025, featuring hardware and software enhancements like Mini-LED and a "Smart Picture Max" algorithm, indicating a commitment to both its licensing and first-party hardware strategy. Recent acquisitions like Frndly TV are aimed at expanding content and user value on the platform.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's R&D spending has been substantial, totaling $720 million in 2024. This investment has resulted in Roku maintaining its position as the #1 TV streaming platform in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. The company's key innovation is its purpose-built operating system (Roku OS), which is seen as a primary competitive advantage due to its user-friendly interface and agnosticism. An executive noted in August 2023 that the company spends roughly $1 billion a year on R&D, creating a high barrier to entry for competitors.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The success of Roku's sales efforts is evident in its key performance indicators. The company's high-margin Platform revenue grew 18% YoY in Q2 2025. Roku is expanding its advertising sales capabilities through a strategic partnership with Amazon Ads to enhance ad targeting and inventory. It has successfully licensed its OS to power 40.3% of smart TVs sold in the U.S. in Q1 2025, demonstrating the effectiveness of its partnership and licensing sales team.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku has historically prioritized growth over profitability, leading to negative GAAP operating margins. While the company is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis, it expects to be operating income positive by Q4 2025. The business has two distinct margin profiles: the Devices segment runs at or below break-even (negative mid-teens gross margin expected in Q3 2025), while the Platform segment is highly profitable with gross margins around 51-54%. As the higher-margin Platform segment constitutes a growing majority of revenue, the overall margin profile is improving, but it is not yet consistently positive.
**Answer:** No

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving profitability. Key actions include shifting the business mix towards the high-margin Platform segment and controlling operating expenses. The company has raised its full-year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA guidance to $375 million and expects to achieve positive operating income in Q4 2025, ahead of previous schedules. Furthermore, the CFO stated they expect "further margin improvement in 2026" by balancing investment in growth with operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Public information on labor relations is centered on corporate culture statements. Roku states it aims to hire talented, independent thinkers and be a great place to work, focusing on impact over lavish perks. The company provides benefits including healthcare, retirement options, and mental health support. For salaried employees, the company has an unlimited vacation policy, built on trust and responsibility. While there is no evidence of poor labor relations, there is also a lack of specific, verifiable metrics (like attrition rates or employee engagement scores) in the public domain to definitively call them "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku is led by its founder, Anthony Wood, who has served as Chairman and CEO since 2002, providing long-term stability and a consistent vision. The company's 2024 10-K filing lists a stable team of executive officers, many with significant tenure at the company or in the industry. There is no public evidence of significant executive infighting or instability. The company's consistent strategy and execution under this long-tenured leadership team suggests stable and effective executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm (February 15, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond founder and CEO Anthony Wood, Roku has a publicly listed executive team with defined roles covering key areas like finance, platform business, and devices. For instance, Dan Jedda is the CFO, and Mustafa Ozgen leads the Devices business. The company's ability to simultaneously execute a complex hardware licensing business, a direct-to-consumer hardware line, and a rapidly growing advertising platform suggests significant management depth below the C-suite. However, like many founder-led companies, there is a key-person risk associated with the CEO, and succession plans are not publicly detailed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm (February 15, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's financial filings are audited by a reputable firm (PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP), which provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company provides segment reporting for its Platform and Devices businesses, offering investors clear insight into revenue and gross profit drivers. There is no recent history of financial restatements or disclosed material weaknesses in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm (February 15, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's key competitive advantage is its purpose-built, platform-agnostic operating system (Roku OS). Unlike competitors such as Amazon, Apple, and Google, Roku does not prioritize its own content, making it a neutral partner for streaming services and TV manufacturers. This neutrality has created a powerful network effect, establishing Roku OS as the leading smart TV OS in the U.S. with over 50% market penetration. This scale is a significant moat, attracting more users, content partners, and advertisers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHPmuYjz2jPABKeOuZRbRZ0KpipdSdqIRRBK3gSqaIrlUuj7UQTRwmyPhLE2Z_MrQMMQpLrqUWoh7QuraHTZNauj1t51e22B57fy5j1_N38Vxf0tPa2vyDRHFkRyrUwwS75Ek_CGen-sT8l8DO4VY2WnthN5OFbmm6EXupWA4W7EAjy-9G5wYCbUz7f3LmMcQ== (July 19, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGqOQ13WiZHLNTT_fLXO5TKV6WPNz_cOK-wRrxTVietKE6bQbHyx7CfZWv2i14nTWKlDlXKzIlhE8H6BW-t99sh0yQA4T_CH1YwLfFe_4toxQ3xj9Ali-pRhi0QaUW1F6ihNx3ounw06qkjaapcihfsigRkQ4JvAuI-0-H2gQtqHnaepao4v_8JEMvd2-ers_pjiEvUgW0lzZu2F956Sbjy_ALnfiG-sm8R_9VpscmZdQFWqPSlR4_dLB818iQ= (August 15, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku has consistently prioritized investing for long-term growth over short-term profitability. This is demonstrated by its significant R&D spend and strategy of selling hardware devices at low or negative margins to acquire users for its high-margin Platform business. While management is now guiding towards profitability, the historical record and recent earnings call commentary confirm a focus on sustaining double-digit platform revenue growth while gradually improving margins, indicating a balanced but still long-term-oriented view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHPmuYjz2jPABKeOuZRbRZ0KpipdSdqIRRBK3gSqaIrlUuj7UQTRwmyPhLE2Z_MrQMMQpLrqUWoh7QuraHTZNauj1t51e22B57fy5j1_N38Vxf0tPa2vyDRHFkRyrUwwS75Ek_CGen-sT8l8DO4VY2WnthN5OFbmm6EXupWA4W7EAjy-9G5wYCbUz7f3LmMcQ== (July 19, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH_Rw2pm04WeWE0NnF-_0OnLt5H_d-T6i1uDyMyvB5QjuPg4BBqxtBFM7OSfTJMRDVMSGpS9XSkTNCyZO0zXfZjEkyrmGOsJBxKxzPB-PfRGYdtz57Xb0cCLChQ-tgKgGcgFvABh8fG6VhLZkQFtvacA4E6Amaezdujh1XUX8N_XRrBynkf_DwByrdB7CFFZDlLG5mv (August 1, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku maintains a strong balance sheet. As of June 30, 2025, the company's liquid assets exceeded its short-term obligations, and it held more cash than debt. The company has achieved positive Adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow for several consecutive quarters. Reinforcing its financial strength, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $400 million in July 2025, signaling that management believes the company is sufficiently capitalized and that its shares are not overvalued.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's management team, particularly CEO Anthony Wood, regularly communicates its strategy and results through quarterly shareholder letters and earnings calls. In these communications, the company discusses both successes, like platform revenue growth, and challenges, such as the negative-margin profile of the Devices segment and the competitive landscape. The company provides detailed outlooks and key metrics, demonstrating a consistent level of transparency with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant legal or regulatory issues, scandals, or governance red flags concerning Roku's senior management. The company's proxy statement and 10-K filings do not reveal any problematic related-party transactions or a history of audit issues. The company is led by its long-term founder, and the overall public record suggests a management team focused on execution and competition, with no major integrity issues to note.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm (February 15, 2025)]

---
Synthesis:
Roku scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its strong market position, long-term growth strategy, and stable management. The company's primary strengths are its dominant, platform-agnostic operating system which creates a powerful network effect, and its clear runway for growth as the TV advertising market continues its secular shift to streaming. The main weaknesses identified are its current lack of GAAP profitability and the absence of verifiable data to confirm "outstanding" employee relations. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on management's ability to deliver on its promise of sustained profitability. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on "Worthwhile Profit Margins" would require several consecutive quarters of positive GAAP operating income. Conversely, a major competitive setback, such as a large TV OEM partner like TCL or Hisense dropping Roku's OS, could threaten the "Long Runway" and "Competitive Clues" theses.

fisher score is 13 / 15
