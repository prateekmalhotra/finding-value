Of course. Here is a revised and corrected version of the valuation for Badger Meter, Inc. (BMI).

The original valuation was well-structured, but it contained a significant flaw in the terminal value calculation. While the conservative assumptions in the explicit forecast period were reasonable, the Gordon Growth method produced an implied exit multiple (9.4x EV/EBITDA) that was drastically inconsistent with the company's quality, market position, and historical trading range (TTM ~26x). This level of multiple compression implies a catastrophic change in the business's long-term prospects, which is overly pessimistic for a base-case scenario.

My revised valuation corrects this by using a more realistic Exit Multiple approach for the terminal value, which better reflects the company's status as a high-quality, technology-driven industrial leader, even after its high-growth phase moderates. Other assumptions have been slightly refined to reflect a balanced, "just right" perspective.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability expectations embedded in the current stock price.

**A) Current Market Price & Baseline Financials**

*   **Current Market Price:** $189.29 (at close, August 22, 2025).

**Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months ending June 30, 2025)**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $873.93 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 41.18% | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $174.17 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| *Operating Margin* | *19.93%* | *(Calculation)* |
| Net Income | $135.74 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $33.16 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $7.31 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures | $14.71 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | $9.77 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | $0.00 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $165.21 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $0.00 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 29.57 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |

**B) Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current enterprise value of **$5,433.4 million**, derived from the market price, an iterative Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model was used. The model solves for the required growth rate to match the market price, holding profitability steady.

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 16.5%**

This is the average annual revenue growth rate required over the next five years to justify the current stock price, assuming the TTM operating margin of 19.9% is sustained.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To invest in BMI at its current price, one must believe the company can grow its revenues by approximately 16.5% annually for the next five years while maintaining its historically high operating margins.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on balanced, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) Forecast & Assumptions with Rationale**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **12% tapering to 6%** | The market implies 16.5% growth. While BMI's 3-year historical average is high (17.9%), the most recent TTM growth was 11.82% (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025). A realistic forecast starts near this recent trend, driven by AMI adoption and infrastructure needs, and tapers down as the company matures and the market becomes more saturated. |
| **Operating Margin** | **19.5%** | The TTM margin is a high 19.9%, while the 3-year average is 17.1% (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025). Margins have structurally improved due to pricing power and a richer mix of high-margin software and technology sales. A stable 19.5% acknowledges these gains while building in a slight moderation from the absolute peak. |
| **Tax Rate** | **25.0%** | In line with the TTM effective tax rate of 25.26% and the 3-year average of ~24.4% (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025). |
| **Capex % of Revenue** | **1.5%** | Based on the 3-year historical average of approximately 1.4% of revenue (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025). This reflects the capital-light nature of its recent growth. |
| **ΔWC % of ΔRevenue** | **10.0%** | Based on the most recent TTM calculation of ~10.5% (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025), acknowledging historical volatility but using a recent, stable figure. |
| **SBC % of Revenue** | **0.8%** | Consistent with the TTM level of 0.84% of revenue (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025). |
| **Share Count Change** | **+0.3% annually** | Reflects historical average dilution from stock-based compensation with no major announced buyback programs (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025). |

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 12.0% | 10.0% | 8.0% | 7.0% | 6.0% |
| **Revenue** | **$978.8** | **$1,076.7** | **$1,162.8** | **$1,244.2** | **$1,318.9**|
| EBIT (19.5% Margin) | $190.9 | $210.0 | $226.7 | $242.6 | $257.2 |
| Tax on EBIT | ($47.7) | ($52.5) | ($56.7) | ($60.7) | ($64.3) |
| **NOPAT** | **$143.1** | **$157.5** | **$170.1** | **$182.0** | **$192.9** |
| D&A | $37.1 | $40.9 | $44.2 | $47.3 | $50.1 |
| SBC | ($7.8) | ($8.6) | ($9.3) | ($10.0) | ($10.6) |
| Capex | ($14.7) | ($16.1) | ($17.4) | ($18.7) | ($19.8) |
| Change in WC | ($10.5) | ($9.8) | ($8.6) | ($8.1) | ($7.5) |
| **FCFF** | **$147.3** | **$163.8** | **$178.9** | **$192.5** | **$205.1** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard assumption for a mature market).
    *   Beta (β): **1.10** (Assumed, reflecting the company's industrial nature and above-average growth profile).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.10 * 5.0% = 9.76%**
*   **Cost of Debt:** Not applicable as the company has no debt.
*   **WACC = Cost of Equity = 9.76%**

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Exit Multiple Method:** The Gordon Growth method previously implied a 9.4x EV/EBITDA multiple, which is unrealistically low for a high-quality, debt-free market leader. Instead, an Exit Multiple approach is more appropriate. A terminal multiple of **16.0x EV/EBITDA** is used. This represents a significant, but realistic, moderation from the current TTM multiple (~26x) to a level befitting a more mature, yet still high-quality, industrial technology company.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $257.2M + $50.1M = $307.3M.
    *   **Terminal Value** = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $307.3M * 16.0 = **$4,916.8 million**.
*   **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   This terminal value implies a perpetual growth rate (`g`).
    *   Implied `g` = WACC - (FCFF_yr6 / Terminal Value) = 9.76% - ($205.1 * (1.035) / $4,916.8M) = 9.76% - 4.31% = **5.45%**.
    *   An implied growth rate of 5.45% is high for a perpetuity. This indicates that the combination of our WACC and Exit Multiple is still quite optimistic. To balance this, we will use a blended average of the Exit Multiple result and the original conservative Gordon Growth result.
    *   **Blended Terminal Value = (TV_Exit Multiple + TV_Gordon Growth) / 2 = ($4,916.8M + $2,820.2M) / 2 = $3,868.5 million.** This blended approach tempers the optimism of the exit multiple with the conservatism of the perpetuity growth method, providing a more balanced view.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Calculation Step | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) | $722.9 |
| PV of Blended Terminal Value | $2,429.3 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$3,152.2** |
| Less: Net Debt (Total Debt - Cash) | ($165.2) |
| **Equity Value** | **$3,317.4** |

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Shares:** The initial 29.57M shares are projected to grow by 0.3% annually for 5 years, reaching **30.01M** shares.
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Projected Shares = $3,317.4M / 30.01M = $110.54**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $110.54**. Assumes 12% revenue growth tapering to 6% with 19.5% operating margins and a blended terminal value.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$80**. Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 8% tapering to 4%) and margin compression to 17% due to competition.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$145**. Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 15% tapering to 7%), margin expansion to 21%, and a higher exit multiple (e.g., 18x).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $110.54 * (1 - 0.30) = $77.38**

**Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include: 1) **High Valuation:** Even with a more conservative valuation, the current market price implies very high and sustained growth, making it vulnerable to any execution missteps. 2) **Cyclicality:** A significant portion of revenue is tied to municipal and industrial spending, which can be cyclical and subject to budget constraints. 3) **Competition:** The smart water solutions market is competitive; failure to innovate could lead to margin pressure. 4) **Input Costs:** Fluctuations in raw material and electronic component costs could impact profitability.

final answer is 110.54 $
