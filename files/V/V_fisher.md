**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa continues to benefit from the global shift to digital payments and the growth of e-commerce. The company's core business is driven by payments volume, which grew 5% in the three months ended March 31, 2025, on a nominal basis, demonstrating resilient consumer spending. Visa is also expanding its "new flows" through value-added services, which saw revenue growth of 28% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, indicating a strong growth trajectory beyond traditional card payments. The large and growing total addressable market for digital payments, especially in emerging economies, provides a long runway for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's acquisition of Featurespace Limited in December 2024 for $946 million highlights its commitment to investing in new technologies like AI-powered fraud prevention. The consistent growth in value-added services revenue, reaching $2.8 billion for the three months ended June 30, 2025, is a direct result of ongoing product development in areas like issuing and acceptance solutions. Visa’s management consistently emphasizes its focus on innovation and expanding its network capabilities in earnings calls.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the 10-Q does not explicitly break out R&D spending, the company's "Network and processing" expenses, which include technology investments, were $655 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, a 15% increase from the prior year, indicating continued investment in their network. The successful growth of value-added services and the acquisition of technology companies like Featurespace are tangible outputs of their development efforts. However, without a clear R&D to revenue ratio, a direct comparison to peers is difficult, but the outcomes suggest effectiveness.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's consistent revenue growth, with a 14% increase in net revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2025, points to a highly effective sales and client management organization. The company's ability to renew and expand relationships with major financial institutions and merchants globally is a key driver of its success. Client incentives, a proxy for the cost of securing and retaining business, grew by 13% for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, in line with revenue growth, suggesting a disciplined approach to sales.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa demonstrates exceptional profitability. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, operating income was $6.2 billion on net revenues of $10.2 billion, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 61%. This high margin is a core feature of Visa's business model, which benefits from significant operating leverage as transaction volumes grow.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa is focused on growing its higher-margin value-added services, which contribute to maintaining its strong profitability. The company also demonstrates operating discipline, with non-GAAP operating expenses growing slower than net revenues in the nine months ended June 30, 2025 (10% vs 11%). While a significant litigation provision impacted GAAP operating expenses in the most recent quarter, the underlying business operations continue to show strong margin performance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no indications of significant labor disputes or issues in the latest 10-Q. Personnel expenses increased by 11% for the three months ended June 30, 2025, reflecting investments in talent. Without more specific disclosures on employee turnover or satisfaction, it's challenging to definitively assess this point. However, the absence of negative disclosures suggests stable relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The management team appears stable, with key executives having been with the company for several years. The 10-Q discloses that the CEO and General Counsel adopted Rule 10b5-1 trading plans in May 2025, which is a routine practice for executives and suggests a planned and orderly approach to managing their stock holdings. There is no evidence of significant executive turnover or internal conflicts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa’s quarterly earnings calls and investor presentations feature a range of executives beyond the CEO and CFO, indicating a deep bench of leadership. The company is structured with leaders for various geographic regions and business units, suggesting a decentralized and empowered management structure. The detailed and confident responses from various leaders during Q&A sessions in earnings calls demonstrate a strong grasp of the business.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the company maintains that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective. The 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, states that there have been no changes in internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the company's internal control over financial reporting. This suggests a high level of confidence in their accounting and control systems.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa’s primary competitive advantage is its network effect. With billions of cards in circulation and acceptance at millions of merchant locations, the value of the network increases for all participants with each new user. This creates a formidable barrier to entry. The company’s brand is also a major asset, synonymous with trust and reliability in payments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Not applicable.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's consistent investments in technology, including acquisitions like Featurespace, demonstrate a focus on long-term growth and security of its network. Management’s commentary in earnings calls frequently emphasizes long-term growth drivers such as new flows and value-added services, rather than focusing solely on short-term results. The authorization of a new $30.0 billion share repurchase program in April 2025 also signals confidence in the long-term cash generation of the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations, with $16.8 billion in the nine months ended June 30, 2025. The company has a robust share repurchase program, buying back $13.2 billion of stock in the same period, which is anti-dilutive. Visa’s ability to fund acquisitions and investments from cash flow and debt issuance, such as the €3.5 billion senior notes issued in May 2025, indicates no need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's management team regularly hosts earnings calls and participates in investor conferences, providing detailed updates on the business. The 10-Q provides a thorough overview of legal proceedings, including ongoing litigation and regulatory matters, demonstrating transparency. While management is generally optimistic, they do address challenges and headwinds when they arise.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa is involved in several legal proceedings, as disclosed in its 10-Q, including antitrust litigation. While litigation is common for a company of Visa's size and market position, the ongoing nature of these disputes raises questions. The "Litigation provision" of $1.66 billion for the nine months ended June 30, 2025, is substantial. Due to the ongoing nature of these legal challenges, it is difficult to give an unequivocal "Yes" to this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (July 29, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Visa scores highly on most of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting its dominant market position, strong profitability, and consistent growth. The company's key strengths lie in its powerful network effect, which creates a long runway for growth, and its exceptional profit margins. The primary area of concern is the ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny, which prevents a perfect score on integrity. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the outcome of major litigation, which could either remove the current overhang or result in significant penalties. Additionally, a sustained slowdown in consumer spending or increased competition from emerging payment technologies could also impact future growth and profitability. A resolution of the major antitrust litigation in Visa’s favor would be the most likely event to flip the "No" to a "Yes".

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
