CVS Health Corporation, August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K filed February 5, 2025; Q1 2025 Earnings Call held May 1, 2025; Q2 2025 Earnings Call held August 6, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health operates in the vast and growing U.S. healthcare sector. The company's integrated model, spanning pharmacy benefits, retail, and health insurance, serves over 36 million people. Key growth drivers include an aging U.S. population, which increases demand for Medicare Advantage and prescription drugs, and the expansion of value-based care models through its acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health. The Health Care Benefits segment, a standout performer, grew revenues by 23.7% in 2024, driven by growth in Medicare and individual exchange products. Management noted in its Q2 2025 earnings call that the Health Care Benefits segment delivered a significant upside, laying a solid foundation for future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health has demonstrated a strong commitment to evolving its business model beyond retail pharmacy into integrated healthcare delivery. The acquisitions of Signify Health (a leader in in-home health evaluations) and Oak Street Health (a value-based primary care provider for seniors) in 2023 for a combined total of over $17 billion are primary evidence of this strategy. The company also launched Cordavis™, a wholly-owned subsidiary, to commercialize and co-produce biosimilar products, aiming to increase competition and lower drug costs. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, executives highlighted the strong performance of the Health Care Benefits (HCB) segment as a foundation for future growth and a sign that their operational strategies are yielding positive results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==) (August 18, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health does not disclose a specific figure for Research & Development (R&D) expenditures in its financial statements, which is common for companies in its industry. Instead, innovation is reflected through investments in technology, digital initiatives, and acquisitions. The company's 2024 10-K mentions making "concerted investments in emerging technology capabilities such as artificial intelligence ('AI') to further automate, augment and improve its operational capabilities." The effectiveness of these efforts is demonstrated through the expansion of its digital footprint and the integration of new healthcare delivery assets like Signify Health and Oak Street Health, rather than traditional R&D metrics like patents.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's sales efforts are multifaceted, leveraging a national presence and multiple channels. In the Health Care Benefits segment, it uses its own sales personnel, independent brokers, and both public and private health insurance exchanges to reach customers. The Health Services segment's success is demonstrated by its ability to manage prescription drug services for approximately 90 million plan members. In the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, the ExtraCare loyalty program is a key sales tool, recognized as one of the largest and most successful retail loyalty programs in the U.S. This extensive reach and multi-channel approach indicate a highly effective, above-average sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, CVS Health's consolidated operating margin was 2.3% (Operating Income of $8.5 billion on Total Revenues of $372.8 billion). This margin is thin, reflecting the low-margin nature of its largest segments, pharmacy benefit management and drug distribution. While the Health Services and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments posted adjusted operating margins of 4.2% and 4.6% respectively, the Health Care Benefits segment's adjusted operating margin was only 0.2% due to elevated medical costs. While the company generates significant absolute profit, its consolidated margin is not indicative of a high-margin business.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to improve profitability. In Q3 2024, the company initiated an enterprise-wide restructuring plan to streamline the organization and reduce costs, with expected savings of over $500 million in 2025. Specific actions include the planned closure of 271 retail stores in 2025 and the discontinuation of certain non-core assets. Furthermore, the company is focused on improving its Medicare Advantage margins, with management expressing confidence in their 2025 cost-trend assumptions ahead of 2026 bids. The launch of Cordavis to market lower-cost biosimilars is another strategic move aimed at improving purchasing economics and margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==) (August 18, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, CVS Health employed over 300,000 people. The company states it strives to offer a comprehensive and competitive mix of pay and benefits. It conducts annual engagement surveys, with over 150,000 colleagues participating in each of the two surveys in 2024, and reports that overall engagement remained consistent. However, like many large retail and healthcare employers, the company faces ongoing labor pressures inherent in the industry. While the company has established programs and touts a culture of respect, there is no verifiable, external evidence to suggest its labor relations are "outstanding" relative to peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant leadership changes. The 2024 10-K lists a new CEO, President, and CFO all appointed in late 2024 or early 2025. For example, Thomas F. Cowhey became CFO in January 2024, J. David Joyner became CEO in October 2024, and Steven H. Nelson became President of Aetna in November 2024. While executive turnover can be a part of strategic realignment, such a high degree of change at the most senior levels in a short period suggests a period of transition rather than stable, outstanding long-term executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's 2024 10-K lists ten executive officers, including heads of its major segments (Aetna, Pharmacy Services), as well as leaders for key functions like technology, human resources, and legal. The company has distinct leadership for its Health Care Benefits, Health Services, and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments, indicating a formal management structure with clear lines of responsibility. The recent appointments to CEO and CFO were internal or from recently acquired companies, suggesting a bench of talent. However, the high number of recent changes at the top level makes it difficult to assess the long-term depth and stability of the current team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health is a large accelerated filer with the SEC and has been subject to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The 2024 10-K includes a report from management attesting to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The company's independent registered public accounting firm has also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down revenues and operating costs, which demonstrates a granular level of cost analysis. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or recent restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's key competitive advantage is its vertically integrated model, which combines a national retail pharmacy footprint, a major pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), and a large health insurer (Aetna). This integration allows the company to engage with consumers across multiple points of the healthcare journey, from providing insurance to managing prescriptions to delivering care. The recent acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health deepen this integration into in-home evaluations and primary care, creating a more holistic and potentially lower-cost ecosystem. This strategy of connecting disparate parts of the healthcare system is a primary differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent major acquisitions of Aetna, Signify Health, and Oak Street Health, totaling tens of billions of dollars, are strong evidence of a long-range profit outlook. These moves fundamentally reshape the company toward a future of integrated, value-based healthcare, which requires significant upfront investment and integration costs that can pressure short-term results. Management has accepted near-term margin pressure, particularly in the Health Care Benefits segment, while executing this strategy. The company’s enterprise-wide restructuring plan and focus on Medicare Advantage margin recovery also reflect a commitment to long-term profitability over short-term gains.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==) (August 18, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health generates substantial cash flow from operations, reporting $9.1 billion in 2024. Major acquisitions like Signify Health and Oak Street Health were funded through a combination of cash and significant debt issuance, not equity. The company has a history of using debt for large transactions and then paying it down with operating cash flow. While the company maintains share repurchase programs, these are funded by cash on hand and are anti-dilutive. Given the strong cash flow generation and access to debt markets, it is unlikely the company would need to resort to dilutive equity financing for foreseeable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its quarterly earnings calls, management openly discusses challenges. For instance, in 2024, executives detailed the pressures on the Health Care Benefits segment, including elevated Medicare utilization and the negative impact of lower star ratings on its Medicare Advantage plans. Analyst reports from August 2025 confirm that management has been forthcoming about these issues and has expressed confidence in their cost-trend assumptions for 2025, providing a level of comfort to investors regarding their handling of the challenges. This transparency about both positive (HCB segment upside) and negative (MA margin pressure) developments indicates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1tD3BsQw5mVQcIxf7fA6A5HeI1MjHi0thj6ZhsQmJDs8Zvy0e75iXG8yggGhLkeayXbPQgBMyvDfgIwGdt2BPFLv5LeV7DdYxvzderhVmcbMd5OhvG_pacMku06wTVDnG0xpb6_XPvLe67BRisLDUcR-qj0SQrSB62qw4qENliCzNm2Gq6rxRSEaiqFdgNCI0wo4Ep6aRUnefbRby3lE-Y4DTIojyAm53XIlx2bwDz57lj6hUEn9Ax6FfCyMH5w==) (August 18, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has faced significant legal and regulatory challenges. The 2024 10-K discloses ongoing litigation related to opioid distribution, for which it has recorded significant charges. It also mentions a "Settlement Framework" and a "Federal Court In Ohio Judgment" related to these matters. In August 2025, it was reported that the Caremark unit was ordered to pay nearly $290 million in a Medicare fraud case. While legal challenges are common for a company of this size and scope, the nature and scale of these issues, particularly those related to the opioid crisis and Medicare fraud, prevent a characterization of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
CVS Health scores well on its long-term strategy and the foundational elements of its business, such as its sales organization, financial controls, and competitive positioning through vertical integration. The company is clearly making long-range investments in the future of healthcare delivery, willingly sacrificing short-term profits for a more durable, integrated growth model. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses in current profitability, executive stability, and legal/integrity issues. The low profit margins, particularly in the critical Health Care Benefits segment, are a major concern, as is the recent high turnover in the C-suite. The most significant variables likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the margin improvement plan for Medicare Advantage and the stabilization of the executive team. A "No" on profit margins could flip to "Yes" if the company successfully improves its Medical Benefit Ratio in the HCB segment and demonstrates sustained margin expansion from its cost-cutting programs. Similarly, a "No" on executive relations would flip to "Yes" with a period of stability and demonstrated success from the new leadership team.

fisher score is 9 / 15
