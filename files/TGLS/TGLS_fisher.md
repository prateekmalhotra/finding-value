### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size

**Reasoning & Evidence:** I am unable to find specific R&D expenditure figures as a percentage of revenue or detailed metrics on the output of their R&D efforts in the provided search results or the company's filings. While the company mentions product innovation as a strategic initiative, there is no concrete data to evaluate the effectiveness of its R&D relative to its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass has a strong market presence in the United States, Latin America, and the Caribbean, exporting to over 27 countries.

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Tecnoglass has a trailing twelve-month gross margin of 44.74%, an operating margin of 26.27%, and a net margin of 19.13%. These margins are strong for a manufacturing company and indicate efficient operations and good pricing power. For the trailing twelve months, the company's return on equity was 27.89%, and its return on assets was 14.78%.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEELdFJE96-8ebD664TsRhTULQYcPLfIAqNiSbI7lhTUojQilJgS47ii21JK4fWpmAmxwuwnu2gZlI8lComQJ9zoPqCp-6c2nMO19HdCjOyp--UokTbmyhERj7jgIewrkZPEGkb8gM=']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I am unable to find specific, recent details on actions being taken to improve profit margins from the provided search results. While their current margins are healthy, Fisher's point requires evidence of ongoing actions.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a large workforce, with 9,837 employees. However, I am unable to find specific information regarding employee turnover, engagement scores, union relations, or safety metrics from the provided search results or recent filings to definitively assess the quality of its labor and personnel relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGeefINny6qiw3nDPtTKYoRGj0koEx_st6vfNv3dmRj_thrvzD6gE-A4XWSFf0wmtJYOxs22TRQX73SnxA0d4BXXzoZMeRyMRGbLJph2lmmwFtj2MqgRsxRFjmM5ggu3gvUTUG5AOKhKVWg']

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company was founded in 1983 by José Manuel Daes and Christian Daes, who appear to still be involved with the company, suggesting a degree of stability at the top. However, without more detailed information on the broader executive team's tenure, succession planning, and incentive alignment from a proxy statement or similar document, it is difficult to definitively assess the state of executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHTKGWHcO8wDhlBQ5xS60Mj__dcuvT_PXbAaRF1DjsN8i0ZxsdQGyK6NOfhdoLFZ3Xf2GzoKQn0d_O-u9nr_yL8Q_xWv2Rox5Zwld-6toqDBK07xADja1Naduj8oVFgl3IpYPKv-D7YErsH0N2r1SVLIXMPf3HKHYsZH_pVsXg=']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I am unable to find a detailed list of the executive team beyond the founders or information on the management structure by segment or region. This prevents an assessment of the depth of the management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has one operating and reporting segment, Architectural Glass and Windows, which limits the granularity of its cost analysis from an external perspective. I have not found any evidence of recent restatements or concerns raised by auditors regarding internal controls in the provided search results. However, without a more in-depth review of their audit reports, a definitive conclusion cannot be reached.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGeefINny6qiw3nDPtTKYoRGj0koEx_st6vfNv3dmRj_thrvzD6gE-A4XWSFf0wmtJYOxs22TRQX73SnxA0d4BXXzoZMeRyMRGbLJph2lmmwFtj2MqgRsxRFjmM5ggu3gvUTUG5AOKhKVWg']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass's vertical integration is a key competitive advantage, allowing it to control more of its supply chain. The company's focus on specialized, high-performance products like hurricane-resistant and energy-efficient glass for high-growth markets gives it an edge. Its strategic location in Barranquilla, Colombia provides logistical advantages for serving both North and South American markets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's history of strategic investments, such as the 2017 inauguration of a new soft coat glass line and the 2016 acquisition of GM&P, suggests a focus on long-term growth. The company's stated strategic goals of geographic expansion and product innovation also point to a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHTKGWHcO8wDhlBQ5xS60Mj__dcuvT_PXbAaRF1DjsN8i0ZxsdQGyK6NOfhdoLFZ3Xf2GzoKQn0d_O-u9nr_yL8Q_xWv2Rox5Zwld-6toqDBK07xADja1Naduj8oVFgl3IpYPKv-D7YErsH0N2r1SVLIXMPf3HKHYsZH_pVsXg=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEHerlyrdC_mZ1LBPNCIaaI1_BmQZYK_k2tV_6emY0s2-3xtj-dA3pcFbwVxSbqGEoLhlysoxzV455h8JgfEvpDuN-j4BDanJxiQpdxgWldzV_EiXrV3vL0nQm-piMAl2FX2iRV']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Tecnoglass had total cash of $143.46 million and total debt of $130.32 million, with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 17.71%. The company's current ratio of 2.00 indicates a strong liquidity position. Given its profitability and strong balance sheet, Tecnoglass appears well-positioned to fund its growth without significant equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEELdFJE96-8ebD664TsRhTULQYcPLfIAqNiSbI7lhTUojQilJgS47ii21JK4fWpmAmxwuwnu2gZlI8lComQJ9zoPqCp-6c2nMO19HdCjOyp--UokTbmyhERj7jgIewrkZPEGkb8gM=']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I am unable to assess the company's communication patterns during times of trouble from the provided search results. A review of earnings call transcripts during a challenging period would be necessary to evaluate this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I am unable to find any information regarding legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags from the provided search results. However, a thorough assessment would require a more in-depth review of the company's filings and news history for any such issues.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

Synthesis:
Tecnoglass scores well on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its product runway, commitment to development, strong profit margins, and solid financial position. The company's vertical integration and focus on high-growth markets and products are significant competitive advantages. The score could be improved over the next 12-24 months with greater transparency and more detailed disclosures regarding R&D effectiveness, margin improvement initiatives, and management depth. Several "No" answers could be flipped to "Yes" with more granular data on R&D spending and outcomes, specific margin improvement plans, and more information on the management team beyond the founders. Additionally, a track record of candid communication during any future challenging periods would be needed to satisfy that criterion.

fisher score is 7 / 15
