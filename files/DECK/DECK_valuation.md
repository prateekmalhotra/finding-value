### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5 Years)**

Given the lack of formal guidance, the forecast is based on historical performance and management's qualitative commentary.

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | 12.0% | Based on the 3-year revenue CAGR of approximately 18% (FY2022-2025), adjusted down for conservatism due to macroeconomic uncertainty. This reflects continued strength in the HOKA brand. |
| **Operating Margin** | 22.0% | Slightly below the TTM margin of 23.7% but in line with the average of the last 3 fiscal years (approx. 21.8%) to reflect potential tariff and promotional pressures. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 22.5% | Consistent with the TTM effective tax rate. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 1.8% | Based on the 3-year historical average (FY2023-2025 Capex / FY2023-2025 Revenue). |
| **Change in WC as % of Δ Rev** | 10.0% | Reflects historical relationship between working capital changes and incremental revenue. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Δ in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | 10-Year US Treasury Yield (YCharts, Aug 21, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard market assumption for a mature market. |
| Beta | 0.99 | Reflects market volatility similar to the average. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025). |
| *Cost of Equity* | *9.24%* | *Rf + Beta \* (ERP) = 4.29% + 0.99 \* 5.00%* |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| *Cost of Debt (pre-tax)* | 0.70% | Interest Expense / Total Debt = $2.2M / $312.1M. Low due to minimal debt. |
| **WACC Calculation** | | |
| Market Cap (E) | $15,430 M | (Companies Market Cap, Aug 21, 2025). |
| Total Debt (D) | $312 M | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Enterprise Value (V) | $15,742 M | E + D |
| Weight of Equity (E/V) | 98.0% | |
| Weight of Debt (D/V) | 2.0% | |
| **WACC** | **9.07%** | *(E/V \* Ke) + (D/V \* Kd \* (1-T)) = (0.98\*9.24%) + (0.02\*0.70%\*(1-0.225))* |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Inputs | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method** | Terminal FCFF (Y6): $1,346 M<br>WACC: 9.07%<br>Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% | TV = [FCFF(6) / (WACC - g)] = [$1,346 / (9.07% - 2.5%)] = **$20,487 M** |
| *Justification for g:* 2.5% is chosen as a conservative long-term growth rate, in line with expected long-run inflation and global economic growth. | | |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| Year 5 EBITDA: $2,057 M (EBIT+D&A)<br>Median EV/EBITDA Multiple: ~10x | TV = 10 * $2,057 = **$20,570 M** |
| *Conclusion:* The Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple methods yield very similar results. The Gordon Growth value will be used. | | |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Brand Concentration:** The company relies heavily on the continued popularity of its two main brands, UGG and HOKA. Shifts in consumer fashion trends pose a significant risk to revenue stability.
2.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As cited by management, uncertainty in global trade policy (tariffs) and a potential slowdown in consumer discretionary spending could pressure revenue and margins.
3.  **Competitive Landscape:** The footwear market is intensely competitive. Increased promotional activity from competitors could force Deckers to lower prices, impacting profitability.
4.  **Supply Chain Disruption:** Like many global apparel companies, Deckers is exposed to risks related to manufacturing, sourcing, and logistics, primarily in Asia.
5.  **Inventory Management:** A failure to anticipate demand correctly could lead to excess inventory and markdowns, or missed sales opportunities, both of which would negatively impact financial results.
