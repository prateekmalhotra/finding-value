*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). This can make the stock appear more attractive to investors and provide a floor for the share price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing through 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** €1 billion in additional buybacks in the remainder of 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** €1.5 - €2 billion in additional buybacks in the remainder of 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** >€2 billion in additional buybacks in the remainder of 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (~0-10%). While a positive factor, the impact is likely to be less significant than the fundamental drivers of the business.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a clear track record and has communicated its intention to continue the program.

*   **Mechanism:** This rapid, high-margin growth contributes significantly to profitability and cash flow. It also demonstrates the "stickiness" of ASML's business model, as customers are locked into long-term service and upgrade cycles. This recurring revenue stream can justify a higher valuation multiple.
*   **Timing:** Throughout 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 18-20% growth in Installed Base Management sales in 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 20-22% growth in Installed Base Management sales in 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** >22% growth in Installed Base Management sales in 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (~10-30%). This is a significant and underappreciated driver of ASML's profitability and valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. This is based on direct guidance from the company's management.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** High utilization rates of ASML's machines at customer sites. Continued demand for performance upgrades.
