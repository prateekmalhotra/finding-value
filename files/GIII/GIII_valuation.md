Of course. This is a solid attempt at a valuation, but there are several critical flaws and overly optimistic assumptions that need to be addressed to make it more realistic. The most significant issue is the failure to properly model the financial impact of losing the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses.

Here is a revised and corrected valuation that incorporates more realistic assumptions, particularly regarding revenue and terminal value.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF) - Revised**

**A) Baseline & Market Price**

*   **Current Market Price:** $30.15 (as of market close, May 24, 2024)
*   **Currency:** All figures are in United States Dollars (USD).

**Baseline Financials (TTM as of April 30, 2024)**

| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 44.5 | Q1 FY25 Report, May 2024 |

**B) Reverse-Engineered Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of $30.15, the market appears to be pricing in the following assumptions:

*   **5-Year Revenue Trajectory:** A period of significant revenue decline as the CK/TH licenses wind down, followed by a recovery and moderate growth from the owned-brand portfolio (DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld, etc.) and new licenses (Nautica).
*   **Operating Margin:** A temporary compression of margins during the transition, stabilizing around 8.0%-8.5% long-term.

This implies the market is aware of the upcoming challenges but believes the company can successfully navigate the transition and stabilize its business.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

**C) Formulation of Realistic Assumptions (5 Years)**

The original model's smooth 3% growth is a critical flaw. It ignores the planned expiration of the PVH licenses (Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger), which the company has stated will be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2028 (calendar year 2027). A realistic model must account for this revenue loss and the company's strategy to replace it.

*   **Revenue for Years 1â€“5:**
    *   **Year 1 (FY25):** -2% decline. A slight decrease as the transition begins and consumer spending remains cautious.
    *   **Year 2 (FY26):** -5% decline. An acceleration of the license wind-down.
    *   **Year 3 (FY27):** -18% decline. The most significant impact year as the majority of the remaining licensed revenue is lost.
    *   **Year 4 (FY28):** +4% growth. A rebound year, with growth driven entirely by the core owned brands (DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld), new acquisitions, and new licenses like Nautica.
    *   **Year 5 (FY29):** +4% growth. Continued stable growth from the new business structure.
*   **Margin Path:** A stable 9.0% operating margin is unlikely. The licensed business was high-margin. As G-III invests in its owned brands, marketing expenses will rise, and margins will likely compress before stabilizing.
    *   **Operating Margin:** Assumed to be 8.0% in Year 1, compressing to 7.8% during the transition, and recovering to 8.5% by Year 5 as the new strategy matures and gains scale.
*   **Taxes:** A 28% effective tax rate is maintained, consistent with guidance.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed to be 1.2% of revenue, slightly lower than historical averages to reflect a less complex business post-transition.
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeled as 1.0% of the absolute change in revenue.
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:** SBC is treated as a real cash expense. The diluted share count is projected to decrease by 1.0% annually, a more conservative assumption for buybacks during a period of business transition.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| Year (Fiscal) | Revenue | EBIT | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 (2025) | $3,051.72 | $244.14 | $153.95 |
| 2 (2026) | $2,899.13 | $229.03 | $147.24 |
| 3 (2027) | $2,377.29 | $185.43 | $124.77 |
| 4 (2028) | $2,472.38 | $203.94 | $145.42 |
| 5 (2029) | $2,571.28 | $218.56 | $157.06 |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.3% (current 10-year US Treasury yield)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5% (a more standard market assumption)
    *   **Beta:** 1.30 (reflective of the apparel sector's cyclicality and company-specific transition risk)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.3% + 1.30 \* 5.5% = 11.45%**
*   **Cost of Debt:** 5.5% (estimated cost of new debt for a similar-rated company)
*   **WACC:** 10.4%

**F) Terminal Value**

The original model's cross-check multiple of 8.0x EV/EBITDA is too high for a no-moat, cyclical apparel company post-transition. A more realistic multiple is aligned with its historical and peer group average. The Exit Multiple approach is more appropriate here than Gordon Growth, as it better reflects how the market would likely value this type of business at a mature stage.

*   **Method:** Exit Multiple Method.
*   **Terminal Year EBITDA:** $260 million (calculated from Terminal Year EBIT + D&A)
*   **Exit Multiple:** **6.5x EV/EBITDA**. This is a realistic multiple for a mid-sized apparel company and aligns with G-III's historical trading range (5x-7x).
*   **Terminal Value = $260M \* 6.5 = $1,690 million**

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of 5-Year FCFF:** $549 million
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $1,027 million
*   **Enterprise Value:** **$1,576 million** (PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value)
*   **Equity Value:** **$1,746 million** (Enterprise Value - Net Debt, where Net Debt is negative at -$170M)

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:** $39.24 per share
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** $28.00 (assumes slower core growth and further margin erosion)
    *   **High/Bull Case:** $50.00 (assumes faster replacement of lost revenue and better margins)
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 25% margin of safety from the base-case fair value results in a MOS price of **$29.43**.

**Risk Notes**

The key risks to this valuation remain valid and are even more acute given the transition:

*   **Execution Risk:** The primary risk is the company's ability to successfully scale its owned brands (DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld) and new licenses to replace the lost CK/TH revenue.
*   **Margin Compression:** Increased marketing and operational spend required to build its own brands could permanently lower the company's margin profile.
*   **Changes in consumer preferences:** The apparel industry is subject to rapid changes in fashion trends, and a failure to adapt could hurt sales.
*   **Economic downturn:** A recession could severely impact discretionary spending, hindering the company's growth plans during a critical period.
*   **Supply chain disruptions:** Any disruptions to the company's supply chain could lead to delays in production and delivery, which could hurt sales.

final answer is 39.24 $
