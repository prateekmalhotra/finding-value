**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clear Secure benefits from a strong network effect: as more airports and partners join the network, the service becomes more valuable to members, which in turn attracts more partners.

---
Synthesis: Clear Secure, Inc. scores well on Fisher's checklist, with strong positives in its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and financial strength. The company's network effects and established relationships in the aviation industry provide a significant competitive advantage. The primary areas of concern are the recent executive turnover and a lack of information regarding management depth, which could impact the company's ability to execute on its growth strategy. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of the TSA PreCheck® enrollment program and the expansion of the CLEAR1 platform into new verticals. A "No" on executive relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with a period of stability in the executive ranks and more clarity on succession planning.

fisher score is 13 / 15
