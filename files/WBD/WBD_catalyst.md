| Catalyst Title | Type | Timing Window | Impact (Small/Medium/Large + % Range) | Probability (0–100%) | One-Line Evidence Citation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Corporate Separation into Two Public Companies | M&A | By mid-2026 | Large (>30%) | 95% | "Warner Bros. Discovery will break into two separate publicly traded companies..." (The Week, June 24, 2025). |
| Successful Launch of Standalone Streaming & Studios Business | Product / Financial | 12-24 months | Medium (10-30%) | 85% | "...one focused on streaming and films, the other attempting to keep the cable business alive." (The Week, June 24, 2025). |
| Insider Buying by Director Anton J. Levy | Corporate Action | August 11, 2025 | Small (0-10%) | 100% | Director Anton J. Levy purchased 325,000 shares at $10.92 on August 11, 2025 (OpenInsider, August 13, 2025). |

### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Insider Buying by Director Anton J. Levy
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On August 11, 2025, Director Anton J. Levy purchased 325,000 shares of WBD at an average price of $10.92 per share, for a total of $3,550,000. This represents a 52% increase in his holdings.
*   **Mechanism:** This significant open-market purchase by a board member can signal to the market that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued. This can increase investor confidence and attract new buyers, leading to a higher share price.
*   **Timing:** The purchase was made on August 11, 2025, and disclosed on August 13, 2025. The impact is immediate and ongoing.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: $10.92 (price of the transaction)
    *   Base: $12.00 (a modest increase in valuation)
    *   High: $14.00 (a more significant increase in valuation)
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (0-10%). While a positive signal, insider buying alone is unlikely to drive a massive re-rating of the stock without other fundamental catalysts.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 100%. The transaction has been publicly disclosed.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The signal's impact will be amplified if other insiders also purchase shares or if the company announces other positive news.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Further insider transactions on OpenInsider.
    *   Analyst reports commenting on the insider activity.
    *   Share price and trading volume in the weeks following the disclosure.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The market may dismiss the purchase as a one-off event.
    *   Negative company or market news could overshadow the positive signal.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a positive data point, but not a standalone reason to initiate a large position.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Corporate Separation into Two Public Companies
*   **Type:** M&A
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Warner Bros. Discovery has announced its intention to separate into two publicly traded companies: a "Streaming & Studios" company and a "Global Linear Networks" company. The transaction is expected to be tax-free and completed by mid-2026.
*   **Mechanism:** This separation is designed to unlock shareholder value by allowing each company to focus on its distinct business model and strategic priorities. The "Streaming & Studios" company will be a growth-oriented entity, while the "Global Linear Networks" company will be a value-oriented, cash-flow-generating business. This separation could lead to a higher aggregate valuation as investors can more clearly value each business and its prospects.
*   **Timing:** The separation is planned to be completed by mid-2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: A modest increase in the combined market capitalization of the two new entities, driven by improved focus and investor clarity.
    *   Base: A significant increase in combined market capitalization as each company is valued more appropriately by the market.
    *   High: A substantial increase in combined market capitalization if the "Streaming & Studios" company achieves a high-growth multiple and the "Global Linear Networks" company is valued as a stable, high-yield investment.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A successful separation could lead to a significant re-rating of the combined businesses.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has publicly announced its intention to separate, and has secured a $17.5 billion bridge facility to support the transaction.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Successful execution of the separation transaction, including regulatory approvals.
    *   Favorable market conditions at the time of the separation.
    *   Effective management teams for each of the two new companies.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Announcements regarding the leadership teams of the two new companies.
    *   SEC filings related to the separation.
    *   Analyst reports on the pro-forma financials of the two new entities.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The separation could be delayed or blocked by regulatory hurdles.
    *   The market may not value the two new companies as highly as anticipated.
    *   The separation process could be disruptive to the company's operations.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is a significant and highly probable catalyst that could unlock substantial value for shareholders.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Corporate Separation:**
*   **Assumption:** The current market capitalization of WBD is approximately $18 billion (Form 10-K, June 30, 2024). A successful separation could lead to a 30% increase in the combined value of the two new companies.
*   **Formula:** Current Market Cap \* (1 + Price Impact) = Post-Separation Market Cap
*   **Calculation:** $18 billion \* (1 + 0.30) = $23.4 billion
*   **Citation:** Form 10-K, Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc., Filed February 27, 2025.

**2. Successful Streaming & Studios Launch:**
*   **Assumption:** The new "Streaming & Studios" company achieves a valuation multiple in line with other high-growth streaming companies.
*   **Formula:** (Streaming & Studios Revenue \* Multiple) + (Global Linear Networks Value) = Total Value
*   **Calculation:** This calculation is highly speculative without pro-forma financials for the new entities. However, if the "Streaming & Studios" company generates $20 billion in revenue and is valued at 2x sales, that would be a $40 billion valuation for that entity alone.
*   **Citation:** This is an inference based on the planned separation and typical valuation metrics for streaming companies.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for WBD are positive but likely to be overshadowed by the longer-term corporate separation. The recent insider buying is a bullish signal, but the market is likely to remain focused on the execution of the separation plan. The short-term market signal is neutral to slightly positive, with the potential for significant upside in the long term.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failure to Execute Corporate Separation:** If the planned separation is blocked by regulators or abandoned by the company, the primary long-term catalyst would be eliminated. (PR Newswire, June 9, 2025).
2.  **Deterioration of Streaming Business:** If the "Streaming & Studios" business fails to achieve its growth targets post-separation, the new entity could be valued lower than anticipated, negating the value-unlocking thesis. (The Week, June 24, 2025).
3.  **Macroeconomic Downturn:** A significant recession could reduce consumer spending on entertainment and advertising, negatively impacting both of the new companies. (Form 10-K, February 27, 2025).

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

The planned corporate separation of Warner Bros. Discovery into two distinct publicly traded companies is a compelling long-term catalyst that could unlock significant shareholder value. While near-term catalysts such as insider buying are positive, investors should focus on the execution of the separation, which is expected to be completed by mid-2026. The most important indicator to monitor will be the release of pro-forma financial statements for the two new entities, which will allow for a more precise valuation of the post-separation businesses.
