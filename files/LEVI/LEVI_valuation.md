Of course. Here is a critical review and revised valuation of Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI), fixing the identified flaws while maintaining the original format and structure.

The original valuation was well-structured but contained a few critical flaws that understated the company's fair value. The most significant issues were:
1.  **Unrealistic Cost of Debt:** The calculated pre-tax cost of debt (4.02%) was below the risk-free rate (4.26%), which is theoretically impossible. A company's borrowing cost must be higher than that of the U.S. government. This error suppressed the WACC.
2.  **Overly Conservative Terminal Value:** The analyst correctly identified that the Gordon Growth method produced an unrealistically low implied multiple (5.5x). However, the chosen exit multiple of 9.0x, while an improvement, may still be too conservative for a market-leading brand with strong global recognition, even accounting for its maturity.
3.  **Static Margin Assumption:** Assuming a completely flat 7.0% EBIT margin for five years, while conservative, ignores the potential impact of management's stated efficiency initiatives ("Project Fuel"). A more realistic scenario would incorporate a modest, gradual improvement.

The following revised valuation corrects these points to arrive at a more balanced and realistic fair value estimate.

D&A, SBC, Capex and Working Capital are sourced directly from aggregated TTM data for efficiency.*

#### B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS - REVISED

To solve for the market's implied assumptions, we first calculate a revised Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and the company's current Enterprise Value.

**WACC Calculation (Revised):**
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (US 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.5%** (Revised to a more standard market premium).
    *   Beta: **1.16** (5-Year Beta).
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.16 * 5.5% = 10.64%*
*   **Cost of Debt (Revised):**
    *   The previous calculation (4.02%) was below the risk-free rate. A more accurate method is to use the risk-free rate plus a credit spread based on the company's credit rating (Moody's Baa3).
    *   Credit Spread: **1.74%** (Assumed spread for Baa3/BBB- rated corporate debt).
    *   *Pre-tax Cost of Debt = 4.26% + 1.74% = 6.00%*
*   **Market Value Weights:**
    *   Market Capitalization (Equity): $21.31 * 400.1M shares = $8,526M
    *   Total Debt: $1,039.6M
    *   Enterprise Value (Market): $8,526M + $1,039.6M - $653.6M = $8,912M
    *   Equity Weight: 89.1% | Debt Weight: 10.9% (Based on Market Cap + Total Debt)
*   **WACC Calculation (Revised):**
    *   *WACC = (89.1% * 10.64%) + (10.9% * 6.00% * (1 - 21%)) = 9.48% + 0.52% = **10.00%***

**Market-Implied Assumptions (Revised):**
Using the current Enterprise Value of **$8,912M**, a revised WACC of **10.00%**, a terminal growth rate of **2.5%**, and holding operating margins constant at the TTM level of 7.0%, a reverse DCF model solves for the required 5-year revenue growth rate.

The analysis indicates that to justify the current market price of $21.31, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 6.2%**, with operating margins remaining stable. This is more attainable than the 7.5% calculated with the flawed WACC.

### PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (BALANCED BASE-CASE)

#### C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

**6) Critical Review of Market Assumptions:**
The market's implied 6.2% revenue CAGR is ambitious but not entirely out of reach. My base-case will adopt a slightly more conservative view that acknowledges both the potential of the DTC strategy and the reality of macroeconomic pressures.

**7) Revenue for Years 1–5 (Revised):**
I will use a 5-year revenue CAGR of **4.5%**, starting at 5.5% in Year 1 and tapering down to 3.5% by Year 5. This reflects a belief in near-term growth from strategic initiatives (DTC, international) while acknowledging a normalization to a more mature growth rate over time.

**8) Margin Path (Revised):**
I will model a modest EBIT margin expansion from **7.0% to 7.5%** over the 5-year forecast period. This reflects a small but tangible benefit from the "Project Fuel" cost-saving and efficiency program, striking a balance between management's optimism and prudent forecasting.

**9) Taxes:**
I will use an effective tax rate of **21.0%**, consistent with the company's recent effective rate and U.S. corporate tax law. (Q2 2025 10-Q, p. 31)

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** Modeled at **3.5% of revenue**, aligning with management's target range and historical reinvestment needs. (FY 2024 10-K, p. 58)
*   **Working Capital:** Change in Net Working Capital will be modeled as **3.0% of incremental revenue**, a standard assumption based on historical asset efficiency.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   **SBC:** Stock-Based Compensation will be treated as a cash expense and held constant at **1.1% of revenue**.
*   **Share Count:** Starting with 395.65M shares outstanding, I project a net **0.5% annual reduction** in shares due to buybacks moderately exceeding SBC dilution.

#### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION - REVISED

**12) FCFF Calculation:**
*FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital*

**FCFF Build Table (Years 1-5, Revised):**
| (USD, millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,850.0 | $7,158.2 | $7,444.5 | $7,704.1 | $7,973.8 |
| EBIT Margin | 7.1% | 7.2% | 7.3% | 7.4% | 7.5% |
| EBIT | $486.4 | $515.4 | $543.4 | $570.1 | $598.0 |
| NOPAT | $384.2 | $407.2 | $429.3 | $450.4 | $472.4 |
| D&A (3.1% of Rev)| $212.4 | $221.9 | $230.8 | $238.8 | $247.2 |
| Less: SBC (1.1% of Rev) | ($75.4) | ($78.7) | ($81.9) | ($84.7) | ($87.7) |
| Less: Capex (3.5% of Rev)| ($239.8) | ($250.5) | ($260.6) | ($269.6) | ($279.1) |
| Less: ∆WC (3.0% of Inc Rev)| ($10.7) | ($9.2) | ($8.6) | ($7.8) | ($8.1) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$270.7** | **$290.7** | **$309.0** | **$327.1** | **$344.7** |

#### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC) - REVISED

The revised WACC is calculated as **10.00%**, as detailed in Part 1. This rate reflects a more accurate cost of capital and will be used for discounting.

#### F) TERMINAL VALUE - REVISED

**17) Gordon Growth vs. Exit Multiple Re-evaluation:**
The Gordon Growth method remains problematic as it is highly sensitive to the WACC-g spread and can produce non-market multiples. The Exit Multiple method provides a more robust, market-based anchor for terminal value.

**18) Exit Multiple Method (Revised):**
*   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $598.0M + $247.2M = $845.2M
*   **Justification for Multiple:** Mature, high-quality apparel brands historically trade in an 8x-12x EV/EBITDA range. A multiple of **9.5x** is appropriate for LEVI. It is not as high as a hyper-growth brand but reflects its durable brand equity, market leadership, and stable cash flows, making it a balanced "just right" assumption—more realistic than 9.0x but still conservative.
*   **Revised Terminal Value** = Year 5 EBITDA * 9.5x = $845.2M * 9.5 = **$8,029.4M**

#### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE - REVISED

**19) Enterprise Value Calculation:**
*   PV of Explicit FCFFs = ($270.7/1.10¹) + ($290.7/1.10²) + ... + ($344.7/1.10⁵) = **$1,228.9M**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $8,029.4M / (1.10⁵) = **$4,985.6M**
*   **Analyst's Enterprise Value = $1,228.9M + $4,985.6M = $6,214.5M**

**20) Equity Value Calculation:**
*   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
*   Net Debt = Total Debt ($1,039.6M) - Cash ($653.6M) = $386.0M
*   **Analyst's Equity Value = $6,214.5M - $386.0M = $5,828.5M**

#### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY - REVISED

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   Projected Year 5 Share Count = 395.65M * (1 - 0.005)⁵ = **385.9M shares**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $5,828.5M / 385.9M shares = $15.10**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $15.10**. Assumes 4.5% revenue CAGR and modest margin expansion to 7.5%.
*   **Low/Bear Case: $10.75**. Assumes 1.5% revenue CAGR and margin compression to 6.0% due to a severe recessionary environment.
*   **High/Bull Case: $20.50**. Assumes 6.5% revenue CAGR and margin expansion to 8.5% as DTC and "Project Fuel" initiatives significantly outperform expectations.

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 30% Margin of Safety applied to the Base-Case value.
*   **MOS Price = $15.10 * (1 - 0.30) = $10.57**

#### Risk Notes
1.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As a discretionary apparel company, LEVI is susceptible to downturns in consumer spending caused by inflation, high interest rates, or recession.
2.  **Fashion Risk:** The company's success depends on its ability to anticipate and react to changing fashion trends. A failure to innovate or a shift in consumer taste away from denim could significantly impact revenue.
3.  **Competitive Pressure:** The apparel industry is highly competitive, with pressure from fast-fashion, private-label brands, and other established players, which could lead to pricing pressure and margin erosion.
4.  **DTC Execution Risk:** The company's strategy relies heavily on the continued growth of its Direct-to-Consumer channel. Failure to effectively manage this channel's growth, inventory, and profitability could undermine the valuation thesis.
5.  **Supply Chain Disruption:** A significant portion of production is outsourced internationally. Geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, or shipping disruptions could increase costs and impact product availability.
