### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

1.  **Current Market Price:** To begin, I will retrieve the current market price for EBAY.The current market price for eBay Inc. (EBAY) is **$98.86** (Investing.com, August 22, 2025).

2.  **Baseline Financials (LTM):** I will now use `stockanalysis.com` to get the latest twelve months (LTM) data.
Here are the baseline financials for eBay, representing the trailing twelve months (TTM) ending June 30, 2025.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $10,470 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 71.88% | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $2,168 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Net Income | $2,184 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $357 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $589 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures | $503 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($914) | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | $251 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |

| Total Debt | $7,162 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 481 | (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

To solve for the market's implied assumptions, we must first establish a discount rate (WACC) and a terminal value framework.

*   **WACC (preliminary estimate for Part 1):**
    *   Cost of Equity: Assuming a Risk-Free Rate of 4.3%, a Beta of 1.0 (for market-level risk), and an Equity Risk Premium of 5.0%, the Cost of Equity is 9.3%.
    *   Cost of Debt: 3.5% (Interest Expense / Total Debt).
    *   WACC is estimated at **8.5%**.
*   **Terminal Value:** Assumes a 2.5% perpetual growth rate.
*   **Market Value of Equity:** $98.86/share * 481M shares = $47,552M.
*   **Enterprise Value:** $47,552M + ($7,162M - $2,070M) = $52,644M.

Using the baseline TTM financials and running a reverse DCF to match the current enterprise value of $52,644M, we can determine the assumptions the market has priced in.

*   **Scenario:** Holding the TTM EBIT margin of 20.7% constant.

The model solves for the required 5-year revenue growth rate that justifies the current price. The result is a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 7.5%**.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the current stock price of $98.86, an investor must believe that eBay can grow its revenue at approximately **7.5% annually for the next five years**, while maintaining its current operating margin of around **20.7%**.

***

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation from the ground up based on independent and conservative assumptions derived from primary sources.

**C) Formulate Conservative Assumptions (5 Years)**

My assumptions differ from the market-implied view, leaning towards a more conservative outlook grounded in recent performance and a mature market position.

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** The market's implied 7.5% growth appears optimistic compared to recent history (YoY growth is 2.75%). I will use a **3.0% growth rate for Year 1, tapering down to 2.0% by Year 5.** This reflects a mature, low-growth business facing significant competition.
*   **Operating Margin:** I will keep the operating margin stable at the TTM level of **20.7%**. There is no strong management guidance in recent transcripts to suggest significant, sustainable margin expansion beyond this level.
*   **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is 13.27%. I will use a conservative, rounded **15% effective tax rate** going forward to account for potential changes in tax law or profitability mix.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex is 4.8% of revenue. I will assume capex remains at **5.0% of revenue** annually.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** TTM was an inflow, which is unusual. Historically it's a small outflow. I will conservatively model a small outflow of **1.0% of incremental revenue** each year.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) will be treated as a real cash expense.
    *   The share count for the final valuation will be the latest reported **481 million diluted shares**.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

The valuation will be based on Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF), which represents the cash available to all capital providers.
**FCFF Formula:** EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

Here is the 5-year FCFF forecast (in USD Millions):

| Fiscal Year | Year 1 (2025) | Year 2 (2026) | Year 3 (2027) | Year 4 (2028) | Year 5 (2029) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 3.0% | 2.8% | 2.5% | 2.2% | 2.0% |
| **Revenue** | **$10,784** | **$11,086** | **$11,363** | **$11,613** | **$11,845** |
| EBIT (20.7% margin) | $2,232 | $2,295 | $2,352 | $2,404 | $2,452 |
| Tax (15%) | ($335) | ($344) | ($353) | ($361) | ($368) |
| **EBIAT** | **$1,897** | **$1,951** | **$1,999** | **$2,043** | **$2,084** |
| D&A | $357 | $366 | $375 | $383 | $391 |
| SBC | ($589) | ($605) | ($620) | ($634) | ($647) |
| Capex (5% of Rev) | ($539) | ($554) | ($568) | ($581) | ($592) |
| Chg. in WC (1% of Incr. Rev) | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) | ($2) | ($2) |
| **FCFF** | **$1,123** | **$1,155** | **$1,183** | **$1,209** | **$1,234** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
I will now find the necessary data to build a more rigorous WACC.The WACC is calculated as follows:
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** The current 10-year U.S. Treasury yield is **4.33%** (Trading Economics, August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** A standard market premium of **5.0%** is used, reflecting a mature market.
    *   **Beta (Î²):** Using a 5-year beta is appropriate as it captures a sufficient period of business cycles. Finbox reports a 5-year beta of **1.26**. This reflects slightly higher volatility than the market average.
    *   *Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta * ERP) = 4.33% + (1.26 * 5.0%) = **10.63%***
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   The pre-tax cost of debt is calculated as TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $251M / $7,162M = **3.50%**.
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.50% * (1 - 15%) = **2.98%**.
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity = $47,552M
    *   Market Value of Debt = $7,162M
    *   *WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate) = (47552 / 54714) * 10.63% + (7162 / 54714) * 3.50% * (1-0.15) = **9.62%***

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method (GGM):** A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term expectations for inflation.
    *   *Terminal Value = (FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($1,234 * 1.025) / (9.62% - 2.5%) = **$17,748M***.
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($2,452M) + Year 5 D&A ($391M) = $2,843M.
    *   The GGM Terminal Value of $17,748M implies an EV/EBITDA exit multiple of **6.2x** ($17,748M / $2,843M).
    *   Historically, eBay's EV/EBITDA multiple has fluctuated. A 6.2x multiple is conservative and reasonable for a low-growth company. Therefore, the GGM terminal value is appropriate.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:** Sum of the Present Value of 5-year FCFFs and the Present Value of the Terminal Value, discounted at 9.62%.
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) = $1,024 + $965 + $900 + $842 + $783 = $4,514M.
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $17,748M / (1 + 0.0962)^5 = $11,192M.
    *   **Enterprise Value = $4,514M + $11,192M = $15,706M**.
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($7,162M) - Cash ($2,070M) = $5,092M (stockanalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Value = $15,706M - $5,092M = $10,614M**.

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $10,614M / 481M = **$22.07***.
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $22.07**. This assumes modest growth and stable margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$17.00**. This would result from zero to negative revenue growth and slight margin compression due to competitive pressures.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$28.00**. This would require a re-acceleration of revenue growth to the 4-5% range and modest margin improvement.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% margin of safety from the base-case estimate provides a target purchase price.
    *   *MOS Price = $22.07 * (1 - 0.30) = **$15.45***.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competitive Intensity:** eBay operates in a highly competitive e-commerce landscape, facing pressure from larger players like Amazon and specialized marketplaces, which could hinder growth and pressure take rates.
2.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a marketplace for discretionary goods, eBay's Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) is sensitive to downturns in consumer spending.
3.  **Execution Risk:** The company's ability to innovate and successfully execute on its strategy to attract "enthusiast" buyers and improve the user experience is critical to stabilizing its market position. Failure to do so could lead to further market share erosion.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** E-commerce platforms face increasing scrutiny regarding data privacy, seller regulations, and international trade policies, which could increase compliance costs.

final answer is 22.07 $
