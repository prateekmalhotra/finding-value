### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On Holding's core patented technology, CloudTec®, is a key differentiator and a testament to their R&D effectiveness. The company continues to innovate with new product launches and technologies like LightSpray. However, specific R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue is not readily available in the provided documents, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. While new product launches are mentioned, the success rate and time-to-market metrics are not disclosed.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On's investor relations page highlights that 46% of its leaders are women and that the company has over 100 nationalities represented. While these statistics are positive, there is no detailed information in the provided sources regarding employee attrition, engagement scores, union relations, or other key metrics to fully assess labor and personnel relations.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's founders remain actively involved as Executive Co-Chairmen. In April 2025, Martin Hoffmann, the former CFO, became the sole CEO after the departure of the previous co-CEO, which could be a sign of instability. However, the founders' continued involvement and the promotion of a long-term executive to the CEO role suggest a degree of stability and a consistent vision.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the founders and the CEO are prominently featured, there is limited information in the provided documents about the broader management team. The recent departure of a co-CEO raises questions about management depth. Without further details on the experience and tenure of other key executives, it is difficult to assess the overall depth of the management team.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On Holding AG's financial statements are audited, and the company provides detailed financial information in its quarterly and annual reports. However, there is no specific information available in the provided sources to assess the quality of its cost analysis and accounting controls beyond standard financial reporting.
**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On's key competitive advantage lies in its patented CloudTec® cushioning technology, which provides a unique running experience. This innovation has allowed the company to build a strong brand and a loyal following in a competitive market. The company's emphasis on design and premium positioning further differentiates it from competitors. The company also has a strong relationship with tennis star Roger Federer, who is a shareholder and has a signature shoe line, "The Roger."
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Co-founder David Allemann’s statement in the Q2 2025 earnings call, "Our Q2 results leave no doubt: On is playing the long game," explicitly states the company's long-term focus. The company is investing heavily in marketing, innovation, and technology projects like LightSpray to drive future growth. This willingness to invest in the brand and technology, even at the expense of short-term profits, demonstrates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, On Holding AG had a cash and cash equivalents balance of CHF 846.6 million. The company's current ratio of 2.53 indicates a strong liquidity position. While the company had a net loss in Q2 2025, this was impacted by foreign exchange effects. Given its strong cash position and healthy balance sheet, the company appears well-positioned to fund its growth without significant equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Q2 2025, On Holding AG missed both earnings and revenue forecasts significantly. Despite this, the company held an earnings call and openly discussed the results, and even raised its full-year guidance for net sales and gross profit margin. This willingness to communicate and provide future guidance during a challenging quarter suggests a high degree of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the provided sources to suggest any lack of integrity from the management of On Holding AG. There are no mentions of legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or other governance red flags. However, without a more in-depth review of the company's governance documents and history, it is difficult to definitively assess the integrity of the management.
**Answer:** No

---
**Synthesis:**
On Holding AG scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its product, sales, and financial performance. The company has a strong brand, innovative products, and a significant growth runway ahead. The company's financials are healthy, with high and improving profit margins and a strong balance sheet. The biggest areas of uncertainty are related to the company's internal operations, such as R&D effectiveness, management depth, and labor relations. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with greater transparency on these issues. Specifically, providing more detail on R&D spending and effectiveness, highlighting the depth of the management team beyond the founders and CEO, and disclosing more metrics related to employee satisfaction would help to turn the "No" answers to "Yes."

**fisher score is 10 / 15**
