The company is making significant investments in expanding its store network to 20,000 stores by 2026 and investing \$1-1.5 billion in digital and technology over five years.

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?

The company has a significant share buyback program, totaling \$184 million in the second quarter of 2025, which indicates confidence in its financial position and a commitment to returning value to shareholders rather than diluting them. The company's leverage ratio is low, and it has a net cash position, which suggests it has ample capacity to fund its growth plans without resorting to equity financing.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company regularly holds earnings conference calls and investor day presentations, which are made available to the public. The transcripts of these calls provide detailed information on the company's performance and strategy. While this indicates a good level of communication, without a specific instance of "trouble" to analyze, it's difficult to definitively assess their candor in difficult situations. However, their consistent communication schedule and detailed presentations suggest a commitment to transparency.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's 2024 10-K filing and recent news searches do not reveal any material legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of the management. The company has a well-defined corporate governance structure.

**Synthesis:**

Yum China scores very highly on Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a strong and well-managed business with significant growth potential. The company's strengths lie in its aggressive and strategic expansion into lower-tier Chinese cities, its commitment to innovation through new store formats and digital technology, and its robust financial position. The most significant variables that could change this score in the next 12–24 months are the success of its new cost-effective concepts like Pizza Hut Wow and K-Coffee, the continued growth of its digital ecosystem, and its ability to maintain margin improvements in the face of a potentially softening consumer demand. A "No" would be warranted on any of the points if there was evidence of a slowdown in store expansion, a failure of their new concepts to gain traction, a significant data breach, or any major governance issues.

fisher score is 15 / 15
