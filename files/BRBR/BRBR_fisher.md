BellRing Brands, Inc., August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed include Q3 2025 earnings reports, 2025 proxy statements, and various news and industry analyses.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** BellRing Brands operates in the convenient nutrition category, which is experiencing robust growth. The ready-to-drink (RTD) shake market, a key segment for the company, grew 16% in the third quarter of 2025, with 70% of that growth driven by volume. BellRing's Premier Protein brand is a leader in this category, with a 25% market share and 19% consumption growth in the same quarter. The company is also expanding its distribution and launching new products, such as the Indulgence and Almondmilk shake lines, to attract new customers.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** BellRing has a stated strategy of new product launches and innovation. Recent examples include the introduction of plant-based protein options and new flavors for its existing product lines. The company is also focused on expanding its distribution network, both domestically and internationally, to reach new customers.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While BellRing emphasizes innovation, it does not disclose its research and development spending as a percentage of revenue. This makes it difficult to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of its R&D efforts relative to its size and competitors. However, the successful launch of new product lines and flavors, as mentioned in earnings calls, suggests a degree of effectiveness.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** BellRing has demonstrated strong sales growth, with a 6% year-over-year increase in net sales in the third quarter of 2025. The company has a multi-channel distribution strategy, with a strong presence in club stores, food, drug, mass retailers, and e-commerce. Premier Protein has achieved a 30% market share in the RTD protein shake category and has seen significant distribution gains.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the third quarter of 2025, BellRing's adjusted gross profit margin was 35.1%, and its adjusted EBITDA margin was 22%. However, the adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, due to input cost inflation and increased promotional activity. The company's operating profit was also significantly impacted by a $68 million provision for legal matters.
**Answer:** No

**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's proxy statement indicates a stable board of directors and executive team. However, without more information on succession planning and the internal dynamics of the executive team, it is difficult to assess the quality of their relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership team is detailed in its proxy statement, and the CEO, Darcy Horn Davenport, has been with the company since its formation. However, there is limited public information about the depth of management beyond the named executive officers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** BellRing's financial statements are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a reputable accounting firm.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** BellRing's success is closely tied to the brand strength and market leadership of Premier Protein. The company's ability to maintain its brand loyalty and market share in the face of growing competition from private-label and other branded products is a key indicator of its long-term success. The company's strong relationships with club stores are a significant competitive advantage.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the third quarter of 2025, BellRing repurchased 1.3 million shares for $83.0 million, and has $197.0 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization. This indicates a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and suggests that the company is not currently considering equity financing. The company's net debt is $971 million, with a net leverage ratio of 2 times.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed financial information. However, the recent investigation into securities fraud violations, which alleges that the company issued misleading statements and failed to disclose pertinent information to investors, raises serious questions about management's candor.
**Answer:** No

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The investigation into securities fraud violations, coupled with a recent $68 million provision for legal matters related to the company's discontinued Joint Juice brand, casts doubt on the integrity of the management team.

---
**Synthesis:** BellRing Brands exhibits strength in its market-leading products and its commitment to growth through innovation and distribution expansion. However, the company faces challenges related to declining profit margins and serious questions about its corporate governance and the integrity of its management team. The ongoing securities fraud investigation is a significant concern that could have a lasting impact on the company's reputation and financial performance. Over the next 12-24 months, the resolution of this investigation and the company's ability to stabilize its profit margins will be the most critical factors in determining its future success. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for points 14 and 15 if the securities fraud investigation is resolved in the company's favor and there are no further legal or ethical issues. For point 5, a sustained improvement in gross and operating margins would be necessary.
