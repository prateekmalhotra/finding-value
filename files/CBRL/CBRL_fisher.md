**Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., August 23, 2025, Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-Q filed March 6, 2025.**

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cracker Barrel's long-term strategy focuses on three main imperatives: driving relevancy, delivering food and experiences guests love, and growing profitability. The company has a strategic transformation plan built on five pillars, including refining the brand, enhancing the menu, and evolving the store and guest experience. As of January 31, 2025, the company operated 657 Cracker Barrel stores and 69 Maple Street Biscuit Company locations, indicating some expansion and diversification. However, the most recent financial data shows modest revenue growth, with a 1.5% increase in the second quarter of 2025.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a strategic transformation plan that includes menu innovation, improving the guest experience through store remodels and refreshes, and leveraging technology like the Cracker Barrel Rewards loyalty program. The company expects to complete 25-30 remodels and 25-30 store refreshes in 2025. This demonstrates a commitment to ongoing development.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Cracker Barrel does not have a traditional R&D department like a technology company, its "R&D" would be in menu development, retail product sourcing, and guest experience innovation. The effectiveness is demonstrated through metrics like comparable store sales. In the second quarter of 2025, comparable store restaurant sales increased by 4.7%, driven by a 7.4% average check increase, which suggests some success in menu pricing and mix. However, comparable restaurant guest traffic decreased by 2.7%.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales performance is mixed. While comparable store restaurant sales increased 3.8% for the first six months of 2025, this was primarily driven by a 6.6% increase in average check, while guest traffic decreased by 2.8%. Comparable store retail sales decreased by 0.6% over the same period. This reliance on price increases to drive sales growth, coupled with declining customer traffic, suggests a sales organization that is not "above-average."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the second quarter of 2025, Cracker Barrel's operating income was 3.1% of total revenue, down from 3.3% in the same quarter of the prior year. For the first six months of 2025, operating income was 2.0% of total revenue, down from 2.4% in the prior year. These are relatively thin margins, and the declining trend is a concern.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving profitability through strategic pricing, cost management, and operational efficiencies. The decrease in restaurant cost of goods sold as a percentage of restaurant revenue in the second quarter of 2025 was a result of menu price increases and a shift to lower-cost menu items. However, other store operating expenses and general and administrative expenses have increased as a percentage of revenue.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategic plan includes "elevating the employee experience" through upgraded training and development programs and simplifying job roles. In the first six months of 2025, the company settled a series of wage and hour arbitrations for approximately $3,300,000. This suggests that labor relations have not been without issues.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company incurred proxy contest expenses of $5,263,000 in the second quarter of 2025 and $8,220,000 in the first six months of 2025 in connection with the 2024 annual shareholders meeting. Such a contest suggests a significant disagreement between shareholders and management/the board, which is a clear indicator that executive relations are not "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I am unable to determine the depth of management from the provided documents.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [N/A]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited, and the 10-Q report for the quarter ended January 31, 2025, states that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cracker Barrel's unique combination of a full-service restaurant and a retail gift shop provides a differentiated experience. However, the company faces significant competition in the restaurant industry. The recent decline in guest traffic suggests that this differentiation may not be as strong a competitive advantage as it once was.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strategic transformation plan and is increasing capital expenditures for remodels and technology improvements. It expects to spend $160 million to $180 million in fiscal 2025 and $600 million to $700 million over the next three years. This willingness to invest for the long term, even at the expense of short-term earnings, is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of January 31, 2025, Cracker Barrel had $471,465,000 in long-term debt and $491,996,000 in borrowing availability under its revolving credit facility. The company's primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and its credit facility. While the company believes these sources will be sufficient to fund its plans, the significant increase in capital expenditures could strain its finances. However, there is no immediate indication of a need for equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1067294/000155837025002351/cbrl-20250131x10q.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I am unable to assess the candor of management's communications from the provided documents.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [N/A]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I did not find any evidence of legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of management in the provided documents. However, without a broader review of news and other sources, it is difficult to give a definitive "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [N/A]

---
**Synthesis:**
Cracker Barrel is at a critical juncture, with a strategic transformation plan in place to address declining guest traffic and enhance the brand's relevance. The company's willingness to invest heavily in store remodels and technology is a positive sign for its long-term outlook. However, the recent financial performance, characterized by thin and declining profit margins and a reliance on price increases to drive sales, is concerning. The recent proxy contest also suggests a significant level of shareholder dissatisfaction. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the strategic initiatives lead to a reversal of the negative guest traffic trend and an improvement in profitability. A key indicator to watch will be comparable store sales, with a particular focus on the guest traffic component. A sustained increase in guest traffic would be strong evidence that the turnaround plan is taking hold and would likely flip several "No" answers to "Yes."
