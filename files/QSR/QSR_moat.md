| **Total** | **100%** | | **27.4** |

### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** RBI's network effects are primarily driven by the scale of its franchise system, which creates a positive feedback loop for brand recognition and marketing efficiency. As more franchisees join the system, the brands become more ubiquitous, which in turn drives customer traffic and attracts new franchisees. However, the network effects are indirect and not as strong as those of a technology platform, as the value to an individual customer does not directly increase with the number of other customers.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   As of March 31, 2025, RBI had a total of 32,149 restaurants across its four brands, operating in more than 120 countries and territories (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   System-wide sales growth of 2.8% in Q1 2025 demonstrates the continued expansion of the network, albeit at a modest pace (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025).
*   The company is focused on expanding its network in underpenetrated regions, such as Western Canada for Tim Hortons, to enhance brand presence and accessibility (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Switching costs are primarily borne by the franchisees, who face significant financial and operational hurdles to de-franchise or switch to a competing brand. These costs include the initial franchise fee, real estate investments, and equipment purchases, which are largely sunk costs. While customers have low switching costs, the stickiness of the franchisee base provides a degree of stability and recurring revenue for RBI.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Franchisees are bound by long-term franchise agreements, which typically include provisions for royalty payments, advertising contributions, and adherence to brand standards (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   RBI's refranchising strategy for Carrols restaurants involves placing them with "more engaged smaller owner operators," indicating a preference for franchisees who are deeply invested in the system (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025).
*   The company's business model is over 90% franchised, highlighting its reliance on the long-term commitment of its franchisees (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** RBI's vast scale allows it to achieve significant cost advantages through centralized purchasing of food, packaging, and equipment. The company negotiates favorable terms with suppliers and leverages its distribution network to reduce costs for its franchisees. This scale-driven cost advantage is a key component of the company's value proposition to its franchisees and helps to maintain their profitability.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Supply chain sales of USD 611 million in Q1 2025, while slightly down from the prior year, demonstrate the significant volume of goods procured and distributed through RBI's system (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   The company's supply chain operations are a key part of its business model, providing a reliable and cost-effective source of ingredients and supplies for its franchisees (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   The Tim Hortons supply chain gross margin is expected to be roughly 19% for the full year 2025, indicating a profitable and efficient operation (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, August 20, 2025).

**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** RBI's portfolio of four well-established brands (Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs) represents its most significant intangible asset. These brands have strong consumer recognition and loyalty, which allows them to command a price premium over lesser-known competitors. The company's ongoing investments in marketing and product innovation help to maintain and enhance the value of these brands.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Indefinite-lived intangible assets, primarily consisting of the brand value of Tim Hortons, Burger King, Popeyes, and Firehouse Subs, were valued at USD 10.2 billion on March 31, 2025 (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   Tim Hortons is described as having "#1 brand love" in Canada, indicating a strong emotional connection with its customer base (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025).
*   RBI continues to invest in marketing and brand-building initiatives, such as the "Reclaim the Flame" plan for Burger King, to strengthen its competitive position (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** With over 32,000 restaurants worldwide, RBI has achieved a highly efficient scale of operations and a dense distribution network. This global footprint makes it difficult for new entrants to compete on a similar scale and allows RBI to leverage its existing infrastructure to expand its brands into new markets. The company's supply chain and logistics capabilities are a key enabler of its efficient scale.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   RBI's global network of 32,149 restaurants provides a wide distribution reach and significant market penetration (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   The company's net restaurant growth of 3.3% in Q1 2025 demonstrates its ability to continue expanding its distribution network (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025).
*   The international segment, with 15,696 restaurants, highlights the company's extensive global distribution and efficient scale in diverse markets (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** RBI is increasingly leveraging data from its digital channels, including its mobile apps and loyalty programs, to personalize marketing and improve the customer experience. However, the company's data advantage is still in its early stages and is not as developed as that of some of its competitors, particularly in the technology sector. The company is investing in its digital capabilities, but the full impact of its data strategy has yet to be realized.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The digital mix for Firehouse Subs is over 45%, the highest of RBI's home market brands, indicating a growing source of customer data (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025).
*   RBI is investing in restaurant technology as part of its "Royal Reset" plan for Burger King, which will likely enhance its data collection and analysis capabilities (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   The company's advertising and digital investments ("Fuel the Flame") for Burger King are designed to improve customer engagement and data-driven marketing (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** RBI's ecosystem is primarily centered around its franchise model and supply chain, which creates a platform for its franchisees to operate their businesses. However, the ecosystem is largely closed and does not have the same level of third-party participation or innovation as a true technology platform. While there are some integrations with third-party delivery services, the platform effects are relatively weak.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's business model is built on a franchise system, which can be considered a type of business ecosystem (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   RBI's supply chain provides a platform of services and products for its franchisees, creating a degree of interdependence (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   The company's digital initiatives are primarily focused on its own apps and loyalty programs, with limited integration with third-party platforms beyond delivery services.

**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** RBI operates in a highly regulated industry, with laws and regulations governing food safety, franchising, and labor practices. While these regulations create a barrier to entry for smaller, less-capitalized players, they do not provide a significant competitive advantage for RBI over its large, established competitors. The company is subject to the same regulatory requirements as its peers, and the risk of new, more stringent regulations is a constant threat.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company is subject to various federal, state, provincial, and local laws affecting the development and operation of its restaurants, including those relating to franchising, labor, and food safety (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   RBI is currently a defendant in several class-action lawsuits, which highlights the legal and regulatory risks it faces (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   Changes in tax laws and regulations can have a significant impact on the company's financial results, as evidenced by the impact of the OECD's Pillar II guidance (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The quick-service restaurant industry is characterized by a moderate level of capital intensity, with significant investments required for real estate, construction, and equipment. RBI's franchise model allows it to offload much of this capital burden to its franchisees, which enhances its return on invested capital. However, the company is still required to make strategic investments in its brands and technology to maintain its competitive position.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   RBI plans to invest up to USD 700 million through year-end 2028 in its "Reclaim the Flame" plan for Burger King, which includes high-quality remodels and technology upgrades (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   The company expects total capital expenditures and cash inducements to be in the USD 400 million to USD 450 million range for 2025 and 2026, stepping down to USD 350 million to USD 400 million in 2027 to 2028 (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 8, 2025).
*   The acquisition of Carrols Restaurant Group, Inc. and the subsequent refranchising strategy demonstrate the company's willingness to make significant capital investments to improve the quality of its system (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** RBI's revenue streams are highly visible and recurring, thanks to its long-term franchise agreements. These agreements typically require franchisees to pay a percentage of their sales as royalties, which provides a steady and predictable source of income for the company. The franchise model also insulates RBI from some of the volatility of the restaurant business, as its revenues are based on top-line sales rather than store-level profitability.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Franchise and property revenues of USD 663 million in Q1 2025 represent a significant and recurring source of income for the company (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   The company's over 90% franchised business model provides a high degree of revenue visibility and stability (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).
*   Long-term franchise agreements with over 32,000 restaurants provide a predictable and recurring revenue stream (Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025).

**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **Aggregation**
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(2 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0.36 + 0.45 + 0.45 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.08 = **2.74**

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 27.4 / 100

### **Mapping**
The weighted score of 27.4 falls within the 10-30 range, which corresponds to a moat rating of 1.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration of ~8–12 years is based on the strength of RBI's intangible assets (brands) and its efficient scale, which are the primary drivers of its competitive advantage. The company's well-established brands and extensive global footprint are difficult for competitors to replicate and should provide a durable advantage for at least the next decade. However, the moat is susceptible to erosion from shifting consumer preferences, increased competition from both traditional and non-traditional players, and the potential for a decline in franchisee relations.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Decline in Brand Relevance:** A failure to innovate and adapt to changing consumer tastes could lead to a decline in the relevance of RBI's brands, particularly Burger King, which has faced challenges in recent years.
2.  **Deterioration of Franchisee Relations:** A significant deterioration in the relationship between RBI and its franchisees could lead to a decline in operational execution, a slowdown in restaurant growth, and a weakening of the overall system.
3.  **Increased Competition:** The quick-service restaurant industry is intensely competitive, and the emergence of new, disruptive players or the resurgence of existing competitors could erode RBI's market share and profitability.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **System-wide sales growth:** A sustained decline in this metric would indicate a weakening of the company's brands and competitive position.
*   **Comparable sales:** This is a key indicator of the health of the company's existing restaurants and its ability to drive organic growth.
*   **Net restaurant growth:** A slowdown in unit expansion could signal a decline in the attractiveness of the company's franchise proposition.
*   **Franchisee profitability:** While not directly reported, this is a crucial metric for the long-term health of the franchise system.
*   **Digital mix:** An increasing digital mix would indicate that the company is successfully engaging with its customers through its digital channels and leveraging its data advantage.
*   **Brand health metrics:** Tracking brand awareness, consideration, and preference through consumer surveys and other market research can provide early warning signs of a decline in brand relevance.
*   **Advertising fund contributions:** A decline in franchisee contributions to the advertising fund could indicate a lack of confidence in the company's marketing strategy.
*   **Franchisee satisfaction surveys:** These can provide a direct measure of the health of the company's relationship with its franchisees.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Restaurant Brands International possesses a moderate moat, primarily derived from its portfolio of well-known brands and its extensive global scale. The company's franchise model provides a stable and predictable revenue stream, while its size confers significant cost advantages in purchasing and distribution. However, the moat is not unassailable. The company faces intense competition, and its success is heavily dependent on its ability to maintain the health and relevance of its brands, as well as positive relationships with its franchisees. A failure in either of these areas could lead to a significant erosion of its competitive advantage.
