### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum China operates in the largest restaurant market globally and is expanding its footprint with a target of 20,000 stores by 2026. The company is tracking over 800 cities that do not have a KFC and 1,400 cities that do not have a Pizza Hut, indicating significant geographic whitespace. System sales have grown consistently, and the company is actively developing new store formats and expanding its emerging brands like Lavazza to capture more of the market.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum China has a dedicated food innovation team and a 27,000-square-foot innovation center in Shanghai. In 2024, the company launched around 600 new or upgraded menu items across its brands. Management is also committed to digital innovation, with a digital R&D center and investments in AI to enhance customer experience and operational efficiency. The expansion of KCOFFEE Cafes and the Lavazza partnership demonstrate a commitment to developing new growth avenues beyond its core brands.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Yum China does not disclose R&D spending as a percentage of revenue in the traditional sense, its "R&D" is focused on menu innovation and digital capabilities. The launch of approximately 600 new or upgraded menu items in 2024 demonstrates a high velocity of product development. The company's digital R&D center supports an ecosystem where digital ordering accounted for about 90% of total sales in 2024, indicating effective investment in technology to drive sales.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum China's sales organization is its vast restaurant network and powerful digital ecosystem. As of December 31, 2024, its loyalty programs for KFC and Pizza Hut had a combined membership of over 525 million, with member sales accounting for approximately 65% of system sales. Digital sales exceeded $9 billion in 2024, and delivery contributed approximately 39% of company sales, showcasing a highly effective and modern sales and distribution network.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Yum China reported an operating profit margin of 10.3%, an increase from 10.1% in the prior year. The company's restaurant margin was 15.7% in 2024. These margins demonstrate solid profitability for a large-scale restaurant operator, especially considering wage inflation and investments in value promotions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing margin improvement through several initiatives. "Project Fresh Eye" and "Project Red Eye" were launched to enhance operational and supply chain efficiency by simplifying, centralizing, and automating key processes. The company is also leveraging its scale for procurement, using long-term bulk purchase agreements, and developing a vast logistics network to reduce costs. Furthermore, the increasing mix of franchise stores, which carry higher margins, is expected to contribute positively to profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum China employs over 350,000 people and emphasizes a "People First" philosophy. The company has been certified as a Top Employer in China for seven consecutive years and was ranked the second-best workplace in China in 2025. It offers equity incentives to its Restaurant General Managers (RGMs), with over 14,700 RGMs becoming stockholders, and reports a relatively low RGM turnover rate of 9.7% in 2024. These factors suggest strong labor relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a deep bench of experience within the company. Many executives, such as Warton Wang (General Manager, KFC) and Jeff Kuai (General Manager, Pizza Hut), have long tenures, having risen through the ranks. CEO Joey Wat has been with the company since 2014 and CEO since 2018, providing consistent leadership. There is no evidence of public discord or unusual turnover at the executive level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum China's public disclosures list a nine-person executive team beyond the CEO, covering key functions like operations for each major brand (KFC, Pizza Hut), supply chain, technology, legal, and finance. The company's well-known "Bench Planning" career development path is designed to cultivate leaders from within, ensuring a pipeline of talent for key operational roles. The promotion of long-serving internal candidates to top roles, like the General Managers of KFC and Pizza Hut, is strong evidence of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes an audit report attesting to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The filing provides detailed segment reporting for KFC and Pizza Hut, including breakdowns of restaurant-level expenses. There is no history of material weaknesses or significant restatements mentioned, suggesting robust accounting controls. Management's discussion of initiatives like "Project Red Eye" to optimize procurement further points to a focus on detailed cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum China's competitive advantages are its scale, localized supply chain, and digital ecosystem. The company operates 33 logistics centers with plans to expand to 45-50, enabling it to serve over 2,200 cities and penetrate lower-tier markets where competitors struggle. Its loyalty program membership (over 525 million) is a massive, proprietary dataset that informs menu innovation and marketing in a way that is difficult for rivals to replicate. This combination of physical logistics and digital reach provides a significant moat.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy is explicitly focused on long-term growth, as evidenced by its goal to reach 20,000 stores by 2026 and its continued investments in digitalization, supply chain, and new brands like Lavazza. The company consistently reinvests in its business, with over 70% of KFC and Pizza Hut stores remodeled or built in the past five years. While the company provides value offerings which can impact short-term margins, these are framed as necessary to drive traffic and long-term market share.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum China has a strong balance sheet and has been actively returning capital to shareholders, not raising it. The company announced plans to return $4.5 billion to shareholders between 2024 and 2026 through dividends and share buybacks. In the fourth quarter of 2024 alone, it repurchased $1.242 billion of its common stock. These actions, funded by cash on hand and operating cash flow, indicate a strong financial position with no foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Review of recent earnings call transcripts reveals that management openly discusses challenges. For example, they have addressed issues such as the impact of COVID-19, shifts in consumer spending, and the competitive landscape, including the need for increased value offerings which pressures margins. The company's investor relations website provides a comprehensive repository of financial reports, presentations, and transcripts, suggesting a commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided SEC filings or from a review of recent transcripts of significant legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions that raise red flags, or governance concerns. The 2024 10-K notes the company is subject to various lawsuits from time to time but states that ultimate liability is not likely to have a material adverse effect. The company has a code of conduct and appears to be in good standing with regulators.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1673358/000095017025029134/yumc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/YUMC/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/YUMC/transcripts/) (2025)

**Synthesis**

Yum China scores positively across all of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting its dominant market position, strong operational execution, and clear growth strategy. The company's primary strengths lie in its massive scale, robust and localized supply chain, and a powerful digital ecosystem that fosters customer loyalty and provides a wealth of data for decision-making. Management appears stable, deep, and shareholder-friendly, with a clear focus on long-term growth through both organic expansion and the development of new concepts.

The score is most likely to be influenced in the next 12-24 months by the pace of new store openings toward the 20,000-store goal and the success of margin improvement initiatives like "Project Red Eye" and "Fresh Eye." A significant slowdown in the Chinese economy that impacts consumer discretionary spending could pressure same-store sales and challenge the "Long Runway" thesis. Evidence of a sustained decline in restaurant-level margins despite efficiency programs or a material setback in the expansion of emerging brands like Lavazza would be the most likely factors to flip a "Yes" to a "No".
