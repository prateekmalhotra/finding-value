### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has an active share repurchase program and bought back 2.6 million shares for $141.4 million in Q1 2025. Continued execution of the remaining authorization will reduce the number of shares outstanding and increase earnings per share.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the denominator in the EPS calculation, directly increasing EPS. This can lead to a higher stock price, assuming a constant P/E multiple.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with potential for acceleration depending on market conditions and cash flow generation. The current authorization has no expiration date.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Minimal repurchases, only to offset dilution from stock-based compensation.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Continued repurchases at a pace similar to Q1 2025, utilizing a significant portion of the remaining authorization.
    *   **High Scenario:** Aggressive repurchases, potentially through an accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program, exhausting the current authorization.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20% (Medium) - Based on the potential for significant EPS accretion.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80% - The company has a history of executing on its repurchase authorizations and has demonstrated a willingness to be opportunistic.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a favorable stock price.

    *   Daily trading volume and price of CAKE stock.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business could reduce cash available for repurchases.
    *   The stock price could rise to a level where management no longer views repurchases as an attractive use of capital.

*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch - Monitor the pace of repurchases each quarter as a sign of management's confidence and capital allocation strategy.

**2. Catalyst Title:** New Restaurant Openings and Growth

*   **Timing:** Throughout 2025, with a target of up to 25 new units for the full year.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Fewer than 20 new units opened due to construction or permitting delays.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 22-25 new units opened, in line with guidance.
    *   **High Scenario:** Over 25 new units opened, with strong initial performance.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-15% (Medium) - Based on the direct contribution to revenue and earnings growth.

*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch - Track the number and performance of new restaurant openings as a key indicator of the company's growth trajectory.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Margin Expansion and Profitability

*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is focused on driving margin expansion through improved operational efficiencies and cost management. Management has guided to an adjusted net income margin of 4.75% for 2025.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program Execution:**
*   **Formula:** Share Price = (EPS * P/E Ratio)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Shares Outstanding: 49.5 million (SEC Filing, May 5, 2025)
    *   Net Income: $160 million (based on company guidance)
    *   P/E Ratio: 15x
*   **Base Case (No Repurchase):** EPS = $160m / 49.5m = $3.23. Share Price = $3.23 * 15 = $48.45
*   **Catalyst Scenario (2.6m Share Repurchase):** New Shares Outstanding = 46.9m. New EPS = $160m / 46.9m = $3.41. New Share Price = $3.41 * 15 = $51.15 (+5.6%)

**2. Margin Expansion and Profitability:**
*   **Formula:** Share Price = (Revenue * Net Margin / Shares Outstanding) * P/E Ratio
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Revenue: $3.76 billion (Investing.com, Apr 30, 2025)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 49.5 million
    *   P/E Ratio: 15x
*   **Base Case (4.5% Net Margin):** Net Income = $3.76b * 4.5% = $169.2m. EPS = $169.2m / 49.5m = $3.42. Share Price = $3.42 * 15 = $51.30
*   **Catalyst Scenario (4.75% Net Margin):** Net Income = $3.76b * 4.75% = $178.6m. EPS = $178.6m / 49.5m = $3.61. Share Price = $3.61 * 15 = $54.15 (+5.5%)

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for CAKE appear to be net positive. The company's commitment to shareholder returns through a significant share repurchase program, coupled with steady unit growth and a focus on margin expansion, provides a clear path to EPS growth in the coming year.
