### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

   - **Type:** Financial
   - **Description (1–2 sentences):** The U.S. segment continues to demonstrate strong growth, with a 17% increase in revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2025. The catalyst is the continued expansion into new states and achieving profitability in existing markets, driving significant top-line and bottom-line growth.
   - **Mechanism:** As new states legalize online sports betting and iGaming, Flutter's FanDuel brand is well-positioned to capture a significant market share. Increased revenue and profitability in the U.S. will directly translate to higher earnings per share and a re-rating of the stock's valuation multiple.
   - **Timing:** Ongoing, with key milestones tied to state legislative calendars over the next 12 months.
   - **Quantification:**
      - Low Scenario: 15% YoY U.S. revenue growth.
      - Base Scenario: 20% YoY U.S. revenue growth, consistent with recent performance.
      - High Scenario: 25%+ YoY U.S. revenue growth, driven by new state legalizations and strong customer acquisition.
   - **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%)
   - **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%
   - **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued legalization of online sports betting and iGaming in key states.

   - **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
      - Slower-than-expected state-level legalization.
      - Increased competition leading to margin pressure.
      - Unfavorable changes in tax laws in key states.
   - **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy

**2. Catalyst Title:** Successful Integration of Acquisitions (Snai and NSX)
   - **Type:** M&A
   - **Description (1–2 sentences):** Flutter completed the acquisitions of Snai (Italy) and NSX (Brazil) in the second quarter of 2025. The successful integration of these businesses will expand Flutter's international footprint and provide new revenue streams.
   - **Mechanism:** The acquisitions diversify Flutter's revenue base and provide access to high-growth markets in Italy and Brazil. A smooth integration, realizing cost and revenue synergies, will boost overall earnings and demonstrate management's ability to execute on its M&A strategy.
   - **Timing:** Integration efforts are ongoing, with key financial impacts expected to materialize over the next 12-24 months.
   - **Quantification:**
      - Low Scenario: Minimal revenue contribution and integration challenges.
      - Base Scenario: Successful integration with a 10% increase in international revenue.
      - High Scenario: Strong synergy realization, leading to a 15%+ increase in international revenue.
   - **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%)

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program
   - **Type:** Corporate Action
   - **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a $5 billion share repurchase program in place, which is expected to be deployed over the next three to four years. This signals management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects and will return capital to shareholders.
   - **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, all else being equal, should lead to a higher stock price. The program also provides a floor for the stock price during periods of market volatility.
   - **Timing:** 0-36 months.
   - **Quantification:**
      - Low Scenario: Slow deployment of the repurchase program.

   - **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%)
   - **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%
   - **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's ability to generate sufficient free cash flow to fund the repurchases.
   - **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
      - Quarterly reports on the number of shares repurchased.
      - Free cash flow generation.
      - Management commentary on capital allocation.
   - **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
      - A significant downturn in business performance, reducing the capacity for repurchases.
      - The stock price appreciating to a level where buybacks are no longer accretive.
   - **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy

### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. U.S. Market Growth Catalyst:**
   - **Formula:** Increase in U.S. segment Adjusted EBITDA x Peer Valuation Multiple
   - **Assumptions:** Current U.S. Adjusted EBITDA of $561 million for H1 2025. Peer valuation multiple of 15x EV/EBITDA.
   - **Calculation:** A 20% increase in U.S. Adjusted EBITDA would result in an additional $112.2 million in EBITDA. At a 15x multiple, this translates to a $1.68 billion increase in enterprise value, or a ~4% increase in the current market cap.

**2. Share Repurchase Program Catalyst:**
   - **Formula:** (Total Repurchase Amount / Current Market Cap) x 100
   - **Assumptions:** $5 billion repurchase program. Current market cap of ~$40 billion.
   - **Calculation:** A $5 billion repurchase program represents approximately 12.5% of the current market capitalization, which could lead to a proportional increase in the stock price over the life of the program, all else being equal.

### **Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for Flutter Entertainment plc is positive. The strong growth in the U.S. market, coupled with the potential for successful integration of recent acquisitions, provides a clear path for revenue and earnings growth in the next 0-12 months. While there are risks related to regulation and competition, the company's market-leading position and strategic initiatives suggest a positive short-term market signal.
