I have a good starting point with the investor relations links. Now, I will proceed to browse the provided SEC filings and the transcript link to conduct a thorough analysis based on Fisher's 15 points.Olin Corporation, August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Olin Corporation 2024 Form 10-K filed on February 20, 2025, and various earnings call transcripts from 2022 to 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls are fundamental to thousands of products, including vinyls, urethanes, and water treatment chemicals, ensuring broad, continued demand. The company is a leading global producer in this segment, which represented 55% of 2024 sales. The Winchester segment, a premier U.S. ammunition manufacturer, has secured multiple long-term contracts with the U.S. military, including a five-year contract awarded in 2022 for handgun ammunition and a 2024 contract to construct a new ammunition manufacturing facility. The Epoxy segment serves diverse applications focused on sustainability, such as wind energy and electrical laminates.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin is actively investing in growth projects. In 2023, the company formed "Hidrogenii," a joint venture with Plug Power Inc. to build a 15-ton-per-day hydrogen liquefaction plant, capitalizing on the growing hydrogen economy. In early 2025, Olin announced an agreement to acquire AMMO, Inc.'s small-caliber ammunition manufacturing assets to expand its Winchester business. The Winchester segment also continues to innovate, receiving the "Ammunition Product of the Year" award in 2025 from American Rifleman and American Hunter magazines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's R&D expenditures were $18.4 million in 2024, a decrease from $20.0 million in 2023 and $18.3 million in 2022. These figures are relatively small compared to their sales of $6.54 billion in 2024. While the Winchester segment consistently develops award-winning new products, the overall R&D spending as a percentage of revenue is low for a manufacturing company of its scale.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin markets its products through a direct sales force and to a diverse customer base, including industrial customers, mass merchants, and the U.S. Government. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of sales in 2024, indicating a well-diversified sales effort. The company's joint venture with Mitsui & Co., Ltd., Blue Water Alliance (BWA), leverages Mitsui's global logistics and customer relationships to enhance Olin's North American export capability and global terminal network.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's gross margin was 11% in 2024, a significant decrease from 17% in 2023 and 23% in 2022. This decline was driven by lower pricing in the Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls and Epoxy segments, and higher costs in the Winchester segment. The Epoxy segment even reported a loss of $85.0 million in 2024, highlighting the cyclical pressures on profitability. While historical performance shows potential for higher margins, the recent trend is concerning.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin is actively restructuring to improve profitability. The company has a "value first operating model" to "preserve and enhance value from the entire ECU." This includes reconfiguring its global Epoxy asset footprint to optimize productive assets, which has led to restructuring charges. In December 2024, Olin announced the permanent closure of its Chlorine 3 manufacturing facility in Freeport, TX, to further streamline operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Olin had 7,676 employees, with various labor unions representing a significant number of hourly-paid employees. In 2025, only two labor agreements in the U.S. are set to expire, representing approximately 2% of the global workforce. Olin emphasizes its "Lifting People" core principles to create a supportive and empowering work environment and highlights increased employee volunteerism and a successful employee referral program, with 49% of hires in 2024 coming from referrals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information in the provided documents to suggest either poor or outstanding executive relations. The 2024 10-K does not mention any significant executive turnover or disputes. The proxy statement, which would contain more detailed information on executive compensation and board structure, was not among the provided documents.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** No evidence found in the provided documents.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's 2024 10-K lists its executive officers, indicating a team with experience in various aspects of the business. However, there is no detailed information on succession planning or the management bench beyond the named executive officers in the provided documents. The transcript links provide access to earnings calls, where various executives speak, but this does not offer a comprehensive view of management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** No definitive evidence found in the provided documents.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's 2024 10-K includes a report from their independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, which states that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down sales and income by its three main business units. There is no mention of any material weaknesses or restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's vertical integration is a key competitive advantage. The company is one of the largest fully integrated global producers of epoxy resins and benefits from low-cost feedstocks from its Chlor Alkali segment. The co-production of chlorine and caustic soda, referred to as an Electrochemical Unit (ECU), allows Olin to optimize its production and sales based on the demand for either product, a unique feature of the chlor-alkali industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](httpshttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's management has demonstrated a willingness to undertake significant restructuring, such as the reconfiguration of its Epoxy business and the closure of a chlor alkali facility, to optimize for long-term value. These actions have resulted in short-term restructuring charges but are aimed at improving long-term profitability. The joint venture in hydrogen production also points to a long-range strategic vision.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin has a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company has a $1.3 billion share repurchase program authorized in December 2024. In 2024, the company repurchased $300.3 million of its common stock. This indicates a financial position that does not necessitate dilutive equity financing for its current growth plans.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's earnings call transcripts show a willingness to discuss challenges. For example, in the face of declining Epoxy segment performance, the company openly discusses the impact of low-priced imports from Asia. Management also clearly articulated the negative financial impact of Hurricane Beryl on their operations in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/) (2022-2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K and recent transcripts do not reveal any significant legal or regulatory issues that would question the integrity of the management. The company has been in business since 1892, suggesting a long history of stable operations. There are no mentions of related-party transactions, audit issues, or governance red flags in the provided documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

Synthesis:
Olin Corporation scores well on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term strategic positioning, financial strength, and transparency with investors. The company's vertically integrated business model and its commitment to restructuring for long-term value are significant positives. However, the score is brought down by declining profit margins and a lack of clear evidence on R&D effectiveness and management depth. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the Epoxy segment restructuring in restoring profitability and the performance of the new hydrogen joint venture. A sustained improvement in gross margins and more detailed disclosures on R&D pipeline and succession planning would be key evidence to turn the "No" answers to "Yes".

fisher score is 11 / 15
