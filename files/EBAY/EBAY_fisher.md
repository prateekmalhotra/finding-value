**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's marketplace model has global brand recognition. The company's growth strategy focuses on "focus categories" like motors, parts & accessories, luxury goods, and collectibles, which have a large total addressable market. However, Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) has been stagnant, with a 2% increase in the first quarter of 2025 on an as-reported basis and a 1% increase on an FX-Neutral basis, as stated in the Q1 2025 earnings call on May 7, 2025. This suggests that while the market potential exists, eBay is struggling to capture it at a rate that indicates a "sizable increase in sales." The company's revenue growth is modest, with a 3% increase on an as-reported basis and a 2% increase on an FX-Neutral basis in Q1 2025.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's management is focused on enhancing the customer experience through technology, as mentioned in their first-quarter 2025 earnings call on May 7, 2025. They are investing in AI-powered tools like the "magical listing tool" to simplify the selling process and are also focused on improving the buying experience with new features in focus categories. However, these are incremental improvements rather than transformative new product lines. The company's recent strategy has been more about refining the core marketplace than expanding into new ventures that will significantly increase total sales potential.
**Answer:** No

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's "Product development" expenses were $427 million in the three months ending March 31, 2025, which is a significant investment. This represents approximately 16.6% of the company's net revenues for the same period. While this is a substantial investment, the effectiveness is questionable given the low single-digit growth in GMV and revenue. The company is launching new features, but they are not translating into significant market share gains or accelerated growth compared to competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000061/ebay-20250331.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a marketplace, eBay's "sales" are generated through the success of its sellers. The company's sales and marketing expenses were $574 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025. The company is focused on driving seller success through tools and features, but the modest GMV growth indicates that the overall sales ecosystem is not performing at an "above-average" level compared to the broader e-commerce market. The number of active buyers remained flat at 132 million in the first quarter of 2025.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay has strong profit margins. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company reported a GAAP operating margin of 22.3% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 27.6%. These are healthy margins for a mature technology company and indicate a strong underlying business model. The company's ability to generate significant cash flow is a testament to its profitable business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000061/ebay-20250331.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay is focused on cost discipline to maintain its profit margins. The company has been optimizing its marketing spend and has undertaken workforce reductions to improve efficiency. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, the company highlighted its disciplined approach to cost management, which has enabled it to maintain strong profitability even with modest revenue growth. The company's focus on higher-margin "focus categories" also contributes to margin stability.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no widespread public information to suggest major issues with labor and personnel relations at eBay. The company regularly appears on "best places to work" lists and offers competitive benefits. However, like many tech companies, eBay has conducted layoffs, announcing a reduction of its workforce in early 2025. While this is a negative for the affected employees, it is not necessarily indicative of poor overall labor relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at eBay has been relatively stable in recent years. Jamie Iannone has been CEO since 2020. There are no public reports of significant infighting or disagreements among the executive team. The company's proxy statements show a clear and consistent leadership structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay has a deep bench of experienced executives leading its various business units and functions. The company's investor relations website and annual reports list a number of seasoned executives beyond the CEO and CFO, which suggests a good distribution of leadership and expertise across the organization. This reduces key-person risk and indicates a commitment to succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, publicly traded company, eBay is subject to stringent accounting and auditing standards. The company's 10-K and 10-Q filings are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a reputable accounting firm, and have not revealed any material weaknesses in internal controls. The company provides detailed segment and geographic revenue breakdowns, indicating a sophisticated cost analysis and accounting system.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive clue in the e-commerce industry is the "take rate," or the percentage of GMV that the marketplace keeps as revenue. eBay's take rate is strong and has been increasing, which shows the value it provides to sellers. Another key aspect is the network effect, where more buyers attract more sellers, and vice versa. While eBay has a large network, the stagnant user growth suggests its network effects are not as powerful as they once were, especially when compared to rivals like Amazon.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000061/ebay-20250331.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's management team appears to be focused on maintaining near-term profitability, as evidenced by their emphasis on cost discipline and operating margins. While they are investing in technology and product development, the level of investment does not suggest a willingness to sacrifice significant near-term profits for long-term growth. The company's guidance and capital allocation strategy, which includes significant share buybacks, prioritize shareholder returns in the short- to medium-term over aggressive, long-term growth investments.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/EBAY/transcripts/']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay has a strong balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $4.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks rather than issuing new shares. In the first quarter of 2025, eBay repurchased $648 million of its common stock. This indicates that there is a very low risk of equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000061/ebay-20250331.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's management team regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor presentations, and SEC filings. They are generally transparent about the company's performance and provide detailed financial information and KPIs. The company openly discusses challenges and the steps they are taking to address them. For example, they have been upfront about the challenges of stimulating GMV growth in a competitive e-commerce landscape.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/EBAY/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no major red flags concerning the integrity of eBay's management team. The company has a code of conduct, and there have been no recent, significant scandals or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of the leadership. The company's financial reporting is transparent, and there are no signs of major governance issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm']

---
**Synthesis:**
eBay scores well on factors related to financial strength, profitability, and management stability. The company has strong profit margins, a solid balance sheet, and a seasoned management team with a good track record of transparency and integrity. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses in the company's growth prospects. Stagnant user and GMV growth, coupled with an R&D and sales strategy that has yet to produce a significant acceleration in growth, are major concerns. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are a sustained re-acceleration of GMV growth in focus categories and evidence that the company's technology investments are leading to market share gains. To turn the "No" answers to "Yes," we would need to see a clear and sustained trend of above-market growth, the successful launch of new products or services that expand the company's total addressable market, and a more aggressive long-term investment strategy.
