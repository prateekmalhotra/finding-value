Employers Holdings, Inc., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, earnings call transcripts, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Employers Holdings, Inc. (EIG) is a specialty provider of workers' compensation insurance, a product with demand tied to overall employment and payroll growth. The company has demonstrated consistent growth in its core market, with in-force policies increasing to 130,767 at year-end 2024 from 121,356 at year-end 2022. EIG is also expanding its addressable market by selectively entering new industries like landscaping and janitorial services, which has contributed to growth in higher hazard groups (D-G). The company's focus on small to mid-sized businesses and its expanding distribution channels, including digital partnerships, provide avenues for sustained growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG demonstrates a commitment to ongoing development through its investments in technology and expansion of its business appetite. The company continues to invest in technology to automate business processes and enhance data and analytics capabilities, aiming to reduce long-term operating costs and improve competitiveness. In 2024, EIG implemented a new digital first notice of loss tool and an enhanced payment processing system. Furthermore, the company has been actively expanding into new industries and classes of business since 2021, indicating a clear strategy to grow beyond its traditional markets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For an insurance carrier, R&D is analogous to investments in technology, data analytics, and process improvements. EIG has shown effectiveness in this area by developing proprietary application programming interfaces (APIs) for its digital distribution channel, which has grown to represent 7.0% of in-force premiums as of December 31, 2024, up from 4.5% in 2022. The company's Cerity brand, a direct-to-customer digital solution, further demonstrates its commitment to innovation in distribution and customer experience. These initiatives are significant for a company of EIG's size and specialization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG utilizes a multi-channel distribution strategy that includes traditional independent agents, specialty agents, and direct-to-customer channels. The company has approximately 2,500 traditional insurance agencies and has developed strong relationships with specialty partners like ADP, which generated 17.2% of in-force premiums in 2024. The growth in digital channels and the ability to attract and retain a diverse range of distribution partners suggest an effective and adaptable sales organization. The increase in new business premiums from $167.7 million in 2022 to $227.5 million in 2024 is further evidence of a strong sales effort.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG's profitability is best measured by its combined ratio, which has been consistently below 100%, indicating underwriting profitability. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, the combined ratios were 97.9%, 95.0%, and 96.9%, respectively. While these margins are worthwhile, they have been subject to some variability, and the 2024 ratio is higher than the preceding years. The company's ability to maintain underwriting profitability in a competitive market is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG is focused on several initiatives to maintain or improve profit margins. These include disciplined underwriting, leveraging data analytics for better risk selection and pricing, and investing in technology to reduce operating costs. The consolidation of its direct-to-consumer operations (Cerity) into its mainstream operations in late 2023 was a specific action taken to operate more efficiently and generate cost savings. Furthermore, the company's focus on claims and medical case management, including the use of an outcomes-based medical network, is designed to control loss costs and improve margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG emphasizes its commitment to being an employer of choice with a focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion. As of December 31, 2024, women represented 64% of all employees, 72% of managers and supervisors, and 71% of the executive team. The company has a comprehensive Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and provides equal employment opportunities. While these are positive indicators, there is no specific, verifiable data on employee turnover or engagement metrics in the provided documents to definitively assess if relations are "outstanding" compared to peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The information available in the 10-K provides details on the executive team and board of directors, but does not offer specific insights into the quality of executive relations, such as the level of internal harmony or discord. Without access to more qualitative information or reports on executive turnover and board dynamics, it is difficult to assess this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided 10-K lists the executive officers and their backgrounds, indicating an experienced leadership team. However, the filings do not provide sufficient detail on succession planning or the depth of management below the executive level to make a definitive judgment on this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG's 10-K report for the year ended December 31, 2024, includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, on the company's internal control over financial reporting. Management's annual report on internal control over financial reporting also concludes that these controls were effective. This provides strong evidence of good cost analysis and accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG's specialization in workers' compensation for small to mid-sized businesses is a key differentiator. The company's disciplined underwriting approach, which focuses on selecting lower-risk businesses within various industry classes, has allowed it to maintain profitability. The development of alternative distribution channels, particularly digital platforms and partnerships with companies like ADP, gives EIG a competitive edge in reaching its target market efficiently.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG's strategy of investing in technology and expanding into new markets suggests a long-range outlook. These investments may impact short-term expenses but are aimed at building a more competitive and scalable business for the future. The company's consistent return of capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks also indicates confidence in its long-term financial stability. However, there is no explicit statement in the provided materials about a willingness to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term growth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EIG has a strong capital position and has been actively returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases, not issuing new shares. In the three years ending December 31, 2024, the company repurchased $149.2 million of its common stock. As of December 31, 2024, the company had a remaining share repurchase authorization of $29.7 million. This demonstrates that the company has sufficient financial resources to fund its operations and growth initiatives without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The availability of quarterly earnings call transcripts provides a good degree of transparency. In these calls, management discusses both positive and negative aspects of the company's performance, such as the drivers of premium growth and the reasons for changes in the combined ratio. However, without a specific instance of a significant negative event to evaluate, it is difficult to fully assess management's candor during times of trouble.
**Answer:** No

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 10-K filing for the year ended December 31, 2024, does not disclose any material legal proceedings, regulatory actions, or related-party transactions that would raise questions about management's integrity. The company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees and the Board of Directors. While this is a positive sign, a definitive assessment of "unquestionable integrity" is difficult without more extensive research into the backgrounds and reputations of the individual executives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1379041/000137904125000049/eig-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**Synthesis:**
Employers Holdings, Inc. scores well on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its core business strategy, financial strength, and market position. The company's focused approach on a niche market, combined with disciplined underwriting and investments in technology, provides a solid foundation for profitable growth. The strong financial position, evidenced by consistent share buybacks and a clean bill of health on its accounting controls, is a significant positive. The primary areas of weakness in this analysis stem from a lack of publicly available information on qualitative aspects such as executive relations, management depth, and labor relations. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with more disclosure on these fronts. A sustained improvement in the combined ratio, driven by the company's margin enhancement initiatives, would also strengthen the case for EIG as a top-tier investment according to Fisher's principles. Conversely, a significant increase in the combined ratio or a failure to continue growing its policy base could negatively impact the score.

**fisher score is 9 / 15**
