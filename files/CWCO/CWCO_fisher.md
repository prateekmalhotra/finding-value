Company, August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. 2024 10-K, Q1-Q2 2025 10-Q, and Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Consolidated Water's core business of designing, building, and operating desalination plants and water distribution systems is situated in regions suffering from water scarcity, a durable and growing problem. The company's 2024 10-K notes that climate change, population growth, and tourism are increasing demand for reliable freshwater supplies in its service areas like the Cayman Islands and Hawaii. A key piece of evidence for future growth is the multi-year contract to construct and operate a desalination plant for the Water Authority of the Cayman Islands, as detailed in their May 7, 2025, earnings call. This, combined with their ongoing projects and the fundamental, non-cyclical demand for water, suggests a long runway for sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing growth through new projects and potential acquisitions. In their Q1 2025 earnings call on May 7, 2025, CEO Rick McTaggart stated they are "actively pursuing other new project opportunities in the Caribbean and elsewhere" and are also evaluating "potential acquisitions of water-related businesses." This indicates a clear commitment to expanding their revenue streams beyond their existing operational footprint. The company's capital expenditures, as detailed in their quarterly filings, are primarily directed towards developing new water infrastructure projects, which directly supports this growth strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Consolidated Water is a project development and operations company, not a technology or manufacturing firm, so traditional R&D is not a core part of its business model. The company's financial statements do not show any line items for research and development expenses. Instead, their innovation is focused on adopting and efficiently implementing the most advanced, proven desalination and water treatment technologies available from third-party suppliers. Therefore, evaluating them on traditional R&D metrics would be inappropriate.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "sales" process is more akin to a business development function focused on winning long-term government and utility contracts rather than traditional product sales. Their success is demonstrated by their ability to win and renew exclusive, multi-decade licenses and contracts with governments in their core markets, such as the Cayman Islands. The recent contract win for the new Red Gate desalination plant in Grand Cayman, as discussed in their quarterly reports, is a prime example of their effectiveness in this area. This indicates a highly effective, albeit specialized, sales and business development capability.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the three months ended June 30, 2025, the company reported a gross profit of $20.2 million on $45.6 million of revenue, representing a gross margin of 44%. This is a strong margin for a utility-like business and reflects the favorable terms of their long-term contracts and their operational efficiency. Their operating income for the same period was approximately $11.2 million, indicating a healthy operating margin as well. These margins have been consistently strong, as shown in their historical financial statements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025011063/cwco-20250630x10q.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on several levers to maintain and improve margins. As stated in their 2024 10-K, a key element is the ability to pass through a majority of their operating costs, including energy, to customers via their contracts, which protects margins from volatility. Additionally, the company is focused on improving the efficiency of its desalination plants, which can lower operating costs and boost profitability. In their earnings calls, management has discussed how they are leveraging their engineering expertise to design and build more efficient plants, which will improve long-term margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant labor issues or disputes in the company's recent SEC filings. The 2024 10-K reports that as of February 2, 2025, the company and its subsidiaries had 409 employees, and it does not mention any collective bargaining agreements or recent labor strife. While the filings do not provide detailed metrics on employee satisfaction or turnover, the absence of any disclosed labor-related problems is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company appears to have a stable and experienced executive team. The CEO, Frederick McTaggart, has been with the company for a long time, which suggests a consistent strategy and vision. The board of directors is composed of a mix of insiders and independent directors. There are no disclosures in their recent filings that would indicate any turmoil or significant disagreements at the executive or board level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the CEO, Consolidated Water has a team of experienced executives leading its key business segments. The company's filings name a Chief Financial Officer and other key officers. The operational management of their various subsidiaries is handled by local teams with deep expertise in their respective markets. While succession planning is not explicitly detailed, the long tenure of the senior team and the decentralized operational structure suggest a good degree of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, and they have consistently received unqualified audit opinions. Their segment reporting provides a good level of detail into the performance of their different business lines. There is no history of significant restatements or disclosures of material weaknesses in internal controls. This suggests that their cost analysis and accounting controls are robust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in this industry is the exclusive, long-term nature of government contracts and licenses. Consolidated Water has a strong track record of winning and renewing these contracts, which creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors. Their deep, long-standing relationships with the governments and utilities in their service territories provide them with an incumbent advantage that is difficult to replicate. This is a crucial factor that makes them an outstanding operator in their niche.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's entire business model is based on a long-range outlook. They invest significant capital in building large-scale infrastructure projects that have a useful life of several decades and generate predictable, long-term cash flows. Their willingness to undertake these multi-year projects demonstrates a focus on durable, long-term profitability over short-term gains. Management's discussion of their project pipeline in their earnings calls consistently emphasizes the long-term, recurring revenue streams these projects will generate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CWCO/transcripts/']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, the company had $46.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital of $91.3 million. They have very little long-term debt. Their strong balance sheet and consistent cash flow from operations provide them with ample financial flexibility to fund their current pipeline of growth projects without needing to issue a significant amount of new equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025011063/cwco-20250630x10q.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a regular dialogue with investors through quarterly earnings calls and participation in industry conferences. In their calls, they provide a balanced overview of the business, discussing both their successes and any challenges they may be facing, such as delays in project timelines or changes in regulatory environments. Their public disclosures are timely and transparent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CWCO/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of any material legal or regulatory actions against the company or its management related to issues of integrity. A review of their recent SEC filings, including the section on legal proceedings, reveals no red flags. The company has a code of conduct in place, and there are no disclosed instances of significant related-party transactions that would suggest any self-dealing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm']

Synthesis:
Consolidated Water scores highly on the Fisher checklist, with its strengths rooted in a strong, defensible market position in regions with persistent water scarcity. The company's business model, based on long-term, exclusive contracts, provides a durable competitive advantage and generates predictable cash flows and high profit margins. The primary negative is the lack of traditional R&D, which is a natural consequence of its business model. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the successful execution of its project backlog, particularly the new Red Gate plant in Grand Cayman, and its ability to win new large-scale projects in other territories. A "No" on R&D effectiveness is unlikely to change, as it is not central to their strategy, but continued success in winning new contracts would further solidify the "Yes" on its above-average sales organization.

fisher score is 14 / 15
