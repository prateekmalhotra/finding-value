Upbound Group, Inc. (UPBD), analysis date August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024.

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upbound Group serves a large and underserved market of subprime consumers, which comprised approximately 25% of the U.S. population as of October 29, 2024. The company is expanding its reach through its Acima segment by increasing partnerships with third-party retailers and growing its direct-to-consumer channels. The recent acquisition of Brigit in January 2025 diversifies the company's offerings into financial health technology, further expanding its total addressable market.

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upbound Group's acquisition of Brigit, a financial health technology company, demonstrates a commitment to expanding beyond its core lease-to-own business. The company's stated strategy includes upgrading and integrating technology platforms and pursuing joint ventures, partnerships, or mergers and acquisitions to advance its key initiatives. This indicates a forward-looking approach to growth and development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upbound Group does not disclose specific R&D expenditures, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these efforts relative to its size or peers. While the company's strategy emphasizes technology and innovation, with mentions of "internally developed software," the lack of quantifiable data on R&D investment and output metrics prevents a definitive positive assessment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Acima segment's revenue grew by 17.1% in 2024, driven by an increase in third-party retailer locations and productivity. This suggests a strong and effective sales organization capable of building and expanding partnerships. The company's focus on an omni-channel experience for its Rent-A-Center brand and its expansion into direct-to-consumer channels further support this conclusion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Upbound Group reported a gross profit margin of 48.1% and an operating profit margin of 6.7%. While gross margins are substantial, the operating margin is relatively thin, indicating high operating expenses relative to revenues. Without a direct comparison to industry peers, it is difficult to definitively assess whether these margins are "worthwhile."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upbound Group's strategy includes the development of "centers of excellence that will be leveraged across the organization to support our various business segments, utilizing best practices to drive efficiency and growth." The company also acknowledges in its risk factors that "failure to effectively manage our costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability," indicating a focus on cost management. These actions are aimed at improving operational efficiency and, by extension, profit margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K provides standard language about the importance of its employees. However, it does not provide any concrete evidence of *outstanding* labor relations, such as employee turnover rates, satisfaction surveys, or industry awards. Without such evidence, it is not possible to confirm that the company's labor and personnel relations are outstanding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has an orderly CEO succession plan in place, with the CFO being promoted to the role upon the CEO's retirement after a 40-year tenure. This suggests a degree of stability and planning. However, the concurrent departure of the Chief Technology and Digital Officer raises some questions about executive stability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250220364991/en/Upbound-Group-Announces-CEO-Transition (February 20, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The promotion of the CFO to CEO suggests a degree of management depth and a commitment to promoting from within. The 10-K also states that "regional and district managers generally have long tenures with us." However, the departure of the CTDO, a key role in a technology-focused company, without a named successor, indicates a potential lack of depth in a critical area.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K includes a "Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting," which concludes that the company's internal controls were effective as of December 31, 2024. This assessment is supported by an unqualified opinion from its independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP. This provides strong evidence of robust accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upbound Group's key competitive advantages lie in its omni-channel strategy, its growing network of retail partners in the Acima segment, and its proprietary decisioning algorithms. The recent acquisition of Brigit also provides a unique offering in the financial health space for underserved consumers, potentially creating a competitive moat. The company's ability to integrate these different channels and services will be a key determinant of its long-term success.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategic investments in technology and the acquisition of Brigit, a financial health technology company, indicate a long-range outlook. These initiatives are designed to build a more comprehensive and defensible business model, even if they require significant upfront investment and may not generate immediate profits. This suggests a willingness to prioritize long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upbound Group generated $104.7 million in cash from operations in 2024 and has access to a revolving credit facility. The company also has a share repurchase program in place, which reduces the number of outstanding shares. While the company has a significant amount of debt, its cash flow and borrowing capacity appear sufficient to fund its operations and growth initiatives without resorting to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K includes a comprehensive "Risk Factors" section that details a wide range of potential challenges, from macroeconomic headwinds to regulatory scrutiny. The "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section also provides a balanced view of the company's performance. This level of disclosure suggests a commitment to transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upbound Group is facing several legal and regulatory challenges, including investigations by the CFPB and a multi-state attorneys' general group into the business practices of its Acima subsidiary. Additionally, Brigit, which Upbound acquired, had previously settled with the FTC. These issues, while not definitive proof of wrongdoing, raise significant questions about the company's compliance and business practices, and prevent a "Yes" answer for this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/933036/000093303625000042/upbd-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)

---
Synthesis:
Upbound Group exhibits strengths in its large addressable market, commitment to growth through acquisition and technology, and strong sales organization. The company also appears to have a long-range outlook, solid accounting controls, and good transparency with investors. However, the analysis reveals several areas of concern. The lack of specific R&D metrics, thin operating margins, and recent executive departures are notable weaknesses. The most significant concern is the cluster of legal and regulatory issues facing the company, which casts a shadow over its integrity and could pose a significant financial and reputational risk. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the resolution of the outstanding legal and regulatory matters, the successful integration of Brigit, and a demonstrated improvement in operating margins. A favorable resolution of the legal issues and evidence of strong performance from Brigit would be the most likely catalysts to turn the "No" on integrity and other points to a "Yes."
