### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oshkosh participates in diverse markets with strong long-term growth drivers. The Defense segment has a significant contract with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) for the Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV), with potential for up to 165,000 vehicles over 10 years, providing a long runway for growth. The Vocational segment is capitalizing on the growing demand for electric vehicles with the introduction of the Volterra platform for fire trucks and refuse vehicles. The Access segment, while cyclical, benefits from infrastructure spending and the ongoing replacement of aging rental fleets. The company's backlog of $14.74 billion as of December 31, 2024, further supports the potential for sustained sales growth.

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a U.S. government contractor, Oshkosh is subject to rigorous audits and reviews of its accounting and control systems by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) and the Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA). The company's financial statements are audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, which has issued an unqualified opinion. The detailed segment reporting in the 10-K provides a good level of transparency into the company's cost structure. The company uses the cost-to-cost method of percentage-of-completion accounting for its long-term defense contracts, which requires sophisticated cost estimation and tracking.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oshkosh's ability to win and execute large, complex, and long-term government contracts, such as the NGDV program for the USPS and various programs for the DoD, is a key differentiator. This demonstrates a high level of engineering expertise, manufacturing capability, and ability to navigate complex procurement processes. The company's focus on purpose-built vehicles, rather than mass-market products, allows it to develop deep expertise and strong brand recognition in its niche markets. The company's extensive aftermarket parts and service network also creates a recurring revenue stream and enhances customer loyalty.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oshkosh's investments in R&D, new product development (especially in electrification), and strategic acquisitions indicate a long-term growth perspective. The company's capital expenditures of $281 million in 2024, focused on expanding production capabilities, further support this view. While the company provides annual guidance, management's commentary in earnings calls consistently emphasizes long-term strategic goals and market leadership.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oshkosh has a strong balance sheet with a debt-to-total capitalization ratio of 18.8% at the end of 2024. The company generates significant cash from operations ($550.1 million in 2024) and has access to a $1.55 billion revolving credit facility. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, with a 10.9% increase in the quarterly dividend announced for 2025 and $116.0 million in share repurchases in 2024.

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oshkosh hosts regular quarterly earnings calls and provides detailed presentations and financial supplements. A review of the earnings call transcripts from 2023 to 2025 shows that management addresses challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and the loss of the JLTV follow-on contract, directly.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a Code of Conduct called "The Oshkosh Way" and requires all employees to complete training on it. The company also maintains a global ethics and compliance helpline for reporting potential violations. There are no mentions of major legal or regulatory issues related to management integrity in the 2024 10-K.

**Synthesis:**

Oshkosh Corporation scores highly on the Fisher checklist, with strengths across all categories. The company's diverse portfolio of essential, purpose-built vehicles provides a solid foundation for growth, while its commitment to innovation, particularly in electrification and autonomous technology, positions it well for the future. The strongest positives are the company's long-term government contracts, which provide revenue visibility, and its strong financial position, which allows for continued investment and shareholder returns. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the execution of the NGDV contract with the USPS and the cyclicality of the Access segment. A successful ramp-up of NGDV production would solidify the company's growth trajectory, while a significant downturn in construction and rental markets could impact the Access segment's profitability. To turn any "No" answers to "Yes," evidence of sustained outperformance in R&D productivity relative to peers and consistently high-teens or better operating margins across all segments would be required.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
