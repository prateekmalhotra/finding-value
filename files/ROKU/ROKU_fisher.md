Roku, Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku operates in the growing TV streaming market. The company's strategy is to grow its user base (Streaming Households) and then monetize that base through its high-margin Platform segment (advertising, content distribution). As of December 31, 2024, Roku had 89.8 million Streaming Households, an increase of 12% year-over-year. The company is also expanding internationally, which represents a significant growth opportunity. In its 2024 10-K, Roku states that it is the leading TV streaming platform in the United States, Canada, and Mexico by hours streamed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku has a history of innovation, from its streaming players to the Roku TV OS and The Roku Channel. The company continues to invest in research and development, with R&D expenses totaling $720.1 million in 2024. In its 2024 10-K, the company states its three key initiatives to grow platform revenue are to innovate the Roku Home Screen, grow advertising demand through deeper third-party platform integrations, and grow Roku-billed subscriptions. The company also launched its own line of Roku-branded TVs in 2023 and expanded the lineup in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was approximately 18% in 2024 ($720.1 million in R&D and $4,112.9 million in total net revenue). While this is a significant investment, the company has a strong track record of translating R&D into successful products, such as the Roku TV OS, which is the leading TV operating system in the U.S. by hours streamed. The company continues to innovate its advertising platform and user experience, which is crucial for its long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The growth in Roku's Platform segment revenue, which is primarily driven by advertising and content distribution, suggests an effective sales organization. Platform revenue grew 18% in 2024 to $3.5 billion. The company is also focused on expanding its programmatic advertising capabilities and relationships with third-party demand sources. In its 2024 10-K, Roku mentions its ad sales teams and products are organized into groups that specialize in the unique needs of each area, including agency holding companies, independent agencies, content partners, and international markets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's consolidated gross margin was 44% in 2024. However, this is a blend of a high-margin Platform segment (46% gross margin) and a negative-margin Devices segment (-2% gross margin). The company's strategy is to sell devices at or below cost to grow its user base, which in turn drives higher-margin Platform revenue. The company has a history of operating losses and had a net loss of $129.4 million in 2024.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku is focused on growing its higher-margin Platform revenue. The company is also taking steps to manage its operating expenses. In 2023 and 2024, Roku implemented restructuring plans that included workforce reductions, consolidating office space, and a strategic review of its content portfolio. These actions are intended to reduce the company's operating expense growth rate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000034/roku-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000034/roku-20240630.htm) (August 2, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information in the SEC filings about labor and personnel relations. The company did undertake workforce reductions in 2023 and 2024 as part of its restructuring plans, which can negatively impact employee morale. Without more information, it is difficult to assess the quality of labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000034/roku-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000034/roku-20240630.htm) (August 2, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Anthony Wood, the founder, has been Chairman and CEO since 2008, indicating stability at the top. The rest of the executive team listed in the 2024 10-K also appears to have a stable tenure with the company. There are no disclosed issues that would suggest poor executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K lists a number of executive officers beyond the CEO, including a President of Devices, a President of Media, and a CFO, suggesting a clear division of responsibilities. The company has been able to navigate a complex and competitive industry, which suggests a capable management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which has issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, which gives insight into the profitability of its different business lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's key competitive advantage is its large and engaged user base. The company's neutral platform status also makes it an attractive partner for content providers who may be hesitant to partner with competitors that are also major content owners, like Amazon and Google. The "Risk Factors" section of the 2024 10-K details the competitive landscape and highlights the importance of scale and user engagement in the TV streaming industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's strategy of subsidizing its Devices segment to grow its user base and Platform revenue is a clear indication of its long-range profit outlook. The company is willing to sacrifice short-term profitability to build a larger, more valuable ecosystem. In the 2024 10-K, the company states its goal is to continuously increase Free Cash Flow over time.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Roku had $2.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company has a history of operating losses, but it has been able to fund its growth without significant equity financing in recent years. In September 2024, the company entered into a credit agreement for a five-year revolving credit facility of up to $300.0 million, providing an additional source of liquidity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000042/roku-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000042/roku-20240930.htm) (October 31, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** It is difficult to fully assess this point without access to earnings call transcripts. However, the company's SEC filings provide a detailed discussion of the risks and challenges it faces, including the impact of macroeconomic conditions and competition. The "Risk Factors" section of the 10-K is comprehensive and does not appear to shy away from discussing potential problems.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K and Q1 2025 10-Q does not disclose any material legal proceedings that would bring into question the integrity of management. The dual-class stock structure, however, does concentrate voting power with the founder and CEO, which could be a corporate governance concern for some investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**Synthesis**

Roku scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly in its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and strong competitive position. The company's biggest weakness is its lack of profitability, which is a deliberate strategy to prioritize user growth. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to successfully monetize its growing international user base and its ability to achieve sustained profitability. A "No" on "Worthwhile Profit Margins" could flip to a "Yes" if the company can demonstrate a clear path to profitability without sacrificing its growth trajectory. The recent restructuring and focus on operating expense control will be important to watch in this regard.

fisher score is 13 / 15
