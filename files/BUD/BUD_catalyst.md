I have started by gathering some initial search results. The official AB InBev investor relations website is a key target, and I've found links to their recent earnings reports and presentations. The search results also point to some recent news about a $15M investment in their St. Louis brewery, which could be a potential catalyst. I will now proceed to browse these pages to get the primary documents. I need to find the latest 20-F, 10-Q, and the Q2 2025 earnings call transcript.
The link to the investor relations page from the search result seems to be having an issue. I'll try a more direct approach to find the SEC filings and earnings call transcript. I will use a new search query to find the latest annual report (20-F) and quarterly reports (10-Q). I will also search for the Q2 2025 earnings call transcript.I have successfully retrieved the Q2 2025 earnings call transcript for BUD. I also checked for insider trading activity and, based on the `openinsider` browse result, there's no recent insider activity to note. From the earnings call, I have key financial performance data, including EBITDA growth, revenue per hectoliter growth, free cash flow increase, and progress on deleveraging. I also have information on business progress in premium and non-alcohol segments, and the BEES marketplace, alongside risks and opportunities.

My next step is to find the most recent 20-F (annual report) to get more detailed financial data and risk factor disclosures. The SEC filing search results were not definitive, so I will try a more specific search for the 20-F. After securing the 20-F, I will have the necessary primary documents to construct the detailed catalyst analysis.I've successfully located the 20-F annual report for the year ended December 31, 2024, filed on March 12, 2025. I also have the Q2 2025 earnings call transcript. These primary source documents, along with the other search results, provide the necessary information to perform the catalyst analysis. I can now move on to the analysis and structuring of the final output. I have sufficient information to proceed with the detailed analysis and construction of the final report.

I will now synthesize the gathered information and generate the final, structured response as requested by the user, meticulously citing the sources I have found.

Final Answer: I will now generate the full response based on the information I have gathered. I have the 20-F, the Q2 2025 earnings call transcript, and other relevant news and filings. I will structure this information into the detailed format requested by the user, providing a comprehensive catalyst analysis for BUD.

**3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Deleveraging and Improved Credit Rating
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Continued reduction of the company's significant debt burden, leading to a potential credit rating upgrade. As of Q2 2025, the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio improved to 3.27x from 3.42x year-over-year. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 31, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** A lower debt-to-EBITDA ratio reduces financial risk, lowers borrowing costs, and could lead to a credit rating upgrade. This would make the stock more attractive to a wider range of investors, potentially leading to a re-rating of the stock's valuation multiple.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Debt/EBITDA remains flat at ~3.3x.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Debt/EBITDA improves to ~3.0x.
    *   **High Scenario:** Debt/EBITDA improves to below 3.0x.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a stated goal of deleveraging and has a demonstrated track record of using free cash flow to pay down debt.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong free cash flow generation and disciplined capital allocation.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Net debt-to-EBITDA ratio (reported quarterly).
    *   Free cash flow generation (reported quarterly).
    *   Credit rating agency reports (Moody's, S&P).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in profitability would slow the pace of deleveraging.
    *   Large, debt-financed acquisitions.
    *   Rising interest rates increasing the cost of refinancing existing debt.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Non-Alcohol Beer Portfolio Expansion
*   **Type:** Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Continued rapid growth in the non-alcoholic beer segment, capitalizing on consumer trends towards health and wellness. In Q2 2025, the non-alcohol beer portfolio revenue grew by 33%. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 31, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** The non-alcoholic beer market is growing faster than the traditional beer market. By capturing a significant share of this market, BUD can offset slow growth or declines in its core beer markets, leading to higher overall revenue growth and a potential increase in the company's valuation multiple.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Non-alcohol beer revenue growth slows to 15%.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Non-alcohol beer revenue growth continues at ~25%.
    *   **High Scenario:** Non-alcohol beer revenue growth accelerates to >35%.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company is actively investing in and promoting its non-alcoholic brands, and consumer trends support continued growth in this segment.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful new product launches and effective marketing campaigns.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Revenue growth of the non-alcohol beer portfolio (reported quarterly).
    *   Market share data for the non-alcoholic beer segment.

*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Increased competition from other beverage companies entering the non-alcoholic beer space.
    *   Changes in consumer preferences.
    *   Execution risk on new product launches.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

**4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Growth of BEES B2B Platform
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The BEES platform, a B2B e-commerce platform for small and medium-sized retailers, is experiencing rapid growth, with the potential to become a significant, high-margin revenue stream. In Q2 2025, BEES marketplace GMV increased by 63% to $785 million. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 31, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** As the BEES platform scales, it can generate high-margin revenue from both first-party and third-party sales. The data collected through the platform can also be used to improve sales and marketing efficiency. This new revenue stream and improved efficiency could lead to a significant increase in profitability and a higher valuation for the company.
*   **Timing:** August 2026 – August 2030
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** BEES GMV growth slows to 20% annually.
    *   **Base Scenario:** BEES GMV grows at 40% annually for the next 3 years.

| 3 | Non-Alcohol Beer Portfolio Expansion | Product | Near | 2 | 4 | 5-10% | 8 |

**6) Timeline / Gantt (concise)**

|---|---|---|---|---|
| Deleveraging and Improved Credit Rating | X | X | X | X |
| Non-Alcohol Beer Portfolio Expansion | X | X | X | X |
| Growth of BEES B2B Platform | X | X | X | X |

**7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Deleveraging and Improved Credit Rating:**
*   **Current State:** Net Debt/EBITDA of 3.27x (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 31, 2025).
*   **Catalyst Scenario:** If BUD reduces its Net Debt/EBITDA to 3.0x, this could lead to a re-rating of its EV/EBITDA multiple from its current ~10x to ~11x. This 1.0x multiple expansion would translate to a ~10% increase in the share price.

**2. Growth of BEES B2B Platform:**
*   **Current State:** BEES GMV of $785 million in Q2 2025 (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 31, 2025).
*   **Catalyst Scenario:** If BEES GMV grows at 40% annually for the next three years, it will reach ~$3.8 billion. Assuming a 5% take rate, this would generate ~$190 million in high-margin revenue, which could add ~$2-3 billion to BUD's market capitalization, representing a ~2-3% increase in the share price.

**8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for BUD are moderately positive. Continued deleveraging and growth in the non-alcohol beer segment should provide a tailwind for the stock over the next 12 months. However, the most significant catalyst, the growth of the BEES B2B platform, is a longer-term story. In the short-term, the stock is likely to be driven by execution on its deleveraging plan and the performance of its core beer brands in key markets.

**10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A global recession:** A significant global economic downturn would negatively impact beer volumes and pricing power, hindering the company's ability to generate the free cash flow needed to deleverage and invest in growth initiatives.
2.  **A significant shift in consumer preferences away from beer:** While the company is investing in non-alcoholic beer and other beverages, it is still heavily reliant on its core beer brands. A rapid acceleration of the trend towards wine and spirits could have a material negative impact on the business.
3.  **A major operational disruption:** A major product recall, supply chain disruption, or a significant cyberattack could have a material negative impact on the company's financial performance and reputation.

**11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

The near-term outlook for BUD is moderately positive, with continued deleveraging and growth in the non-alcohol beer segment as key catalysts. The long-term growth story is more compelling, with the BEES B2B platform having the potential to become a significant, high-margin business. The most important indicator to monitor is the company's progress on its deleveraging plan, as this will have the most significant impact on the stock in the near-term.
