### PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $46.56 USD per share (as of August 22, 2025, close).

2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM as of June 30, 2025):** The following table presents the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) financial data for On Holding AG. The reporting currency is Swiss Francs (CHF).

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the assumptions baked into the current market price, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used. The goal is to find the 5-year revenue growth rate and operating margin that justify the $46.56 USD share price.

*   **Discount Rate (WACC) used for Market Implied calculation:**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.26% (10-Year US Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   Beta: 1.52 (A beta above 1 indicates higher volatility than the market average).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (Standard assumption for a developed market).
    *   Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.52 * 5.0% = 11.86%
    *   Cost of Debt = 17.9M / 497.8M = 3.6%
    *   WACC is calculated based on market values.

*   **Terminal Value Assumptions:**
    *   Perpetual Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (in-line with long-term inflation expectations).

After iterating, the model shows that to justify the current market price of $46.56, one must believe On Holding AG can achieve the following:

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue Growth:** **Approximately 22% CAGR.**
*   **Market-Implied Operating Margin:** **Stable at the TTM level of 10.85%.**

This implies a belief in sustained high-speed growth, significantly outpacing the broader apparel and footwear market, while maintaining current profitability levels.

### PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The original analysis correctly identifies the market's aggressive growth assumptions. However, its own base-case assumptions were overly punitive, particularly the flat 10% EBIT margin and the resulting 5.0x implied exit multiple from the Gordon Growth model, which is unrealistic for a premium consumer brand. The following revisions aim for a more balanced and realistic scenario.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:** A tapering growth model remains appropriate. The original's 20% starting point is a steep deceleration from the 48% CAGR (2021-2024). A more realistic base case acknowledges continued brand momentum. I will model growth starting at **25%** in Year 1 and tapering to **10%** by Year 5. This is still a conservative deceleration but better reflects the company's trajectory.

8.  **Margin Path:** As a company scales, it should achieve operating leverage. A flat margin assumption is too conservative. I project the EBIT margin expanding from **11.5%** in Year 1 (a slight improvement on TTM) to **13.5%** by Year 5, driven by scale efficiencies in marketing and G&A expenses.

9.  **Taxes:** The original assumption is sound. The TTM effective tax rate is an anomaly. Using a normalized statutory rate is correct for long-term forecasting. I will maintain a **21% effective tax rate**.

10. **Capital Intensity:** The original assumptions are well-reasoned and based on historicals. I will maintain them.
    *   **Capex:** Projected at **3.5% of annual revenue.**
    *   **Working Capital:** Change in Working Capital modeled as **2.5% of incremental revenue.**

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:** The original assumptions are appropriate for a growth company. I will maintain them.
    *   **SBC:** Modeled at **2.0% of revenue.** This is a real economic cost to shareholders.
    *   **Dilution:** Projecting a net **1.5% annual increase in diluted shares outstanding.**

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Calculation:** Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated after accounting for all operating expenses, including stock-based compensation, before financing costs.
    **Revised FCFF Formula:** NOPAT (Net Operating Profit After Tax) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital.
    *Note: SBC is treated as a real expense and is already included in the EBIT calculation.*

| (CHF millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 3,398 | 4,077 | 4,729 | 5,344 | 5,878 |

| + D&A (4.0% of Rev) | 135.9 | 163.1 | 189.2 | 213.8 | 235.1 |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate (Rf): 4.26% (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury, Aug 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium (ERP): 5.0% (standard assumption).
    *   Beta (β): 1.52. This reflects higher-than-market volatility, appropriate for a high-growth consumer discretionary stock.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.52 * 5.0% = 11.86%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense (TTM) / Total Debt (TTM) = 17.9M / 497.8M = 3.6%.
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.6% * (1 - 0.21) = **2.84%**

16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Cap (USD) = $15.20B (CHF 13.7B).
    *   Total Debt = CHF 497.8M.
    *   Enterprise Value = 13.7B + 497.8M = CHF 14.2B.
    *   **WACC = (96.5% * 11.86%) + (3.5% * 2.84%) = 11.55%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Gordon Growth Method Reality Check:** The original analysis correctly identified that a 2.5% perpetual growth rate resulted in an unrealistically low 5.0x exit multiple. This indicates a mismatch between the inputs. A healthy, mature premium brand should command a better valuation.

18. **Revised Approach: Exit Multiple Method:** A more reliable method is to use a terminal EV/EBITDA multiple that reflects what a mature, stable version of On Holding would trade at.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT_Yr5 + D&A_Yr5 = 793.6M + 235.1M = **CHF 1,028.7M**.
    *   Peers and mature premium brands like Lululemon or Moncler often trade in a 12x-18x EV/EBITDA range. A conservative but realistic multiple for a matured On would be in the lower-to-mid end of this range. I will use a **14.0x exit multiple**.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 1,028.7M * 14.0 = CHF 14,402 million.**
    *   **Cross-Check:** This terminal value implies a perpetual growth rate (g) of **4.4%** (g = WACC - (FCFF_Yr6 / TV)). This is higher than the long-term economic growth rate but plausible for a premium brand continuing to take market share globally, justifying the 14.0x multiple as reasonable.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = 318.7/(1.1155)^1 + 389.9/(1.1155)^2 + 474.4/(1.1155)^3 + 560.2/(1.1155)^4 + 643.0/(1.1155)^5 = 1,677.1M
    *   PV of Terminal Value = 14,402 / (1.1155)^5 = **CHF 8,333.6M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = 1,677.1M + 8,333.6M = CHF 10,010.7 million**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = 497.8M - 846.6M = -CHF 348.8M (Net Cash).
    *   **Equity Value = 10,010.7M - (-348.8M) = CHF 10,359.5 million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Current Diluted Shares: 332M.
    *   Projected Year 5 Shares (1.5% annual growth) = 332 * (1.015)^5 = **~358 million shares.**
    *   Fair Value per Share (CHF) = 10,359.5M / 358M = **CHF 28.94**
    *   Assuming a USD/CHF exchange rate of 1.11, Fair Value per Share (USD) = **$32.12**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $32.12.**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $24.00.** (Assumes 20% initial growth tapering to 8%, 12.5% terminal EBIT margin, 12x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $41.50.** (Assumes 30% initial growth tapering to 12%, 14.5% terminal EBIT margin, 15x exit multiple).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $32.12 * (1 - 0.30) = $22.48**

### Risk Notes

1.  **Competition:** The athletic footwear and apparel market is intensely competitive, with giants like Nike, Adidas, and Hoka (Deckers) having immense scale and marketing power.
2.  **Fashion Risk:** On's popularity is currently high, but consumer tastes can be fickle. A shift in trends could rapidly decelerate growth.
3.  **Valuation Risk:** Even with this revised valuation, the stock's current market price of $46.56 is significantly above the base-case fair value, indicating the market is pricing in a far more optimistic scenario. Failure to meet these lofty expectations could lead to a significant price correction.
4.  **Supply Chain:** Dependence on manufacturing in Asia exposes the company to geopolitical risks, shipping disruptions, and input cost volatility.
