Company: Levi Strauss & Co. (LEVI), August 24, 2025, Primary Sources Reviewed: Q2 2025 10-Q, Q1 2025 10-Q, FY 2024 10-K, Q3 2024 10-Q, Q2 2024 10-Q filings, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Levi Strauss & Co. continues to focus on its core denim products while expanding into other categories like tops, footwear, and accessories. The company is driving growth through its direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel, which saw a 10% increase in the second quarter of 2025, and by expanding its international presence. Management has identified women's apparel, tops, and international expansion as key growth drivers. The global denim market is projected to continue growing, providing a solid foundation for Levi's core business.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively investing in expanding its product lines beyond denim, with a stated goal of becoming a "denim lifestyle leader." This includes a focus on growing the women's category and tops, which have shown strong performance. The company is also investing heavily in its DTC transformation, including opening new stores and improving its e-commerce capabilities, to better control its brand presentation and customer relationships. In the second quarter of 2025, the company highlighted the success of new innovations in women's tops and non-denim bottoms as key drivers of growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Levi Strauss & Co. does not explicitly break out R&D spending in its financial statements, which is common in the apparel industry. Innovation is discussed in terms of product design, marketing, and supply chain improvements rather than traditional R&D. The company's focus on fabric and fit innovation, such as the successful women's non-denim bottoms, demonstrates effective product development. However, without specific metrics on R&D spending and returns, it's difficult to definitively assess its effectiveness relative to the company's size against competitors.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is strategically shifting its sales mix towards a more profitable DTC model, which now represents 47% of total net revenues as of the second quarter of 2025, up from 42% in the prior year. This DTC expansion, which includes company-operated stores and e-commerce, gives Levi's greater control over its sales process and customer experience. The continued growth in this channel, alongside a large, established wholesale business with major retailers, indicates a strong and evolving sales organization. The 10% growth in the DTC channel in Q2 2025 underscores its effectiveness.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000036/lvis-20250601.htm' (June 1, 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the second quarter of 2025, Levi Strauss & Co. reported a gross margin of 60.3%. The company's operating margin is being impacted by restructuring charges, but the adjusted EBIT margin was 7.5% in the same period. While the gross margin is healthy, the company's overall profitability has been under pressure due to a challenging wholesale environment and restructuring costs. Management is targeting a 15% adjusted EBIT margin long-term, indicating the current margin is below its potential.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000036/lvis-20250601.htm' (June 1, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LEVI/transcripts/' (July 10, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is executing a multi-pronged strategy to improve margins. A key initiative is "Project FUEL," a productivity and cost-saving plan expected to generate significant annualized savings. The company is also focused on shifting its sales mix towards the higher-margin DTC channel, which has already resulted in gross margin expansion. Additionally, the company is using advanced analytics for promotion and markdown optimization to further enhance profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000036/lvis-20250601.htm' (June 1, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LEVI/transcripts/' (July 10, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K notes that as of November 26, 2023, approximately 58% of its total employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. There are no recent, widespread reports of major labor disputes or strikes. The company includes standard disclosures about the risks of labor disputes, but there is no evidence to suggest current relations are poor. However, there is also a lack of publicly available, detailed information to definitively classify them as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000005/lvis-20241201.htm' (December 1, 2024)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Levi Strauss & Co. has demonstrated a stable and experienced leadership team. The company successfully managed a CEO transition in early 2024 from Chip Bergh to Michelle Gass, who was hired in 2022 as President with a clear succession plan in place. This indicates thoughtful long-term planning by the board. The executive team has been consistent, with long-tenured members leading key divisions and functions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000005/lvis-20241201.htm' (December 1, 2024)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership team, as detailed in its corporate governance materials and filings, includes seasoned executives beyond the CEO. For example, Harmit Singh has served as the Chief Financial and Growth Officer for over a decade. The company also has presidents for each of its major geographic regions (Americas, Europe, and Asia/Middle East/Africa) and leaders for key functions, suggesting a deep bench of operational experience. The planned CEO transition in 2024 further highlights this depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000005/lvis-20241201.htm' (December 1, 2024)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which has provided an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The financial statements provide detailed segment information, allowing for analysis of performance by region and channel. There is no history of major restatements or disclosed material weaknesses, indicating that the accounting controls are robust and effective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000005/lvis-20241201.htm' (December 1, 2024)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the apparel industry, brand equity is a paramount competitive advantage. The Levi's brand is one of the most recognized and culturally significant names in the world, giving it pricing power and consumer loyalty that many competitors lack. The company's global scale and growing DTC channel, which allows it to control its brand narrative and customer data directly, are also key differentiators. The company's ability to maintain its relevance for over 170 years is a powerful testament to its unique position.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000005/lvis-20241201.htm' (December 1, 2024)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is making significant short-term investments and undertaking restructuring (the "Project FUEL" initiative) that negatively impact near-term profits in exchange for long-term growth and margin expansion. The strategic focus on building out the DTC channel, expanding internationally, and growing non-denim categories are all long-term initiatives. Management's consistent communication about its long-term target of a 15% adjusted EBIT margin demonstrates a focus on durable, future profitability over immediate results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LEVI/transcripts/' (July 10, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 1, 2025, the company had $506 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. The company generates positive cash flow from operations and has a revolving credit facility available. While the company has debt, its financial position appears sufficient to fund its capital expenditures and strategic initiatives without needing to issue significant equity. The company also has a share repurchase program in place, indicating it is more likely to reduce share count than to increase it.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000036/lvis-20250601.htm' (June 1, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed the challenges in the U.S. wholesale market, acknowledging a "subdued" environment and a "cautious" outlook from retail partners. They provided specific details on the actions being taken to address these issues, including the "Project FUEL" restructuring. This willingness to address headwinds directly and provide a clear strategy for navigating them demonstrates a high level of candor with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LEVI/transcripts/' (July 10, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings, including the legal proceedings and corporate governance sections, reveals no major red flags or indications of a lack of integrity. The company has a long-standing reputation, and there are no significant regulatory actions, scandals, or related-party transactions that would call the integrity of the leadership team into question. Standard governance practices appear to be in place.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/94845/000009484525000005/lvis-20241201.htm' (December 1, 2024)]

Synthesis:
Levi Strauss & Co. scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly in areas related to its long-term strategy, brand strength, and management quality. The company's strongest positives are its iconic brand, a clear commitment to long-range growth through its DTC transformation and international expansion, and a stable, transparent management team. The primary negatives are the current state of its profit margins, which are below their long-term potential, and a lack of specific disclosure on R&D effectiveness. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on the success of the "Project FUEL" initiative in delivering cost savings and margin improvements. A sustained recovery in the U.S. wholesale channel and continued double-digit growth in the DTC business would also be key catalysts. The "No" for worthwhile profit margins would flip to "Yes" if the company demonstrates consistent progress towards its 15% adjusted EBIT margin target.

fisher score is 12 / 15
