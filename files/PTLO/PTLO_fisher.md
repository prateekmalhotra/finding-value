Portillo's Inc. (PTLO), August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-Q filed May 6, 2025, and earnings call transcripts from 2024 and 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Portillo's has a clear and active expansion strategy, planning to open 12 new restaurants in 2025 with a focus on high-growth Sunbelt markets like Texas, Atlanta, and San Antonio. The company is also developing new, smaller-footprint formats, such as walk-up and airport locations, to broaden its market penetration. This dual approach of geographic expansion and format innovation provides a long runway for sales growth beyond its established Chicago base.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy is guided by four pillars, including "Innovating and amplifying the Portillo's experience." Specific initiatives launched in 2025 include the "Portillo's Perks" loyalty program to drive digital engagement and a breakfast menu test at five locations. This demonstrates a focus on enhancing the customer experience, driving traffic, and exploring new revenue streams beyond simply adding new stores.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a restaurant, R&D is reflected in menu innovation and operational improvements. The company's filings mention "purposeful menu innovation," highlighted by a current breakfast test. However, management provides no specific metrics on the success rates of new product launches, the contribution of new items to sales, or return on investment for these initiatives. Without such data, the effectiveness of these efforts cannot be independently verified.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Portillo's demonstrates a superior sales model through its consistently high Average Unit Volumes (AUVs), which were $8.7 million for the twelve months ended March 30, 2025. The company is supporting its expansion with targeted advertising campaigns in new markets like Dallas-Fort Worth and Phoenix. In the first quarter of 2025, same-restaurant sales increased by 1.8%, driven by a 4.9% increase in average check, indicating strong pricing power and brand loyalty.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Portillo’s reported a Restaurant-Level Adjusted EBITDA Margin of 20.8% in the first quarter of 2025 and targets a range of 22.5% to 23% for the full year. This is substantially higher than the typical 6-9% profit margin for fast-casual restaurants, indicating a very strong and worthwhile profit structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHcp_9YRAF39Fv_Kh42_4KY9-RsaoetXZyxzJL1tg6yyuKUcJx1VXScd_pZI0btEmL83Is25eB0PtqBw87MmEDjCtYTtAK4sPzeI8yiLQL4o9bFFy4W3Lf-cjtHyGqUEeU3IIQO64Axe1E9Ko0aBUigisP1u9VB7FexTdDgkxvHBj1h8YZw4jTUaew1pHEhC99yOeQ2AhbYKKbPAjecQNG_BuaypvNAekVchNMh9VCrXR8BY4pUmn5wnRKZ4_keZzuw (February 25, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFCUyuV2GSf0bmqyCn9hUd-eIzpiO6FfQ6uZkRBD6XF4kl0ltKl5EGtvqUg_u44PQqtoHnEkQI9wqm5W_FaaoLARjKc3xoPrLRNJgFT3DWy8u7hdZNhJDNKVwZa_yfyD8hTipi3_cscuKQcNsqDJkBXZfvs-0rEuwzUljX3qvwoZB3KmP7Fko_DapheEH311uF9lw==, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFrgSnioePqjnlBcU0MpTVM5ubL-oBz8_rGA0JT9yahxGy8c_uU9uT9dQh0FMWvp9kithBkwWyrgrUg0wa6aD3wch4U5YqX5EHth_4njxvxaDGCHGZPY8ZaXykISX5wO1enMk9wUZhjzDrTAOY1YD1OL_8=

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to protect margins. To combat commodity inflation of 3.4%, the company implemented menu price increases of approximately 1.5% in January 2025 and 1.0% in April 2025. To offset wage inflation, the company is focused on improving "labor efficiencies," including initiatives to increase drive-thru speed and throughput.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHcp_9YRAF39Fv_Kh42_4KY9-RsaoetXZyxzJL1tg6yyuKUcJx1VXScd_pZI0btEmL83Is25eB0PtqBw87MmEDjCtYTtAK4sPzeI8yiLQL4o9bFFy4W3Lf-cjtHyGqUEeU3IIQO64Axe1E9Ko0aBUigisP1u9VB7FexTdDgkxvHBj1h8YZw4jTUaew1pHEhC99yOeQ2AhbYKKbPAjecQNG_BuaypvNAekVchNMh9VCrXR8BY4pUmn5wnRKZ4_keZzuw (February 25, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** One of the company's four strategic pillars is "Taking great care of our teams," which includes creating a "meaningful work environment" and offering "total rewards that matter." However, the company does not disclose key metrics such as employee turnover, engagement scores, or unionization rates. While the stated intention is positive, there is no verifiable evidence to confirm that labor relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In March 2025, activist investor Engaged Capital LLC, which holds a nearly 10% stake, nominated two independent candidates to the company's board, signaling dissatisfaction with the company's strategy and performance. While the company entered into a "cooperation agreement" with the firm in April 2025 to avoid a proxy fight, the event itself indicates a level of friction that is not consistent with "outstanding" executive and board relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGHK7Uca6WsjIyS05QLod3Q2xojMEo8wqpq7dJvFhzQQCcw0lGoeMPYErNHjJUQs7rPfTLm3wGroZRW57kGkD1-5shhRxaHxOMhLLFnVzHR7xuq_wv2uGBu4vhqKk0ylqAAN9Mpg4M48W2IrRkFozssLkaL8SD24hHkla6m5LPnfqdULLenaZEMrjrvE9FQUDwBqQ8eWAGnaWDITCTD3gYVjTBcCqtqdL7bXcXo8Daj0yC_qnYt4knOqvhMUlC6No8= (March 3, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Portillo's has a full and experienced executive team beyond the CEO. The leadership team includes a CFO, a recently hired COO (December 2024), CIO, and Chief Development Officer. These executives bring experience from major industry players such as Domino's, Jack in the Box, Panera Bread, and P.F. Chang's, indicating a strong bench of talent to execute the company's growth strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE4WMouPy4SPOhWIjLcUEGrxNvYbSKs79696JKjQG_aumcCt5uqO2X8nvJr62MXvI9I7O1X7oSfaTiwJW8jH5K0KW_xoMFw99k2uvatEdbO5lqR77G8D2onIVRP9XUNMlaTmMS6D28e4x7ifvjX1yNAa5lTB_Dq6TIWJ1w= (Accessed August 24, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its most recent 10-Q filing for the quarter ended March 30, 2025, management concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls, and its financial reporting provides clear segmentation of restaurant-level costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Portillo's primary competitive advantage is its "destination" brand status combined with a high-volume, multi-channel operating model, leading to industry-leading AUVs of $8.7 million. The brand's cult-like following, born from its Chicago heritage, allows for successful expansion into new states where brand awareness is initially low. This powerful combination of brand equity and operational efficiency sets it apart from typical fast-casual competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy is heavily weighted toward long-term unit growth, with plans to open 12 new restaurants in 2025. This expansion requires significant upfront capital expenditures ($19.0 million in Q1 2025) and pre-opening expenses that depress short-term profits. Management's focus on building out new markets and investing in brand awareness demonstrates a willingness to prioritize long-term scale and market share over maximizing near-term earnings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 30, 2025, the company's growth is primarily funded by debt, with approximately $320 million outstanding and $71.7 million available on its revolver. Operating cash flow of $9.5 million in the first quarter did not cover the $19.0 million in capital expenditures for new restaurants. While the business generates cash, its aggressive expansion outpaces internal cash generation, creating a reliance on debt. An unexpected downturn could strain its finances and increase the risk of a dilutive equity offering to fund its growth plans.
**Answer:** No

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is transparent in its disclosures and commentary. In the first quarter of 2025, they openly discussed the 3.1% decline in transactions, attributing it to macroeconomic pressures and acknowledging the challenge. They also directly addressed slower-than-expected starts for new restaurants in Texas and proactively updated their full-year guidance to reflect a more cautious outlook. This willingness to confront challenges publicly demonstrates candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of public records and the company's SEC filings reveals no material legal proceedings, regulatory actions, or scandals that would call the integrity of the senior management team into question. The company notes it is party to routine legal proceedings normal for a business of its size, but nothing suggests a pattern of misconduct. There are no significant related-party transactions or governance red flags.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1871509/000187150925000094/ptlo-20250330.htm (May 6, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFAvggVcM7nIfgRmZyUk597uCjXBK8dTfAiBoZvHknydsDoGRtzO90DMutGY72j8t8-E0eIxmumcxx-NNHA7wVSemyIO6gCTLH5HJKIH9RO38cLYI_zuCKEWJlmD38BXBSWQAFcKxBE

**Synthesis**
Portillo's scores well on Fisher's checklist, exhibiting strong brand power, a clear growth runway, industry-leading profitability, and a deep management team. Its primary strengths are its exceptional unit economics and the cult-like brand following that enables successful national expansion. The main weaknesses identified are a lack of verifiable data on R&D effectiveness and labor relations, recent board-level friction with an activist investor, and a reliance on debt to fund its aggressive growth strategy. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the performance of its new restaurants in expansion markets and its ability to improve transaction trends. A successful ramp-up in the Sunbelt and a reversal of negative traffic would bolster confidence in its long-term growth and could flip the "No" on Equity Financing Dilution Risk to "Yes" by demonstrating stronger internal cash generation.

fisher score is 11 / 15
