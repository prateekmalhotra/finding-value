| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | 8.0% | Midpoint of "high single-digit" management guidance for Q2, applied to the full year. |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)** | 4.0% | Tapering to a sustainable long-term growth rate reflecting market maturity. |

| **Tax Rate** | 22.0% | Average of the last 3 fiscal years' effective tax rates, normalizing for fluctuations. (2025: 19.5%, 2024: 24.6%, 2023: 27.8%) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 4.0% | Based on management's FY2026 guidance ($240M) relative to forecasted revenue, then held steady as a percentage of sales. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,133 | $6,379 | $6,634 | $6,899 | $7,175 |
| EBIT (9.3%) | $570.4 | $593.2 | $616.9 | $641.6 | $667.3 |
| Tax (22.0%) | ($125.5) | ($130.5) | ($135.7) | ($141.2) | ($146.8) |
| **NOPAT** | **$444.9** | **$462.7** | **$481.2** | **$500.5** | **$520.5** |
| D&A | $134.9 | $140.3 | $145.9 | $151.8 | $157.9 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | **11.0%** | `Rf + Beta * ERP = 4.3% + 1.34 * 5.0%` |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.3% | 10-Year US Treasury Yield (YCharts, August 22, 2025) |
| Beta | 1.34 | Reflects higher volatility than the market, consistent for a discretionary retailer (Investing.com, May 21, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.0% | Standard market assumption. |
| **Cost of Debt** | 0.5% | `Interest Expense / Total Debt = $5.8M / $1,141.0M` (using total lease liabilities as debt proxy). |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 0.4% | `0.5% * (1 - 22.0%)` |
| Market Cap (E) | $6,620 | (stockanalysis.com, August 22, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $1,141 | (stockanalysis.com, April 30, 2025) |
| **WACC** | **9.4%** | `(E/(E+D) * Ke) + (D/(E+D) * Kd * (1-t)) = (85.3% * 11.0%) + (14.7% * 0.4%)` |

---

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Value | Calculation & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth (Perpetuity)** | **$5,084** | `(Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($338.1 * 1.025) / (9.4% - 2.5%)` |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.5% | Assumed long-run inflation expectation, a conservative and sustainable rate. |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | | |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $825.2 M | `EBIT_Y5 + D&A_Y5 = $667.3M + $157.9M` |
| Implied Exit Multiple | 6.2x | `Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA = $5,084M / $825.2M` |
| Justification | The 6.2x multiple is in line with historical retail sector averages during stable periods, confirming the Gordon Growth assumption is reasonable. |

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (USD Millions) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Forecast FCFF | $1,213 | `Sum of PV(FCFF_Y1..Y5) @ 9.4% WACC` |
| PV of Terminal Value | $3,258 | `$5,084 / (1 + 9.4%)^5` |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$4,471** | `PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value` |
| Less: Total Debt | ($1,141) | (Balance Sheet, April 30, 2025) |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents | $189 | (Balance Sheet, April 30, 2025) |
| **Equity Value** | **$3,519** | `EV - Debt + Cash` |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Key Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case Fair Value** | **$37.44** | `Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $3,519M / 94.0M` |
| **Low / Bear Case** | $28.00 | Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 2-3% annually) and margin compression due to competition, leading to lower FCFF. |
| **High / Bull Case** | $48.00 | Assumes sustained high-single-digit growth and successful margin expansion from brand initiatives, leading to higher FCFF. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$26.21** | `Base Case * (1 - 30%)` |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Fashion & Trend Risk:** URBN's brands are highly susceptible to shifts in consumer fashion preferences. A failure to anticipate trends could lead to inventory markdowns and significant margin compression.
2.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a seller of discretionary goods, URBN's sales are sensitive to economic downturns, inflation, and reduced consumer spending power.
3.  **Competition:** The apparel retail landscape is intensely competitive, with pressure from fast-fashion, online retailers, and established brands, which could limit pricing power and growth.
4.  **Nuuly Growth Deceleration:** The valuation incorporates strong growth from the Nuuly rental segment. Any slowdown in subscriber acquisition or profitability in this segment poses a risk to the overall growth thesis.
