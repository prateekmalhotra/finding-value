### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

As of the latest earnings call for Q1 2025, management has not provided explicit, forward-looking numerical guidance for full-year revenue, margins, or capex. Commentary suggests a positive outlook, but without specific figures, guidance is considered neutral for this model. Projections will rely on historical performance and stated business strategy.

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **6.0%** | Based on the 3-year historical revenue CAGR of 16%, tempered by the cyclical nature of the energy services industry and a move towards a more mature growth phase. This rate is a conservative estimate of sustainable growth. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **12.2%** | TTM Operating Margin. Held constant as there is no specific management guidance on margin expansion initiatives. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **25.0%** | A normalized statutory tax rate is assumed, as the company's historical effective tax rate has been volatile due to valuation allowances and discrete items. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **12.7%** | Based on the TTM Capex as a percentage of TTM Revenue. Assumed to remain constant. |
| **Change in WC as % of Rev** | **3.3%** | Based on the TTM Change in Working Capital as a percentage of TTM Revenue. Assumed to remain constant. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **1.5%** | Based on the TTM Stock-Based Compensation as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.5%** | Represents a reasonable long-term growth rate in line with expected long-run inflation and global economic growth. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - SBC

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,454.9 | $1,542.1 | $1,634.7 | $1,732.8 | $1,836.7 |
| EBIT (12.2%) | $177.5 | $188.1 | $199.4 | $211.4 | $224.1 |
| NOPAT | $133.1 | $141.1 | $149.6 | $158.5 | $168.1 |
| D&A | $180.0 | $190.8 | $202.2 | $214.3 | $227.6 |
| Capex | ($184.8) | ($195.9) | ($207.6) | ($210.0) | ($233.3) |
| Change in WC | ($48.0) | ($50.9) | ($54.0) | ($57.2) | ($60.6) |
| SBC | ($21.8) | ($23.1) | ($24.5) | ($26.0) | ($27.6) |
| **FCFF** | **$58.5** | **$62.0** | **$65.7** | **$69.6** | **$74.2** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | | **CAPM = Rf + Beta * ERP** |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.10% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield as of August 2025. |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.0% | Standard market premium for a developed market like the U.S. |
| Levered Beta (Î²) | 1.80 | Sourced from Yahoo Finance (5Y Monthly). A beta > 1 reflects higher volatility than the overall market, consistent with the cyclical energy sector. |
| *Calculated Cost of Equity* | *13.10%* | *4.10% + 1.80 * 5.0%* |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | | **Interest Expense / Total Debt** |
| Interest Expense | $19.9 M | TTM Interest Expense. |
| Total Debt | $250.2 M | As of March 31, 2025. |
| *Calculated Cost of Debt* | *7.95%* | *$19.9 M / $250.2 M* |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 5.96% | 7.95% * (1 - 25.0%) |
| **WACC** | | **(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-t))** |
| Market Cap (E) | $1,988.4 M | As of August 2025. |
| Total Debt (D) | $250.2 M | As of March 31, 2025. |
| Enterprise Value (V) | $2,238.6 M | E + D |
| *Calculated WACC* | ***12.18%*** | *(1988.4/2238.6 * 13.10%) + (250.2/2238.6 * 5.96%)* |

### **F) Terminal Value**

**Gordon Growth Model:**
*   **Formula:** Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
*   **Calculation:** ($74.2 * (1 + 2.5%)) / (12.18% - 2.5%) = **$785.4 M**

**Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $224.1 M + $227.6 M = $451.7 M
*   Historical Median EV/EBITDA multiple for HLX is ~6.0x.
*   Implied Terminal Value = $451.7 M * 6.0 = $2,710.2 M
*   **Decision:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value and is chosen for the base case.

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **$3.68** | **Equity Value / Diluted Shares ($609.4 M / 165.7 M)** |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Commodity Price Volatility:** As an energy services company, HLX's financial performance is intrinsically linked to oil and gas prices, which drive drilling and production activity. A downturn in energy prices could significantly reduce demand for their services.
2.  **High Beta and Market Sensitivity:** The stock's high beta (1.80) indicates significant volatility and sensitivity to market movements, making it a higher-risk investment.
3.  **Customer Concentration:** A significant portion of revenue may be derived from a few large customers. The loss of any of these key customers could materially impact financial results.
4.  **Operational Risks:** Offshore operations are complex and subject to weather, equipment failure, and regulatory risks, which can lead to project delays and cost overruns.
5.  **Debt and Capital Intensity:** The business is capital intensive, requiring significant investment in vessels and equipment. The level of debt could pose risks in a downturn.
