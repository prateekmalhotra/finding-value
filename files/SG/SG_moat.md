---

### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Sweetgreen's network effects are minimal and primarily reside within its owned digital platform and loyalty program. While digital ordering comprised 60.8% of revenue in Q2 2025, the transition to a new loyalty program created a "250 basis point headwind to same store sales," suggesting the network is not strong enough to retain customers through a change. The value proposition is primarily the food, not the network of users.
**Evidence:**
*   Total Digital Revenue was 60.8% of total revenue in the second quarter of 2025.
*   The transition to the new SG Rewards loyalty program created a 250 basis point headwind to same-store sales in Q2 2025.
*   In fiscal year 2024, 56% of revenue was derived from digital channels.
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for customers are exceptionally low, typical for the fast-casual restaurant industry. While the Sweetgreen app and loyalty program aim to create behavioral lock-in, the recent negative impact of a loyalty program change demonstrates that customers can and will easily switch to competitors. There are no contractual, technical, or financial barriers preventing customers from choosing another lunch option.
**Evidence:**
*   The transition of the new loyalty program contributed to a same-store sales decline of 7.6% in Q2 2025.
*   There is no evidence of contractual lock-in or costs associated with switching to a competitor. The industry is characterized by intense competition and low customer loyalty.
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Sweetgreen is experiencing cost pressures and margin contraction, indicating a lack of a durable cost advantage. Restaurant-level profit margin decreased from 22.5% to 18.9% year-over-year in Q2 2025, citing sales deleverage and tariff impacts. While the "Infinite Kitchen" automation shows promise for future labor savings, it is still in the early stages of deployment (20 planned for 2025) and has not yet translated to a company-wide, structural cost advantage over peers.
**Evidence:**
*   Restaurant-level profit margin for Q2 2025 was 18.9%, a contraction from 22.5% in the prior year's period.
*   Food, beverage, and packaging costs were 27.7% of revenue for Q2 2025, impacted by a 40 basis point increase from tariffs.
*   The Infinite Kitchen model is delivering significant labor savings in the locations where it is deployed.
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** Sweetgreen has a recognized brand associated with healthy, premium, and convenient food, particularly among urban professionals. However, this brand strength has not been sufficient to prevent negative same-store sales amidst a more cautious consumer environment. The company holds a few patents related to the Spyce acquisition, but these are not central to its core value proposition and do not represent a significant competitive barrier.
**Evidence:**
*   The company has a brand vision to become as ubiquitous as traditional fast food, offering transparency and quality.
*   As a result of the Spyce acquisition, the company has two issued patents and five pending applications in the United States.
*   Despite brand efforts, the company experienced a same-store sales decline of 7.6% in Q2 2025, citing a "cautious consumer environment."
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** With 260 locations as of Q2 2025, Sweetgreen has achieved a degree of scale but lacks the national density of larger competitors. Its "data-driven" real estate selection process is a standard industry practice. While it is expanding into new markets, the current footprint is not large enough to create significant barriers to entry or provide an overwhelming convenience advantage in most of the country.
**Evidence:**
*   The company ended Q2 2025 with 260 restaurants, after 9 net new openings in the quarter.
*   Sweetgreen plans to open at least 40 new restaurants in 2025 and enter 4 new markets.
*   As of December 29, 2024, the company operated 246 restaurants across 22 states and Washington, D.C.
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** Sweetgreen collects significant customer data through its digital channels, which accounted for 60.8% of Q2 2025 revenue. However, there is limited specific evidence demonstrating a clear feedback loop where this data leads to durable product improvements or increased retention that competitors cannot replicate. While data is used for real estate selection and likely marketing, a sustainable moat based on proprietary data has not been established.
**Evidence:**
*   Total Digital Revenue Percentage was 60.8% and Owned Digital Revenue Percentage was 33.4% in Q2 2025.
*   The company uses a data-driven real estate selection process.
*   The company aims to convert marketplace customers (e.g., Uber Eats) to its own digital platform, suggesting a desire to capture more first-party data.
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Sweetgreen does not operate an ecosystem or platform model. It is a restaurant that utilizes third-party delivery services (Marketplace Channel) as a sales channel. There is no evidence of third-party developers, complementary product marketplaces, or other platform characteristics that would create a competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The company operates a five-channel model, including its own digital channels and third-party marketplace channels.
*   There is no mention of third-party integrations or a developer ecosystem in the reviewed financial reports.
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The restaurant industry has no significant regulatory or legal barriers to entry beyond standard food safety, labor, and business licensing requirements that apply to all participants. Sweetgreen holds no unique licenses or government-granted protections that would deter competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   There is no evidence in the reviewed financial reports of any special licenses, patents, or regulatory approvals that would create a barrier to competition in the restaurant industry.
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** Opening a new restaurant requires significant capital expenditure for build-out and equipment, which can deter smaller entrants. Sweetgreen is investing heavily in its "Infinite Kitchen" automation technology, a specific asset that could be difficult and costly for competitors to replicate quickly. However, the capital intensity required for expansion also acts as a drag on profitability and cash flow.
**Evidence:**
*   The company plans to open at least 40 new restaurants in fiscal 2025, with 20 featuring the capital-intensive Infinite Kitchen technology.
*   The company is making significant investments in technology, including the deployment of Infinite Kitchen automation.
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** As a direct-to-consumer restaurant business, Sweetgreen has no long-term customer contracts or recurring revenue in the traditional sense. Revenue is transactional and lacks visibility. The "Sweetpass" subscription service is a step towards creating recurring revenue, but its contribution is not material enough to be disclosed separately in financial results.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is based on individual, non-contractual customer transactions.
*   The loyalty program transition negatively impacted sales, showing revenue is not guaranteed or recurring.
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (1 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (0 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.15 + 0.30 + 0.24 + 0.20 + 0.10 + 0 + 0 + 0.08 + 0 = 1.25
*   **Final Weighted Score:** 12.5 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   The weighted score of 12.5 falls within the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range.
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 1 / 5.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is very short, approximately 2–4 years. This narrow moat is predicated entirely on a premium brand perception and the early stages of a potential cost advantage through automation. There are no significant switching costs, network effects, or regulatory barriers to prevent erosion. The brand's strength is already showing weakness in the face of a "cautious consumer," and any potential cost advantage from the Infinite Kitchen is still several years from being realized at scale, by which time competitors may have developed similar solutions.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Brand Dilution:** Increased competition from both established players (e.g., Chipotle) and new health-focused startups could erode Sweetgreen's premium perception, forcing it to compete more directly on price and compressing margins further.
2.  **Failure to Scale Automation:** If the Infinite Kitchen technology fails to deliver its promised labor savings at scale, or if implementation costs and timelines exceed expectations, the potential future cost advantage will not materialize, leaving the company with high capital costs and no offsetting efficiency gains.
3.  **Sustained Consumer Trade-Down:** A prolonged period of economic weakness could lead to a permanent shift in consumer behavior away from premium, high-priced lunch options, directly impacting Sweetgreen's revenue and profitability as seen in the Q2 2025 results.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Same-Store Sales Growth:** A return to sustained positive growth would indicate strengthening brand appeal and customer loyalty.
*   **Restaurant-Level Profit Margin:** An expansion of this margin, particularly in Infinite Kitchen locations, would provide the first evidence of a developing cost advantage.
*   **Owned Digital Revenue %:** An increase in this metric suggests a growing direct relationship with customers, which is key for data collection and reducing reliance on third-party marketplaces.
*   **Customer Traffic:** Monitoring the traffic component of same-store sales to see if it turns positive, independent of price increases.
*   **New Restaurant AUV (Average Unit Volume):** A high and stable AUV for new stores would indicate successful site selection and brand acceptance in new markets.
*   **Pace of Infinite Kitchen Rollout:** Tracking whether the company meets its targets for deploying this potentially transformative technology.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Sweetgreen currently possesses a very narrow moat, justifying a 1/5 rating. Its primary asset is a trendy brand that commands a price premium, but this has proven fragile in a challenging consumer environment, as evidenced by recent negative same-store sales. The company's strategic bet on the "Infinite Kitchen" automation shows promise for a future cost advantage, but it is too early in its deployment to be considered a durable moat source. With negligible switching costs, no network effects, and intense competition, the company's current competitive advantages are tenuous and could be eroded within a few years. A rating increase would require sustained positive same-store sales growth and clear evidence of margin expansion driven by scalable technology advantages.

moat rating is 1 / 5
