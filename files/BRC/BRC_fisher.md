**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady Corporation serves a diverse range of industries with a broad portfolio of identification, safety, and compliance products. The company's strategy focuses on expanding into higher-growth adjacent markets and developing technologically advanced products. Recent acquisitions underscore this strategy: Gravotech (engraving and marking solutions), AB&R (asset tracking and inventory management), and Microfluidic Solutions (inkjet technologies) open up new avenues for growth in high-tech sectors.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady's commitment to ongoing development is evidenced by its consistent and increasing investment in research and development. R&D expenses rose from $58.5 million in fiscal 2022 to $67.7 million in fiscal 2024, representing 5.1% of net sales in 2024. This trend has continued into fiscal 2025, with R&D spending increasing further, partly due to the acquisition of Gravotech and an increase in R&D headcount. The company's R&D efforts are focused on high-growth areas such as track and trace applications, printing systems, and software. Management has clearly stated that a key initiative for fiscal 2025 is investing in organic growth by enhancing the R&D process.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was 5.1% in fiscal 2024. While direct competitor comparisons are difficult due to the fragmented nature of Brady's markets, this level of investment appears healthy.

The company's ability to maintain strong gross margins (51.3% in fiscal 2024) suggests that its R&D is producing differentiated, high-value products.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady has a strong balance sheet and generates healthy cash flow from operations, which was $255.1 million in fiscal 2024. The company has a share repurchase program in place, indicating that it is returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them. As of July 31, 2024, the company had authorized the repurchase of an additional $100.0 million of its Class A Nonvoting Common Stock. Recent acquisitions have been funded through cash on hand and borrowings under its existing credit facility, not through the issuance of equity.

**Synthesis:**
Brady Corporation scores very highly on Fisher's 15-point checklist, meeting all criteria for a long-term investment. The company's strengths lie in its diverse product portfolio with a long runway for growth, a strong commitment to R&D and innovation, and a solid financial position with healthy profit margins. The management team appears to be experienced, transparent, and focused on long-term value creation. The key variables that could influence the score in the next 12-24 months will be the successful integration of its recent acquisitions and the continued performance of its R&D pipeline in launching new, high-value products. A significant downturn in the global industrial economy could also impact the company's growth trajectory. A shift away from investment in R&D or a large, dilutive acquisition would be the most likely events to turn a "Yes" to a "No".

fisher score is 15 / 15
