### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**
A review of recent press releases and investor relations materials did not yield specific, forward-looking quantitative guidance for revenue, margins, or capex. The company typically reports historical results without providing an explicit future outlook. Therefore, guidance must be inferred from historical performance and management commentary.

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Lacking management guidance, a 3-year historical revenue CAGR is used. Fiscal year revenues were $130.79M (FY23), $138.61M (FY24), and $148.18M (FY25). This results in a 3-year CAGR of approximately 6.5%. A **base-case revenue growth rate of 5.0%** is conservatively assumed for the next five years, reflecting modest growth. (StockAnalysis, Aug 8, 2025)
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 23.63%. The operating margins for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were 24.63%, 23.45%, and 26.34%, respectively. The 3-year average is 24.8%. The model will use a stable **24.0% operating margin** to be conservative. (StockAnalysis, Aug 8, 2025)
*   **Tax Rate:** The TTM effective tax rate is 26.55%. The rates for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 were 26.66%, 28.54%, and 26.79%. The 3-year average is 27.3%. A **27.0% effective tax rate** is assumed going forward. (StockAnalysis, Aug 8, 2025)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM capex was $0.30M, or about 0.2% of revenue. The 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 0.3%. The model assumes capex will be **0.3% of revenue**. (StockAnalysis, Aug 8, 2025)
    *   **Working Capital:** The TTM change in working capital was -$6.18M. Given its volatility, it will be modeled as a percentage of incremental revenue. The historical average is assumed to be **5.0% of the change in revenue**. (StockAnalysis, Aug 8, 2025)
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-based compensation will be subtracted from FCFF. It is projected at the TTM level of **$1.09 million annually**. (StockAnalysis, Aug 8, 2025)
    *   The final share count will use the latest reported diluted weighted-average shares of **4.10 million**. (StockAnalysis, Aug 8, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**FCFF Formula:**
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $157.93 | $165.83 | $174.12 | $182.83 | $191.97 |
| EBIT (24.0% margin) | $37.90 | $39.80 | $41.79 | $43.88 | $46.07 |
| Tax (27.0%) | ($10.23) | ($10.74) | ($11.28) | ($11.85) | ($12.44) |
| **NOPAT** | **$27.67** | **$29.05** | **$30.51** | **$32.03** | **$33.63** |
| (+) D&A | $0.94 | $0.94 | $0.94 | $0.94 | $0.94 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | ($1.09) | ($1.09) | ($1.09) | ($1.09) | ($1.09) |
| (-) Capex (0.3% of Rev) | ($0.47) | ($0.50) | ($0.52) | ($0.55) | ($0.58) |
| (-) Chg. in WC (5% of rev chg) | ($0.38) | ($0.39) | ($0.41) | ($0.44) | ($0.46) |
| **FCFF** | **$26.67** | **$28.01** | **$29.42** | **$30.90** | **$32.45** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.31% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. This is a standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta (Î²):** 0.37 (5-Year Monthly). This low beta reflects the company's historically lower volatility compared to the broader market, suitable for a stable consumer staples business. (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.31% + 0.37 * 5.0% = 6.16%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense (TTM): $3.80M
    *   Total Debt: $54.89M
    *   **Pre-tax Cost of Debt = $3.80M / $54.89M = 6.92%**
    *   **After-tax Cost of Debt = 6.92% * (1 - 27.0%) = 5.05%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Capitalization (Equity): $406.31M (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025)
    *   Market Value of Debt: $54.89M
    *   Total Capital = $406.31M + $54.89M = $461.20M
    *   **WACC = (E/(E+D)) * CoE + (D/(E+D)) * CoD * (1-t)**
    *   **WACC = ($406.31/$461.20) * 6.16% + ($54.89/$461.20) * 5.05% = 5.43% + 0.60% = 6.03%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   **Terminal Value = ($32.45 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0603 - 0.025) = $33.26 / 0.0353 = $942.2 M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + D&A = $46.07M + $0.94M = $47.01M
    *   A conservative 10x EV/EBITDA multiple is assumed, in line with historical industry averages for stable restaurant/franchise businesses.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $47.01M * 10 = $470.1M**
    *   Given the significant discrepancy, the more conservative **Exit Multiple method's terminal value of $470.1M** is used to ground the valuation in caution.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: ($26.67/1.0603^1) + ($28.01/1.0603^2) + ($29.42/1.0603^3) + ($30.90/1.0603^4) + ($32.45/1.0603^5) = $25.15 + $24.89 + $24.64 + $24.39 + $24.16 = **$123.23M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $470.1M / (1.0603^5) = **$351.04M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $123.23M + $351.04M = $474.27M**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $54.89M - $26.87M = $28.02M
    *   **Equity Value = $474.27M - $28.02M = $446.25M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding**
    *   **Fair Value per Share = $446.25M / 4.10M = $108.84**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$108.84**. Assumes 5.0% revenue growth and 24.0% operating margin.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$85.00**. Assumes 3.0% revenue growth, 22.0% operating margin, and a 9x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$130.00**. Assumes 6.5% revenue growth, 25.0% operating margin, and an 11x exit multiple.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a margin of safety.
    *   **MOS Price = $108.84 * (1 - 0.30) = $76.19**

### **Risk Notes**
The key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Margin Pressure:** The business is sensitive to commodity price fluctuations (especially beef), which could compress operating margins if costs cannot be passed on to customers. 2) **Brand Dependency:** The company relies heavily on the strength of the Nathan's Famous brand and its licensing agreement with Smithfield Foods. Any damage to the brand or disruption in this key partnership would significantly impact high-margin royalty revenue. 3) **Competition:** The foodservice and packaged goods industries are highly competitive, posing a constant threat to market share and pricing power.

final answer is 108.84 $
