### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Accelerated Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has an active share repurchase program, which was increased by $500 million on January 27, 2025. As of March 29, 2025, there was $718 million available for future repurchases.
*   **Mechanism:** An accelerated share repurchase program would reduce the number of outstanding shares, which would in turn increase earnings per share (EPS). Higher EPS is often a driver of a higher stock price, as it signals to investors that the company is confident in its future earnings and is returning value to shareholders.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $300 million of shares at an average price of $70 per share, resulting in the repurchase of approximately 4.3 million shares.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $500 million of shares at an average price of $70 per share, resulting in the repurchase of approximately 7.1 million shares.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases the full $718 million available at an average price of $70 per share, resulting in the repurchase of approximately 10.3 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). The repurchase of a significant number of shares would increase EPS and could lead to a modest increase in the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a history of share repurchases and has a significant amount authorized for future repurchases.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price must be at a level that management deems attractive for repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity.
    *   Announcements of any new or increased repurchase authorizations.
    *   The company's stock price.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   The company could decide to use its cash for other purposes, such as acquisitions.
    *   A downturn in the company's business could lead to a reduction in share repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Investors should monitor the company's share repurchase activity and be prepared to buy on any dips in the stock price.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Successful Integration of TriMed and other acquisitions

*   **Type:** M&A/Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company acquired a 60% interest in TriMed, a global developer of orthopedic solutions, on April 1, 2024, for $315 million. The company is in the process of integrating this and other recent acquisitions.
*   **Mechanism:** The successful integration of TriMed and other acquisitions would lead to revenue and cost synergies, which would in turn increase the company's earnings. The market would likely react positively to evidence of successful integration, such as strong revenue growth in the acquired businesses and the realization of cost savings.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company realizes $10 million in cost synergies and $50 million in revenue synergies from the TriMed acquisition in the first year.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company realizes $20 million in cost synergies and $100 million in revenue synergies from the TriMed acquisition in the first year.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company realizes $30 million in cost synergies and $150 million in revenue synergies from the TriMed acquisition in the first year.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (5-15%). The successful integration of TriMed and other acquisitions would be a significant driver of earnings growth and could lead to a material increase in the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has a history of successful acquisitions, but there is always execution risk involved in integrating new businesses.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must be able to successfully integrate the operations of TriMed and other acquired businesses.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Revenue growth in the company's Global Specialty Products segment.
