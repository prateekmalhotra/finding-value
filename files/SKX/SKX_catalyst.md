### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Skechers has an active share repurchase program with $789.9 million remaining as of June 30, 2025, under the $1.0 billion authorization announced on July 25, 2024. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, which is a positive signal to investors.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** The current repurchase program expires on July 25, 2027. The bulk of the remaining authorization could be executed within the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company repurchases $200 million worth of shares. At an average price of $70/share, this would be ~2.86 million shares, or ~1.9% of shares outstanding.
    *   **Base Case:** The company repurchases $400 million worth of shares. At an average price of $70/share, this would be ~5.71 million shares, or ~3.8% of shares outstanding.
    *   **High Case:** The company repurchases $600 million worth of shares. At an average price of $70/share, this would be ~8.57 million shares, or ~5.7% of shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small-Medium (5-15%). The repurchase program provides a direct return of capital to shareholders and can create a floor for the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has a history of executing on its repurchase authorizations and the current program is a key part of its capital allocation strategy.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's cash flow generation must remain strong to fund the repurchases. The stock price must remain at a level that management deems attractive for buybacks.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports (10-Q) will detail the number of shares repurchased. Monitor the company's free cash flow to assess its ability to fund the program.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in the business could force the company to preserve cash and suspend the repurchase program. A rapid increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The share repurchase program provides a clear and tangible catalyst for shareholder value creation in the near term.

**2. Catalyst Title:** International Growth, Particularly in EMEA
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Skechers is experiencing rapid growth in its international markets, with the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region being a standout performer. In the second quarter of 2025, EMEA wholesale sales grew by an impressive 58.7%.
*   **Mechanism:** Continued strong growth in international markets will drive top-line revenue growth and margin expansion. As international markets mature, they will contribute a larger portion of the company's overall profits.
*   **Timing:** Near-term (0-12 months) and ongoing.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** International sales growth slows to 10% for the full year.
    *   **Base Case:** International sales grow by 15-20% for the full year, in line with recent trends.
    *   **High Case:** International sales growth accelerates to 25%+ for the full year, driven by continued strength in EMEA.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%). International growth is a key driver of the company's overall growth story and a significant contributor to its future earnings potential.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has a proven track record of successful international expansion and the current momentum in EMEA is a strong indicator of future growth.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The global economic environment must remain stable, particularly in key international markets. The company must continue to effectively manage its international supply chain and distribution network.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly earnings reports will provide detailed breakdowns of sales by geographic region. Monitor economic data from key international markets.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A global recession or a significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar could negatively impact international sales. Increased competition in key international markets could also pose a risk.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The strong international growth, particularly in EMEA, is a key differentiator for Skechers and a significant driver of future shareholder value.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) Channel Expansion
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Skechers is actively expanding its Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) business, which includes company-owned retail stores and e-commerce platforms. DTC sales increased by 11.0% in Q2 2025, and the company continues to open new stores globally.
*   **Mechanism:** Expanding the DTC channel allows Skechers to capture a higher gross margin per sale, as it eliminates the wholesale middleman. It also gives the company greater control over its brand image and the customer experience.
*   **Timing:** Long-term (12-60 months) and ongoing.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** DTC sales growth slows to 5-7% annually.
    *   **Base Case:** DTC sales grow by 10-15% annually, in line with recent trends and store opening plans.
    *   **High Case:** DTC sales growth accelerates to 20%+ annually, driven by strong e-commerce growth and successful new store openings.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium-Large (15-35%). A successful expansion of the DTC channel will lead to higher gross margins and a more direct relationship with consumers, both of which are key drivers of long-term shareholder value.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a clear strategy for DTC expansion and has been successfully executing on it for several years.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must continue to invest in its e-commerce platform and its physical retail footprint. The consumer preference for DTC channels must continue to grow.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly earnings reports will provide a breakdown of sales by channel (wholesale vs. DTC). Monitor the number of new store openings and the growth of the company's e-commerce business.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A shift in consumer preference away from DTC channels could negatively impact this growth strategy. The high fixed costs associated with retail stores could become a drag on profitability if sales decline.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The long-term expansion of the DTC channel is a key part of the Skechers growth story and a significant driver of future profitability.

### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program Execution**

*   **Formula:** Estimated Price = (Current Market Cap / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) * (Current Stock Price / (Current Market Cap / Shares Outstanding))
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Shares Outstanding: 150.3 million (130.9M Class A + 19.4M Class B)
    *   Current Stock Price: $70 (assumed)
    *   Current Market Cap: $10.52 billion
    *   Shares Repurchased (Base Case): 5.71 million
*   **Calculation:** Estimated Price = ($10.52B / (150.3M - 5.71M)) * ($70 / ($10.52B / 150.3M)) = **$72.77** (a 4.0% increase)

**2. International Growth**

*   **Formula:** Estimated Price = (Current Sales * (1 + Blended Growth Rate)) * (Profit Margin) * (P/E Multiple) / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Sales: $8.97 billion
    *   International Sales Weight: 60%
    *   Domestic Sales Weight: 40%
    *   International Growth Rate (Base Case): 18%
    *   Domestic Growth Rate: 5%
    *   Profit Margin: 8.5%
    *   P/E Multiple: 15x
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Blended Growth Rate = (0.60 * 0.18) + (0.40 * 0.05) = 12.8%
    *   Estimated Sales = $8.97B * (1 + 0.128) = $10.12B
    *   Estimated Net Income = $10.12B * 0.085 = $860M
    *   Estimated Market Cap = $860M * 15 = $12.9B
    *   Estimated Price = $12.9B / 150.3M = **$85.83** (a 22.6% increase)

### **Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**
