Synthesis: Lennox International appears to be a high-quality company that scores well on the majority of Fisher's 15 points. The company's strengths lie in its strong market position, commitment to innovation, and solid financial performance. The biggest factor that could change this score in the next 12-24 months would be a significant downturn in the housing or construction markets, which would impact demand for their products. Additionally, increased competition or a failure to execute on their new product roadmap could also negatively impact their score. To turn any of the "Yes" answers to a "No," one would need to see a significant and sustained decline in market share, a drop in profitability, or a major strategic misstep.

fisher score is 15 / 15
