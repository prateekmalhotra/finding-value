### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** DGD Margin Recovery and SAF Production Ramp-up
*   **Type:** Operational / Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) joint venture completed a project in November 2024 to upgrade approximately 50% of the Port Arthur plant's 470 million gallon annual capacity to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). A recovery in renewable diesel margins from current challenging levels and a successful ramp-up of higher-margin SAF sales would significantly boost earnings.
*   **Mechanism:** Higher margins on renewable diesel and a shift to premium-priced SAF would directly increase the "Equity in net income of Diamond Green Diesel" line item, which is a major contributor to Darling's operating income. This would lead to higher EPS and likely a higher stock valuation.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026. Management expects momentum to build throughout 2025 as DGD turnarounds are completed and SAF sales increase.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** DGD EBITDA per gallon remains depressed at ~$0.40. Darling's share of DGD EBITDA remains around Q2 2025 levels (~$42.6M/quarter).
    *   **Base Scenario:** DGD EBITDA per gallon recovers to ~$0.75. Darling's share of DGD EBITDA increases by ~$80M per quarter. (Inference based on historical DGD performance)
    *   **High Scenario:** DGD EBITDA per gallon recovers to >$1.00, driven by strong SAF demand and favorable regulatory environment. Darling's share of DGD EBITDA could exceed an additional $150M per quarter. (Inference)
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). DGD is the single largest driver of Darling's profitability. A significant recovery in its earnings power would likely lead to a major re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The SAF facility is operational, but margin recovery is dependent on volatile commodity prices and regulatory factors (e.g., the new Clean Fuel Production Credit).
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Favorable implementation and value realization from the Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC), strengthening of renewable diesel margins, and securing of profitable SAF offtake agreements.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   DGD's reported EBITDA per gallon (disclosed quarterly).
    *   Management commentary on SAF production volumes and pricing.
    *   RIN and LCFS credit pricing.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Sustained low renewable diesel margins.
    *   Regulatory uncertainty or unfavorable changes to the CFPC.
    *   Slower-than-expected ramp-up of SAF sales.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The potential upside is significant, but near-term headwinds in the fuel segment warrant caution until clear signs of margin recovery emerge.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Margin Improvement in Feed Ingredients Segment
*   **Type:** Financial / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Feed Ingredients segment, Darling's largest by revenue, is benefiting from rising fat prices, which should lead to improved gross margins. Management expects this trend to continue, providing a lift to earnings in the near term.
*   **Mechanism:** Higher finished product prices for fats, a key output of the Feed segment, directly translate to higher revenue and gross profit, assuming raw material costs (which are often formula-based) lag or do not rise as quickly. This boosts segment operating income and overall EPS.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – February 2026. The impact of rising fat prices was already being seen in Q2 2025 and is expected to continue.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Fat prices stabilize or decline, keeping gross margin percentage around the 22.9% seen in Q2 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Fat prices continue to rise, leading to a 1-2 percentage point improvement in the Feed segment's gross margin. On ~$936.5M of quarterly segment revenue, this would translate to an additional ~$9.4M - $18.7M in quarterly gross profit.
    *   **High Scenario:** A sharp increase in fat prices drives a >3 percentage point improvement in gross margin, adding over $28M in quarterly gross profit.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–30%). As the largest segment, a sustained margin improvement here would have a noticeable impact on the bottom line.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. Management has explicitly stated that rising fat prices are providing a lift.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strength in global fat and grease prices.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Jacobsen prices for Bleachable Fancy Tallow (BFT) and Yellow Grease (YG).
    *   Feed Ingredients segment gross margin percentage (reported quarterly).
    *   Management commentary on fat and protein price trends.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A sudden reversal in fat commodity prices.
    *   Weakness in protein prices, which could offset some of the gains from fats.
    *   Increased competition for raw materials, driving up input costs.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is a near-term, high-probability catalyst that appears to be already in motion.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Execution of Share Repurchase Program
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Board of Directors extended the share repurchase program in June 2024, refreshing the authorization to $500 million, valid until August 2026. As of December 28, 2024, approximately $494.9 million remained under the program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). It also signals management's confidence that the stock is undervalued and can provide support for the stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026. The program is active, but the pace of execution is at management's discretion.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Minimal repurchases as cash flow is directed to debt reduction, as per Q2 2025 commentary.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $150 million of stock over the next 12 months. At a share price of ~$34, this would retire ~4.4 million shares, or ~2.8% of shares outstanding.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company accelerates repurchases, utilizing the full remaining ~$495 million authorization. This would retire ~14.5 million shares, or ~9.2% of shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (~0–10%). While positive, the impact will be muted if the pace is slow due to the focus on debt reduction. A more aggressive buyback could have a medium impact.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80% (that some repurchases will occur); 30% (that the full amount will be utilized in the near-term). Management has stated debt reduction is the priority in 2025.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Generation of sufficient free cash flow to both reduce debt and repurchase shares.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" in 10-Q/10-K filings.
    *   Management commentary on capital allocation priorities.
    *   Company leverage ratio.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Weaker than expected cash flow generation could halt the buyback.
    *   Management may choose to prioritize debt paydown exclusively.
    *   Significant insider selling, as seen in August 2025, could signal a lack of confidence and offset the positive signal of a buyback.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The authorization is in place, but the near-term pace is uncertain.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Successful Launch and Growth of Nextida Joint Venture
*   **Type:** Partnership / Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Darling has launched Nextida, a new joint venture with Tessenderlo Group, to combine their collagen and gelatin segments. This move is aimed at creating a global leader in the high-margin health and wellness sector.
*   **Mechanism:** By spinning off and combining these assets, Darling creates a more focused company in a high-growth, high-margin market. This could lead to a higher valuation for the new entity, which would be reflected in the value of Darling's stake, and allows Darling to focus on its core operations.
*   **Timing:** 12–36 months. The joint venture was announced in 2025, and it will take time to integrate operations and realize synergies.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **P&L/FCF Impact:** A successful Nextida could command EBITDA margins in the 20-25% range, significantly higher than Darling's consolidated average. If Nextida achieves $500M in revenue, this could contribute $125M in EBITDA (Darling's share would be 50%, or $62.5M). (Inference)
    *   **Valuation Linkage:** Health and wellness ingredient companies often trade at higher multiples (e.g., 15-20x EBITDA) than rendering companies. A successful Nextida could be valued at a premium, creating significant value for Darling's shareholders.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–30%). The creation of a high-multiple, focused entity could unlock significant value.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The JV has been announced, but execution and integration risks remain.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful integration of the two companies' assets, realization of cost and revenue synergies, and strong execution in the health and wellness market.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Financial performance of Nextida (once public or disclosed).
    *   New product launches from Nextida.
    *   Market share gains in the collagen and gelatin markets.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Integration challenges and failure to realize synergies.
    *   Increased competition in the health and wellness ingredients space.
    *   Changes in consumer preferences away from animal-based collagens.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is a promising strategic move that diversifies the business and has the potential to unlock significant long-term value.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. DGD Margin Recovery**
*   **Formula:** Change in DAR Share Price = (Change in DAR's Share of DGD Net Income) \* (DAR's P/E Multiple) / (DAR's Shares Outstanding)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   DAR's P/E Multiple: 12x (conservative, based on current trading)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 158.9 million (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
    *   Annualized increase in DAR's share of DGD Net Income: $320M (Base Scenario: $80M/quarter increase)
*   **Calculation:** ($320,000,000 \* 12) / 158,900,000 = **$24.17 per share potential increase.**
*   **Citation:** Shares outstanding from 10-K, Feb 25, 2025. P/E multiple is an inference. DGD income increase is an inference based on historical performance.

**2. Feed Ingredient Margin Improvement**
*   **Formula:** Change in DAR Share Price = (Annualized Increase in Feed Segment Operating Income) \* (1 - Tax Rate) \* (P/E Multiple) / (Shares Outstanding)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Annualized increase in Feed Segment Gross Profit: $56M (Base Scenario: $14M/quarter)
    *   Tax Rate: 22% (inference based on Q2 2025 effective tax rate)
    *   P/E Multiple: 12x
    *   Shares Outstanding: 158.9 million
*   **Calculation:** ($56,000,000 \* (1 - 0.22) \* 12) / 158,900,000 = **$3.28 per share potential increase.**
*   **Citation:** Base scenario calculation and tax rate based on Q2 2025 earnings call transcript.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term (0-12 months) catalyst balance for Darling Ingredients is cautiously positive. The primary positive driver is the margin improvement in the core Feed Ingredients segment, which is already underway due to rising fat prices. However, this is tempered by significant near-term headwinds in the Fuel Ingredients segment, where the key DGD joint venture is facing margin pressure and a planned maintenance turnaround in Q3 2025. The recently refreshed share buyback program provides a supportive floor, but its impact is likely to be muted by the company's stated priority of debt reduction. Overall, the short-term market signal is mixed, with the positive developments in the core business fighting against the challenges in the high-impact DGD venture. A recovery in renewable diesel margins is the key swing factor that could turn the signal decisively positive.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Sustained Collapse in Renewable Diesel Margins:** A prolonged period of low profitability at DGD, driven by unfavorable commodity spreads or regulatory changes, would overwhelm positives in other segments and severely impact Darling's earnings and cash flow. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Jul 24, 2025)
2.  **Global Recession:** A significant global economic downturn would reduce demand for meat and food products, lowering raw material volumes for Darling, and would also likely depress fuel and feed prices, negatively impacting all segments. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
3.  **Adverse Regulatory Changes to Biofuel Mandates:** Any significant rollback or negative alteration of the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), LCFS, or the new Clean Fuel Production Credit (CFPC) would directly and materially harm the profitability of the DGD joint venture. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on this analysis, the recommendation is to **Watch** Darling Ingredients. The most significant catalyst, a recovery in the DGD joint venture's profitability, offers substantial upside potential of over 30%, but its timing remains uncertain due to near-term margin headwinds. The most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly reported EBITDA per gallon for DGD, as a return to historical norms would signal a powerful earnings recovery and a compelling entry point.

catalyst score is 3 / 5
