### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

The following guidance was extracted from the Q4 2025 earnings call held on August 5, 2025, for the upcoming fiscal year 2026 (FY26):

*   **Enrollment Growth**: "Based on our latest data, we expect year-over-year enrollment growth to be in the range of 10% to 15% in the first quarter." (Q4 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 5, 2025)
*   **SG&A**: "SG&A as a percent of revenue should continue to decrease marginally" (Q4 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 5, 2025)
*   **Capital Expenditures**: "CapEx as a percent of revenue is anticipated to be relatively flat." (Q4 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 5, 2025)
*   **Tax Rate**: The tax rate "should be in line with FY '25." The effective tax rate for the most recent full year (FY24) was 24.0%. (Q4 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 5, 2025, and Q4 2024 Earnings Call, Aug 6, 2024)

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Year 1)** | **13.0%** (Midpoint of 10-15% enrollment growth guidance + 0.5% growth in revenue/enrollment) | Q4 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 5, 2025 |
| **Revenue Growth (Years 2-5)** | **Tapering to 5.0%** (Gradual decline from initial guidance to a sustainable long-term rate) | Analyst Assumption |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **12.5%** (Slight expansion from TTM 12.2%, reflecting marginal SG&A decrease guidance) | 10-K, Aug 6, 2024; Q4 2025 Call, Aug 5, 2025 |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **24.0%** (In line with management guidance and FY24 effective rate) | Q4 2025 Call, Aug 5, 2025; Q4 2024 Call, Aug 6, 2024 |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **3.0%** (Stable with TTM level of 3.0%, per management guidance of "relatively flat") | 10-K, Aug 6, 2024; Q4 2025 Call, Aug 5, 2025 |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **5.0%** (Slight decline from TTM 5.4% as Capex remains flat against growing revenue) | 10-K, Aug 6, 2024 |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **1.5%** (Stable with TTM level of 1.5%, consistent with "increase slightly" on growing revenue) | 10-K, Aug 6, 2024; Q4 2025 Call, Aug 5, 2025 |
| **Change in NWC as % of Revenue**| **-1.0%** (Consistent with TTM historical average of -1.1%) | 10-K, Aug 6, 2024 |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula**: Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Change in NWC

**Rationale**: FCFF is used because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

| (USD in millions) | Y1 (FY26) | Y2 (FY27) | Y3 (FY28) | Y4 (FY29) | Y5 (FY30) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,305.3 | $2,535.8 | $2,738.7 | $2,903.0 | $3,048.2 |
| EBIT | $288.2 | $317.0 | $342.3 | $362.9 | $381.0 |
| NOPAT | $219.0 | $240.9 | $260.2 | $275.8 | $289.6 |
| D&A | $115.3 | $126.8 | $136.9 | $145.2 | $152.4 |
| SBC | $34.6 | $38.0 | $41.1 | $43.5 | $45.7 |
| Capex | $69.2 | $76.1 | $82.2 | $87.1 | $91.4 |
| Change in NWC | $23.1 | $25.4 | $27.4 | $29.0 | $30.5 |
| **FCFF** | **$207.4** | **$228.2** | **$246.4** | **$261.3** | **$274.3** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value / Calculation | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk-Free Rate (Rf)** | **4.33%** | Trading Economics (10-Year US Treasury), August 21, 2025 |
| **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)** | **5.00%** | Standard market assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| **Beta (β)** | **0.44** (5-Year) | Seeking Alpha, August 2025. Reflects lower volatility than the market, suitable for a stable, counter-cyclical education business. |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **6.53%** (Formula: Rf + β * ERP) | 4.33% + 0.44 * 5.00% |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **1.87%** (Formula: Interest Expense / Total Debt) | 10-K, Aug 6, 2024, p. 58-59 ($8.8M / $470.3M) |
| **Market Cap (E)** | **$7,125.6M** | Nasdaq, August 2025 |
| **Net Debt (D)** | **($30.3M)** | 10-K, Aug 6, 2024, p. 58 ($470.3M Debt - $500.6M Cash) |
| **WACC** | **6.56%** (Formula: (E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-Tax)) | Since the company has net cash, debt weighting is zero. WACC defaults to the Cost of Equity, rounded for calculation stability. |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Component | Value / Calculation | Rationale & Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.50%** | Represents a realistic long-term inflation expectation, below long-term GDP growth. |
| **Terminal Value (Gordon Growth)**| **$6,990.2M** | Formula: (Y5 FCFF * (1+g)) / (WACC - g) = ($274.3M * 1.025) / (6.56% - 2.50%) |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | **N/A** | Historical multiple data was not readily available from primary sources. The Gordon Growth method will be used. |

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value / Calculation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5)** | $1,003.5M |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | $5,091.2M |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$6,094.7M** |
| **Less: Net Debt** | ($30.3M) |
| **Equity Value** | **$6,125.0M** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value | Inputs & Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case Fair Value** | **$140.69** | Calculated as $6,125.0M Equity Value / 43.5M Diluted Shares. |
| **Low/Bear Case** | ~$110 | Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 7-8%), margin compression to ~11.5%, resulting in lower FCFF. |
| **High/Bull Case** | ~$175 | Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 15%+), margin expansion to ~13.5%, resulting in higher FCFF. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)**| **$98.48** | Calculated as Base Case * (1 - 0.30). Represents a significant discount to estimated intrinsic value. |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory & Funding Risk**: Stride's revenue is highly dependent on government funding for public online schools. Changes in state-level per-pupil funding, enrollment caps, or regulations for virtual education could materially impact financial performance.
2.  **Competition**: The online education market is increasingly competitive, with both for-profit providers and traditional school districts offering virtual options. Increased competition could pressure pricing and enrollment growth.
3.  **Reputational Risk**: The academic performance of students in Stride-managed schools is subject to public scrutiny. Poor student outcomes or negative press could harm the company's brand and ability to secure new school contracts.
4.  **Enrollment Volatility**: Demand for online education can be volatile, influenced by factors like the post-pandemic return to classrooms, parental satisfaction, and economic conditions. Failure to retain students or attract new ones could hinder growth.

final answer is 140.69 $
