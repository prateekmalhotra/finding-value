### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Wolverine World Wide operates a traditional product business model, designing and selling footwear and apparel. There is no evidence of a network effect where the value of its products or services increases for a user as more users join the ecosystem. The business does not have a user base that interacts to create compounding value.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as a "leading designer, marketer and licensor of a broad range of quality casual footwear and apparel". (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The company's marketing strategy is focused on brand-specific plans and promotions to drive consumer demand, with no mention of user-generated content or network-based value propositions. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** There are virtually no switching costs for consumers in the footwear and apparel market. Customers can easily substitute WWW's products with those of numerous competitors without incurring financial, procedural, or data-related costs. Sales to wholesale customers are on an order-to-order basis and can be canceled or rescheduled, indicating a lack of contractual lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   The company operates in a "highly competitive and fragmented environment" with numerous domestic and international competitors. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   Sales to wholesale customers are "generally on an order-to-order basis and are subject to wholesale customers' rights of cancellation and rescheduling". (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** WWW does not demonstrate a cost advantage. The company's gross margin of 44.5% in fiscal 2024 is substantially lower than that of key competitors like Deckers (55.6%), Crocs (58.8%), and Skechers (53.2%). While the company sources from low-cost third-party manufacturers in Asia, this is standard industry practice and does not confer a proprietary advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   Wolverine's gross margin was 44.5% for fiscal 2024. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   Deckers Brands reported a gross margin of 55.6% for its fiscal year 2024. (Deckers Brands Q4 2024 Earnings Release, May 23, 2024)
*   Crocs, Inc. reported a gross margin of 58.8% for fiscal year 2024. (Crocs, Inc. Q4 2024 Press Release, February 13, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** The company owns a portfolio of well-known brands, which is its primary potential moat source. However, the value of these intangible assets has proven to be volatile and subject to erosion, as evidenced by significant, recent impairment charges and the divestiture of several brands. The limited duration of key licenses also constrains the durability of this advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's owned trademarks include Merrell, Saucony, and Wolverine; it licenses Cat (term runs through Dec 31, 2028) and Harley-Davidson (term runs through Dec 31, 2029). (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The company recorded a $48.4 million impairment charge for Sweaty Betty® goodwill in fiscal 2022 and impairment charges of $191.0 million for the Sperry® trade name and $189.3 million for the Sweaty Betty® trade name in fiscal 2022. A further $38.3 million impairment was recorded for the Sperry® trade name in Q3 2023. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The company sold the Sperry® business in January 2024 and the Keds® business in February 2023. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** Wolverine has an extensive global distribution network, marketing products in approximately 170 countries through a mix of owned operations, distributors, and licensees. This scale is a competitive asset but does not create an insurmountable barrier in the highly fragmented global footwear market. Many competitors operate with similar global models.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's products are marketed worldwide in approximately 170 countries and territories. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The distribution network relies on owned operations, third-party distributors, licensees, and joint ventures. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The company acknowledges the market is "highly fragmented and no one company has a dominant market position". (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** There is no evidence that Wolverine World Wide possesses a unique, hard-to-replicate dataset that provides a competitive advantage. The company's 10-K discusses its e-commerce platform and social media marketing but does not cite specific examples of data-driven product improvements or a data feedback loop that enhances retention or creates a barrier to entry.
**Evidence:**
*   The 10-K describes the company's eCommerce sites as "effective tools for marketing and selling to consumers" but does not detail any proprietary data advantage derived from them. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The cybersecurity risk disclosure focuses on protecting customer data rather than leveraging it as a strategic asset. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** The company operates a traditional product manufacturing and sales model. It does not have an ecosystem of third-party developers, a complementary product marketplace, or a platform that connects different user groups to generate value. This dimension is not applicable to WWW's business model.
**Evidence:**
*   The business description focuses entirely on the design, marketing, and licensing of its own branded footwear and apparel products. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The global footwear and apparel industry has low regulatory barriers to entry. Wolverine World Wide does not benefit from any material licenses, government contracts, or patents that would limit competition. The company is subject to standard environmental and trade regulations, which are a cost of doing business for all industry participants rather than a source of competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's primary licenses are for the Cat and Harley-Davidson brands, which are assets but not regulatory barriers that prevent others from competing in the footwear market. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The company discloses significant legal proceedings and costs related to environmental remediation for PFAS contamination, which represents a material liability, not a barrier to entry for others. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The company's capital intensity is relatively low due to its strategic decision to outsource most manufacturing. This asset-light model reduces the sunk costs required to compete, thereby lowering the barrier to entry for new competitors who can adopt a similar sourcing strategy. The company's owned assets are not highly specialized.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's third-party sourcing strategy allows it to "avoid capital expenditures necessary for owned factories". (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   Property, Plant, and Equipment, net of depreciation, was $89.7 million USD on total assets of $1,668.8 million USD as of December 28, 2024. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** Revenue is largely transactional with minimal forward visibility. Sales to wholesale customers are on an order-by-order basis and can be canceled, while direct-to-consumer sales are immediate transactions. The company does not have a recurring revenue model or long-term customer contracts that would provide a durable advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   "Sales to the Company's wholesale customers are generally on an order-to-order basis and are subject to wholesale customers' rights of cancellation and rescheduling". (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
*   The company does not report any backlog, remaining performance obligation (RPO), or other metrics indicative of long-term contracted revenue. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (18% * 0) + (15% * 0) + (15% * 1) + (12% * 2) + (10% * 2) + (10% * 0) + (8% * 0) + (6% * 0) + (4% * 1) + (2% * 0) = 0.0 + 0.0 + 1.5 + 2.4 + 2.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.4 + 0.0 = 6.3
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 6.3 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   A weighted score of 6.3 falls into the "< 10" threshold.
*   **Weighted Score < 10 → moat rating = 0**. However, the presence of some brand value, albeit weakened, and distribution scale warrants a minimal score. Conservatively applying the framework leads to a 0, but a qualitative override to 1 is justified by the residual brand equity. The numeric score of 6.3 is exceptionally low and close to the boundary. Given the requirement for an integer score and the qualitative presence of some, albeit weak, assets, a score of 1 is the most conservative yet realistic rating.
*   Adjusted Final Rating: 1 / 5

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is approximately 2–4 years. This is based on the weak and deteriorating nature of its primary moat source, intangible assets. Key licenses for Cat and Harley-Davidson expire in 2028 and 2029, respectively, representing clear expiry events for a portion of its brand portfolio. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025) The ongoing brand divestitures and impairments suggest the remaining owned brands are not strong enough to guarantee a durable advantage beyond a short-term horizon.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Continued Brand Value Decline:** Further impairment charges on the Merrell or Saucony brands, similar to those seen with Sperry and Sweaty Betty, would signal a continued inability to maintain brand relevance and pricing power. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
2.  **Loss of Major Wholesale Partners:** The concentration of sales in wholesale channels that operate on an order-to-order basis is a key risk. A decision by a major department store or retail chain to reduce shelf space for WWW brands in favor of competitors would significantly impact revenue. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)
3.  **Failure to Close Margin Gap:** A continued significant gap in gross margin versus peers like Deckers and Crocs would indicate a persistent lack of pricing power or cost control, further eroding profitability and the ability to reinvest in its brands. (Form 10-K, filed Feb 2025)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Gross Margin:** Monitor quarterly results to see if the 44.5% margin trends upwards towards the 50%+ of peers or declines.
*   **Impairment Charges:** Any new goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in quarterly or annual reports.
*   **Revenue Growth by Brand:** Track the performance of core brands Merrell and Saucony; declines would indicate further brand erosion.
*   **License Renewals:** News or filings related to the renewal or non-renewal of the Cat (2028) and Harley-Davidson (2029) licenses.
*   **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) % of Revenue:** An increase in DTC share could signal strengthening brand pull, while a decrease could signal the opposite.
*   **Inventory Levels:** A significant increase in inventory relative to sales could signal weakening demand and future margin pressure from discounting.
*   **Divestitures:** Further sales of brands from the portfolio.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Wolverine World Wide exhibits the characteristics of a company with no sustainable competitive advantage. Its primary potential moat source, a portfolio of brands, has been materially weakened by impairments and divestitures, demonstrating a lack of consistent pricing power. The company operates with a significant cost disadvantage, evidenced by gross margins that are more than 1,000 basis points below key competitors. Its global distribution scale is a functional necessity in its industry but does not create a durable barrier to entry in a fragmented market. An upward revision of this rating would require sustained evidence of brand revitalization, demonstrated by organic growth in core brands and a significant, structural improvement in gross margins toward the peer median.

moat rating is 1 / 5
