### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Vail Resorts' primary growth engine is the Epic Pass program, which provides access to its network of 41 resorts. The company is focused on growing the number of guests who purchase a pass in advance of the ski season.

Synthesis:
Vail Resorts scores well on Fisher's checklist, with its primary strengths being its strong competitive position, long-term growth strategy, and experienced management team. The company's Epic Pass program is a powerful engine for growth and creates a significant competitive advantage. The primary area of concern is labor relations, which could impact the company's ability to attract and retain talent. The score could be most impacted in the next 12-24 months by a significant downturn in the economy, which could reduce demand for leisure travel, or by increased competition in the ski industry. A "No" on labor relations could be changed to a "Yes" with evidence of improved employee satisfaction and a reduction in staff turnover.

fisher score is 14 / 15
