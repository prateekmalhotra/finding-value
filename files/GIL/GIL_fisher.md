### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

#### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan operates in the large, mature market for basic apparel. While organic growth is modest, the company's recently announced acquisition of HanesBrands Inc. significantly expands its market position and product portfolio. Management has provided a three-year outlook for the combined entity (2026-2028) forecasting a compound annual growth rate in net sales of 3-5%. This growth is predicated on market share gains and cost synergies rather than explosive market expansion, but it does represent a sizable increase in sales from the current base.
**Answer:** Yes

#### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's primary focus for development is the integration of HanesBrands, which it describes as a way to "Create a Global Basic Apparel Leader." The company has identified $200 million in annual run-rate cost synergies to be achieved within three years, suggesting a focus on process optimization. Standalone, Gildan's management noted in its Q2 2025 earnings call that new programs and product innovation were key drivers of activewear sales growth. The commitment is present, though heavily centered on acquisition integration for the medium term.
**Answer:** Yes

#### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan does not disclose specific R&D expenditures as a separate line item in its financial statements, which is common for apparel manufacturers focused on process rather than technological invention. Innovation is discussed in terms of product features (e.g., lightweight performance fabric) and manufacturing efficiency. Without disclosed metrics on R&D spending or patent output, and with M&A being the primary driver of strategic development, there is insufficient evidence to assess its effectiveness relative to its size.
**Answer:** No

#### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan has a well-established global distribution network, selling basic apparel to a wide range of customers including retailers like Walmart and printwear shops. The company’s vertically integrated model is a key competitive advantage, allowing it to manage costs and supply chains effectively. The pending acquisition of HanesBrands will further strengthen its sales channels and brand portfolio. However, recent results showed weakness in international and hosiery/underwear segments, indicating some challenges. While the organization is large and efficient, there is not enough specific evidence (e.g., NRR, win rates) to definitively classify it as "above-average."
**Answer:** No

#### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For its second quarter of 2025, Gildan reported a gross margin improvement of 110 basis points to 31.5%. This was driven by lower raw material and manufacturing costs, demonstrating the company's ability to translate operational efficiency into profitability. The company's vertically integrated "seed-to-shirt" manufacturing process is a key driver of its cost structure and competitive margins within the basic apparel industry. This level of profitability is healthy for its sector.
**Answer:** Yes

#### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary stated action for future margin improvement is the HanesBrands acquisition, which is expected to generate at least $200 million in annual run-rate cost synergies within three years. These synergies are targeted across the supply chain, operations, and SG&A. In its current operations, Gildan has already demonstrated margin improvement through favorable pricing and lower manufacturing costs. This dual approach of operational efficiency and acquisition synergy provides a clear path to maintaining or improving margins.
**Answer:** Yes

#### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent proxy fight provides strong, positive evidence on this point. During the battle to reinstate former CEO Glenn Chamandy, a group of executives wrote a letter to shareholders stating it was "critical" to bring him back for the company's success. This indicates strong loyalty and positive relations within the senior ranks. While this doesn't provide insight into relations with the broader manufacturing workforce, such a public display of support from management is a powerful and unusual indicator.
**Answer:** Yes

#### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company just endured a severe and public proxy fight that resulted in the ousting of the board and the then-CEO, Vince Tyra, in May 2024. The battle was triggered by the previous board's decision to fire long-time CEO Glenn Chamandy in late 2023 over strategic disagreements. This event, which cost the company an estimated US$77 million, demonstrates a complete breakdown in relations between the CEO and the former board. Although a new board has been installed and the CEO reinstated, the recent turmoil is a clear sign of poor, not outstanding, executive relations.
**Answer:** No

#### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent proxy fight provides conflicting evidence. On one hand, the fact that a group of executives at the VP-level and higher organized to support the ousted CEO suggests a capable and engaged leadership tier below the C-suite. On the other hand, the turmoil resulted in the departure of the Chief Human Resources and Legal Affairs officer, and the interim CEO. The return of Glenn Chamandy, who has run the company for decades, highlights a degree of key-person reliance. The situation is still fluid following the May 2024 leadership change.
**Answer:** No

#### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan's investor materials demonstrate a focus on cost control, which is central to its vertically integrated business model. The company provides clear segment reporting and discusses cost drivers (e.g., raw materials, manufacturing) in its financial reports. There have been no recent announcements of material weaknesses in internal controls or accounting restatements. However, the one-time costs related to the proxy fight (US$77 million) were substantial and impacted net earnings significantly, demonstrating that governance failures can lead to unexpected and material costs.
**Answer:** Yes

#### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan's primary competitive advantage is its large-scale, vertically integrated manufacturing model. Owning the entire production process from yarn spinning to finished garments allows for significant cost control and supply chain management, which is a key differentiator in the high-volume, low-price basic apparel industry. This "seed-to-shirt" strategy is fundamental to its ability to achieve strong profit margins and compete effectively against other global players.
**Answer:** Yes

#### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The acquisition of HanesBrands is a definitive move focused on long-range profits at the potential expense of near-term results. The company is taking on significant debt, with pro-forma leverage expected to be ~2.6x adjusted EBITDA at closing, and will incur substantial integration costs. Management has provided a 2026-2028 outlook, demonstrating a focus on the multi-year horizon required to realize the full value of the combination. This strategic M&A, prioritizing scale and synergies over immediate margin expansion or buybacks, is strong evidence of a long-range outlook.

#### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The HanesBrands transaction is structured as approximately 87% stock and 13% cash, which will be significantly dilutive to existing Gildan shareholders. While the company also secured $2.3 billion in debt financing for the deal and to refinance HanesBrands' debt, the heavy reliance on stock issuance for this transformative acquisition is the most direct evidence possible of meaningful dilution. Furthermore, on August 2, 2024, the company announced a new normal course issuer bid (buyback), but this is overshadowed by the subsequent, much larger stock issuance for the merger.
**Answer:** No

#### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The proxy fight that consumed the company from late 2023 to mid-2024 was characterized by public accusations from both sides, indicating a breakdown of controlled and candid communication. The former board was accused by the reinstated CEO of being "very abusive to shareholders' money." While the new board and reinstated CEO are now in place, the recent history is one of public warfare rather than transparent dialogue with all stakeholders. It will take time to rebuild a track record of candor.
**Answer:** No

#### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The proxy fight severely damaged the perception of integrity. The conflict cost shareholders US$77 million, including a US$15.3 million payout to an interim CEO of just four months and a US$9.1 million payout to another departed executive. The reinstated CEO called these payouts "shocking" and not "very clean." While the current management team won the proxy fight with strong shareholder support, the governance failure and enormous costs involved raise serious questions about the integrity of the company's governance processes and former leadership.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis (5–7 sentences):**
Gildan Activewear scores moderately on Fisher's checklist, with strong positives in its core business operations, such as its competitive advantages from vertical integration and worthwhile profit margins. The company also demonstrates a clear long-range outlook through its transformative, albeit dilutive, acquisition of HanesBrands. However, the score is significantly dragged down by severe governance failures stemming from the 2024 proxy fight, which led to "No" answers for executive relations, candor, and integrity. The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the execution of the HanesBrands merger and the performance of the new board. A smooth integration that delivers on its promised $200 million synergy target would validate the long-term strategy. Evidence of stable governance, a rebuilt management team, and a period without public infighting would be required to flip the negative governance-related points to "Yes."

**fisher score is 7 / 15**
