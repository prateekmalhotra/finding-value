### **D) Free Cash Flow Build**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure. The formula used is:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (USD millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| Beta | 1.05 | (Investing.com, Aug 20, 2025) |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value** = ($125,866 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.094 - 0.025) = **$1,868,741 million**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $203,836 + $45,297 = $249,133 million
    *   Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple = $1,868,741 / $249,133 = **7.5x**. This is well below the historical median of ~20x-25x, suggesting the Gordon Growth terminal value is conservative. The lower of the two values is selected.

| Component | Value (USD millions) |
| :--- | :--- |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $1,118,964 / 7,465 = **$150.00**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$150.00**
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($110.00):** Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 10% declining to 4%), margin compression to 42%, and a higher WACC of 10.5%.
    *   **High/Bull Case ($200.00):** Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 16% declining to 8%), margin expansion to 47%, and a lower WACC of 8.5%.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value:
    *   $150.00 * (1 - 0.30) = **$105.00**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **AI Monetization Risk:** The significant capex for AI infrastructure may not translate into the expected high-margin revenue, pressuring free cash flow generation.
2.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a dominant player in cloud computing and AI, Microsoft faces increasing antitrust and regulatory risks globally, which could result in fines or business restrictions.
3.  **Competition:** The cloud computing and AI markets are intensely competitive, with major players like Amazon and Google. Failure to innovate and maintain a competitive edge could lead to market share loss and margin erosion.
4.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** A global economic slowdown could impact IT budgets, slowing down the adoption of cloud services and software, which are key revenue drivers for Microsoft.
5.  **Execution Risk:** The ambitious AI-driven growth strategy requires flawless execution. Any missteps in product development, integration, or go-to-market strategy could hinder growth prospects.
