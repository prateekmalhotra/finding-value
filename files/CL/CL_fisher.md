### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate-Palmolive operates in the stable and growing Oral Care, Personal Care, Home Care, and Pet Nutrition markets. The company derives approximately 45% of its net sales from emerging markets, which provide a long runway for growth as consumer incomes rise. In 2024, the company demonstrated its growth potential with a 7.4% increase in organic sales, driven by a 3.1% rise in volume. The global oral care market alone is projected to grow at a 6.4% CAGR from 2025 to 2030, indicating solid underlying category health.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's stated business strategy is centered on "science-led, core and premium innovation" and expanding into "higher-growth adjacent categories." A key process innovation is its first-of-its-kind recyclable toothpaste tube, with 75% of its global toothpaste portfolio transitioned by year-end 2024. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Noel Wallace highlighted the launch of new whitening products and expansion of the Hill's Pet Nutrition therapeutic lines as key drivers for future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Colgate allocated 1.8% of its revenue to R&D in 2024. While this is lower than its larger competitor Procter & Gamble (2.5%-2.7%), Colgate maintains global market share leadership in its core toothpaste (41.4%) and manual toothbrush (32.2%) categories. The successful development and rollout of complex projects like the recyclable tube technology and the February 2025 launch of a new three-product oral care system demonstrate high R&D effectiveness, yielding significant product differentiation from a relatively modest budget.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's products are marketed in over 200 countries and territories through a direct sales force and distributors. Colgate's sales organization maintains global market leadership in toothpaste with a 41.4% share and manual toothbrushes with a 32.2% share as of year-end 2024, with share gains in multiple regions. This sustained global leadership in highly competitive categories is direct evidence of a superior sales and distribution network.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Colgate's GAAP Gross Profit Margin was 60.5% and its Operating Profit Margin was 21.2%. These margins are strong on an absolute basis and represent an improvement over 2023 levels of 58.2% and 20.5%, respectively. Compared to its largest competitor, Procter & Gamble, whose 2024 gross margin was 51.3%, Colgate's gross margin is substantially higher, indicating strong pricing power and cost controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025), [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PG/procter-gamble/gross-margin](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PG/procter-gamble/gross-margin) (undated)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a formal "funding-the-growth" initiative focused on cost reduction across materials, logistics, and advertising. In 2024, these initiatives, combined with pricing actions, drove a 2.4 percentage point increase in non-GAAP gross margin. The company also completed its "2022 Global Productivity Initiative" on December 31, 2024, which delivered approximately $125 million in annualized pretax savings by streamlining the supply chain and increasing operational efficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K describes corporate values of being "Caring, Inclusive and Courageous" and notes a commitment to listening to employees via engagement surveys. However, there is no verifiable data on attrition or engagement scores. A search for recent labor issues found no major strikes but did highlight a long-running class-action lawsuit with pensioners over miscalculated benefits, which the company settled in June 2025 after losing an appeal. The adverse outcome of this pension dispute suggests relations, at least with former employees, have not been outstanding.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team exhibits significant stability and long tenure. Per the 2024 10-K, Chairman & CEO Noel Wallace was first elected an executive officer in 2009. Other key leaders, such as the Chief Legal Officer (2014), Group President, Growth and Strategy (2019), and Group President, Europe (2019), also have long tenures with the company. This stability at the highest levels points to strong and effective working relationships among the senior leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a formal, "rigorous succession planning process" that is overseen by the Global Human Resources function and the Board of Directors, with a special focus on CEO succession. This process includes reviewing potential successors for key positions and planning developmental assignments. The public disclosure of seven distinct executive officer roles, including Group Presidents for different functions, indicates a bench of senior leaders with significant operational responsibility beyond the CEO.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The MD&A section of the 10-K provides granular detail on the drivers of gross margin changes, breaking out the basis-point impact of pricing, cost savings, and raw material costs, which demonstrates a strong handle on cost analysis. The company has no history of recent financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the consumer packaged goods industry, brand equity and distribution channels are paramount. A key clue to Colgate's strength is its relationship with professionals; its Oral Care products are marketed to dentists, and its Hill's Pet Nutrition products are sold through veterinarians and authorized pet retailers. This professional endorsement model creates a significant competitive moat. Furthermore, Colgate's flagship brand is known as the "world's most penetrated brand," showcasing an unmatched global distribution and consumer awareness network.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a focus on long-term growth by consistently reinvesting in its brands. In 2024, advertising investment increased by 14.7% in absolute terms and rose to 13.5% of sales from 12.2% in 2023. This increased investment in brand-building occurred simultaneously with programs to expand margins, indicating a balanced approach that prioritizes long-range brand health over maximizing short-term profitability. The multi-year effort to develop and roll out its recyclable tube technology is another example of long-term investment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is very strong, obviating any need for equity financing. In 2024, Colgate generated $4.1 billion in net cash from operations. This cash flow comfortably funded capital expenditures, dividends, and a share repurchase program. The company returned capital to shareholders, buying back approximately $1.7 billion of its own stock in 2024, thereby reducing its share count rather than diluting it.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion in the 2024 10-K demonstrates candor. When discussing segment performance, the company directly states that Personal Care sales in North America decreased "primarily due to organic sales declines in the skin health and underarm protection categories." Similarly, for Pet Nutrition, it acknowledges that organic sales growth was achieved "despite a negative impact from lower private label pet nutrition sales of 210 bps." This willingness to openly identify underperforming categories and specific negative impacts reflects transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A search for SEC investigations or scandals revealed no recent issues related to fraud or corruption. However, the standard is "unquestionable integrity." In 2023, the company recorded a $267 million charge after losing a final appeal in a lawsuit concerning a 2005 pension plan amendment, with courts finding the company had underpaid retirees. While not a case of personal enrichment or fraud, losing a lawsuit over employee benefit calculations, which was then settled in June 2025, represents a significant failure to meet obligations to its people and places a question mark on its corporate integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21665/000002166525000008/cl-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025), [https://www.law360.com/articles/some-link-to-colgate-pension-case](https://www.law360.com/articles/some-link-to-colgate-pension-case) (June 6, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
Colgate-Palmolive scores well on most of Fisher's points, revealing a high-quality, shareholder-friendly business with dominant market positions, excellent financial controls, and strong margins. Its primary strengths are its world-leading brands, its disciplined approach to margin enhancement through productivity programs, and its stable, long-tenured management team. The two "No" answers—on labor relations and integrity—both stem from the same core issue: an adverse court ruling on miscalculated pension benefits. While not a fraud, this is a material failure in its obligations to former employees that blemishes an otherwise clean record. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the performance of its innovation pipeline and its ability to continue driving volume growth in emerging markets. Evidence that the company has improved its internal processes for managing employee benefits and compensation plans post-lawsuit would be required to flip the "No" answers to "Yes".

**Fisher Score is 13 / 15**
