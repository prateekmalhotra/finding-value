### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway

**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's core broadband service continues to have a long runway, driven by increasing data consumption and the necessity of high-speed internet. The company is actively expanding its footprint through a subsidized rural construction initiative, which is expected to add over 1.7 million new passings. Additionally, Charter's mobile service, Spectrum Mobile, is a key growth driver, adding over 2.1 million mobile lines in 2024. The convergence of broadband and mobile services, exemplified by their Spectrum One package, provides a strong value proposition to consumers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development

**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter is making significant investments in its network and product offerings. The company is in the process of a network evolution initiative to deliver multi-gigabit and symmetrical speeds across its footprint. They are also expanding their service offerings to include seamless entertainment applications such as Disney+, Max, and Peacock within their TV packages. Furthermore, the development and deployment of the Xumo stream box as the preferred platform for new video sales demonstrates a commitment to evolving with changing media consumption habits.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a cable operator, Charter's R&D is more focused on network evolution and product integration rather than fundamental research. The company's network evolution plan, which includes upgrades to DOCSIS 4.0 and spectrum expansion, is a key indicator of its R&D efforts. The successful launch and scaling of Spectrum Mobile, which leverages both their own network and a partnership with Verizon, demonstrates effective development and integration of new services. The company also holds 210 CBRS Priority Access Licenses, which it intends to use to build out its own 5G mobile network.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's sales and marketing efforts are focused on a centralized, data-driven approach. The company utilizes a variety of sales channels, including inbound, direct sales, online, and retail stores, to reach customers. The launch of the "Life Unlimited" brand platform and a simplified pricing structure in September 2024 is a key initiative to drive customer growth. However, the company has faced challenges with customer growth, losing 508,000 internet customers in 2024, partly due to the end of the FCC's Affordable Connectivity Program. While mobile line growth has been strong, the core internet subscriber trend raises questions about the overall effectiveness of the sales organization in a competitive market.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Charter reported income from operations of $13.1 billion on revenues of $55.1 billion, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 23.8%. The company's Adjusted EBITDA for the same period was $22.6 billion, for an Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 41.0%. These margins are substantial and indicative of a profitable business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter is focused on several initiatives to maintain and improve profit margins. The company is driving higher-margin mobile revenue growth, which leverages their existing network infrastructure. They are also focused on improving operational efficiency by insourcing most of their customer operations and using technology to enhance customer service and reduce costs. Additionally, the company is actively managing its programming costs, which are a significant expense, through negotiations with content providers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter emphasizes its commitment to its workforce, citing competitive wages (with a minimum of $20 per hour for hourly employees), comprehensive benefits, and opportunities for training and advancement. The company also highlights its Broadband Technician Apprenticeship Program, which is certified by the U.S. Department of Labor. However, there is no readily available, independent, and recent evidence to definitively assess the state of labor relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 8) Executive Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's executive team appears to be stable. Christopher Winfrey has been with the company since 2010 and was appointed President and CEO in December 2022. Other key executives have also been with the company for several years. The company has a 13-member board of directors, with representation from major shareholders Liberty Broadband and Advance/Newhouse. While there's no evidence of discord, the high level of influence from major shareholders may not be ideal for all investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 9) Depth of Management

**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's leadership team includes experienced executives in key roles beyond the CEO, such as a Chief Financial Officer, President of Product and Technology, and a President of Sales. The company's centralized management structure, with corporate-level direction for major functions, suggests a coordinated approach to operations. The company's proxy statement provides detailed information on the background and experience of its executive officers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter provides detailed segment reporting in its financial statements, breaking down revenue and customer statistics by residential, SMB, and enterprise categories. The company's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This suggests that the company has adequate cost analysis and accounting controls in place.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for Charter is its extensive hybrid fiber-coaxial network, which passes an estimated 57 million homes and businesses. This infrastructure allows for the efficient delivery of high-speed broadband and other services. The company's ability to bundle broadband with a fast-growing mobile service (Spectrum Mobile) is a significant differentiator. The company's scale also provides advantages in programming negotiations and advertising sales.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's significant investments in its network evolution and rural expansion initiatives demonstrate a long-range outlook. The company expects to invest over $8 billion in its rural construction initiative, which it believes will generate "long-term infrastructure-style returns." These investments, while requiring substantial upfront capital, are aimed at securing future growth and competitiveness. The company's consistent share repurchase program also suggests a focus on long-term shareholder value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter has a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks, not issuing new shares. In 2024, the company repurchased $1.2 billion of its common stock. The company's free cash flow of $4.3 billion in 2024, along with its access to debt markets, provides sufficient capital to fund its growth initiatives without the need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A recent class-action lawsuit filed against Charter alleges that the company and its senior executives made misleading statements about the impact of the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP). The lawsuit claims that the company downplayed the negative effects of the program's termination, leading to a stock price drop when the full impact was revealed. This lawsuit, filed in August 2025, raises serious questions about management's candor with investors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The aforementioned securities class-action lawsuit, filed on August 21, 2025, brings the integrity of management into question. The lawsuit alleges that senior executives violated federal securities laws by making misleading statements to investors. While these are just allegations at this point, the existence of such a lawsuit prevents an assessment of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

---
**Synthesis:** Charter Communications scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its strong market position, profitable business model, and long-term investment strategy. The company's extensive network, growing mobile business, and commitment to network upgrades are significant positives. However, the recent securities class-action lawsuit casts a shadow over the company's governance and management integrity. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the outcome of this lawsuit and the company's ability to return to sustained internet subscriber growth. A dismissal of the lawsuit and a clear trend of positive internet additions would likely flip the "No" answers on points 14 and 15 to "Yes," and potentially point 4 as well.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
