I've got the search results for the latest SEC filings. It looks like the most recent 10-K is from October 2024, and there are several subsequent 10-Q filings. I'll use the provided URLs from the prompt to get the specific data. I will start by browsing the 10-Q filings to construct the TTM financials.I have browsed the 10-Q filings for the quarters ending May 11, 2025, February 16, 2025, and November 24, 2024. Now I need to find the fourth quarter of the TTM period, which will be in the 10-K filing for the fiscal year ending September 1, 2024. I will browse the provided URL for the 10-K. I will then have all the data needed to calculate the TTM financials. After that, I will move on to finding management guidance and the WACC components.I have successfully gathered all the necessary financial data from the 10-Q and 10-K filings. I also have the latest earnings call transcripts. Now I can proceed with the valuation. I will start by calculating the TTM financials and then move on to the other steps outlined in the user's request.

Here's the data I've gathered to calculate the TTM financials ending May 11, 2025:

### B) Management Guidance Extraction

*   **Capex:** "In the first thirty-six weeks of 2025, we spent $3,532 on capital expenditures, and it is our current intention to spend slightly over $5,000 during fiscal 2025." (10-Q, May 11, 2025)
*   **New Warehouse Openings:** "We opened 17 new warehouses, including two relocations, in the first thirty-six weeks of 2025 and plan to open ten additional new warehouses, including one relocation, in the remainder of fiscal 2025." (10-Q, May 11, 2025)
*   No explicit guidance on revenue growth or margins was provided.

### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1:** 8.0%. Based on the TTM comparable sales growth of 6% plus the contribution from new stores. (Q3 2025 Earnings Call, May 29, 2025)
    *   **Years 2-5:** 6.0% annually, tapering down to a long-term growth rate. This is in line with historical comparable sales growth.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** 3.67%, held constant. This is the TTM operating margin and is in line with the 3-year average. No specific management guidance on margin expansion.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 24.9%. This is the effective tax rate for the first 36 weeks of fiscal 2025. (10-Q, May 11, 2025)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** $5,000 million in Year 1, then growing at 3% per year. The initial figure is based on management guidance.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Assumed to be -0.5% of the change in revenue, reflecting Costco's efficient working capital management.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** Projected as 0.36% of revenue, consistent with the TTM percentage.
    *   **Diluted Share Count:** 444.8 million shares, held constant. (10-Q, May 11, 2025)

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

*   **FCFF Formula:** EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $271,646 | $9,965 | $4,589 |
| 2 | $287,945 | $10,562 | $5,016 |
| 3 | $305,221 | $11,196 | $5,436 |
| 4 | $323,535 | $11,868 | $5,845 |
| 5 | $342,947 | $12,580 | $6,238 |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-Year US Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 0.95 (5-Year Monthly Beta from Finbox). A beta below 1 reflects Costco's defensive characteristics and stable demand.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 0.95 \* 5.0% = 9.04%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Interest Expense / Average Debt:** 2.44%
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 2.44% \* (1 - 24.9%) = 1.83%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity:** $435,225M (Based on recent stock price)
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $5,895M
    *   **WACC = (E / (E+D)) \* CoE + (D / (E+D)) \* CoD \* (1-t) = (435,225 / 441,120) \* 9.04% + (5,895 / 441,120) \* 1.83% = 8.94%**

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a reasonable long-term inflation expectation.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1+g)) / (WACC - g) = ($6,238 \* 1.025) / (8.94% - 2.5%) = $99,235M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $15,800M (EBIT + D&A)
    *   **10-Year Historical Median EV/EBITDA:** ~20x
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 15,800 \* 20 = $316,000M**
*   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value and will be used.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** $20,854M
    *   **PV of Terminal Value:** $64,571M
    *   **Enterprise Value = $20,854M + $64,571M = $85,425M**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt = $85,425M - ($5,895M - $13,836M) = $93,366M**

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $93,366M / 444.8M = $209.91**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$209.91**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Lower revenue growth (e.g., 4%) and margin compression could lead to a value of **~$180**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Higher revenue growth (e.g., 8%) and modest margin expansion could lead to a value of **~$240**.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):**
    *   **MOS Price = $209.91 \* (1 - 0.30) = $146.94**

### I) Risk Notes

*   **Competition:** The retail landscape is intensely competitive. Increased price competition from Walmart, Amazon, and other retailers could pressure margins.
*   **Economic Sensitivity:** While a defensive retailer, a significant economic downturn could impact membership growth and discretionary spending.
*   **International Performance:** A significant portion of growth is expected from international markets, which carry currency and political risks.
*   **Margin Pressure:** Rising labor costs and supply chain disruptions could impact Costco's ability to maintain its low-cost advantage and margins.
*   **High Valuation:** The current market price implies very high expectations for future growth, making the stock vulnerable to any operational missteps.

final answer is 209.91 $
