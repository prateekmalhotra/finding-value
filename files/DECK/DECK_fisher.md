**Synthesis:**
Deckers Outdoor Corporation scores very highly on the Philip A. Fisher analysis, with strong positives in its brand strength, growth runway, financial health, and management quality. The key variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months are the continued growth trajectory of the HOKA brand, the ability to maintain premium pricing and strong margins in a competitive environment, and the successful expansion into new product categories and international markets. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with more quantitative data on employee satisfaction and turnover, which is not currently disclosed.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
