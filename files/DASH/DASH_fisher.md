**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash is expanding its services beyond restaurant food delivery into new categories like grocery, retail, and alcohol, significantly increasing its Total Addressable Market (TAM). The company's 2024 10-K filing outlines this strategy, highlighting the large and underpenetrated nature of these new markets. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, management reiterated their focus on these growth areas, citing strong consumer adoption and increasing order frequency.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash consistently invests in new product development and platform enhancements. The company's recent acquisition of Wolt in 2022 expanded its international presence and technological capabilities. DoorDash's R&D expenses were $257 million in Q2 2025, demonstrating a continued commitment to innovation. The Q2 2025 earnings call also detailed ongoing investments in new verticals and features to enhance the customer and Dasher experience.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash's R&D spending is substantial and has led to the successful launch of new features and services, including DashPass, and the expansion into grocery and retail. However, the company's R&D as a percentage of revenue is in line with its main competitor, Uber. The direct ROI on these investments is not always clear, with the company still reporting a net loss.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000179278925000012/dash-20250630.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash has a strong sales and marketing function that has successfully onboarded a large number of merchants and customers. Sales and marketing expenses were a significant portion of revenue in the most recent quarter. The company's ability to maintain a leading market share in the U.S. food delivery market suggests an effective sales and marketing strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000179278925000012/dash-20250630.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash has yet to achieve consistent profitability. While gross margins are positive, the company's operating margin remains negative due to high sales and marketing and R&D expenses. For the quarter ending June 30, 2025, the company reported a net loss. The company is still in a high-growth phase, prioritizing market share gains over short-term profitability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000179278925000012/dash-20250630.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash is focused on improving its operational efficiency and logistics to drive margin improvement. The company is also working to increase its advertising revenue and grow its higher-margin DashPass subscription business. Management discussed these initiatives in their Q2 2025 earnings call, expressing confidence in their ability to drive long-term margin expansion.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?

**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash's key competitive advantages are its strong network effects and its sophisticated logistics platform. The company's large and growing network of customers, merchants, and Dashers creates a powerful moat that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's logistics technology allows it to efficiently manage a high volume of orders and deliveries.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash's management team has consistently stated that they are focused on long-term growth and are willing to make investments that may not pay off in the short term. This is reflected in the company's high level of spending on sales and marketing and R&D.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, DoorDash had a strong balance sheet with a significant cash and cash equivalents balance. The company has also demonstrated an ability to generate positive cash flow from operations. This strong financial position should allow the company to fund its growth initiatives without needing to raise additional equity capital in the near term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000179278925000012/dash-20250630.htm']

Synthesis:
DoorDash exhibits many of the qualities that Philip Fisher sought in a growth investment. The company has a long runway for growth, a strong commitment to innovation, and a talented and experienced management team. However, the company has yet to achieve consistent profitability and faces ongoing challenges with its labor relations. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to achieve sustained profitability, and the resolution of the legal and regulatory issues surrounding the classification of its Dashers. A "No" on profit margins would flip to a "Yes" with a few consecutive quarters of positive and expanding operating margins. Similarly, a "No" on labor relations could be changed with the successful implementation of a new model for Dasher classification and compensation that is acceptable to all stakeholders.

fisher score is 12 / 15
