### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a commitment to developing new concepts and brands. The Nuuly rental platform, launched in 2019, represents a significant process innovation and a new business model that now generates substantial revenue.

The company's capital allocation priorities include investing in new stores and technology to support these growing segments.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a retailer, R&D is reflected in brand development, merchandising, and technology. URBN does not report traditional R&D expenses. However, its effectiveness can be measured by its success in launching and scaling new concepts like the Nuuly rental service, which has grown rapidly and is adding thousands of subscribers quarterly. The company also invests in data analytics and technology to improve merchandising and customer experience, which is mentioned as a key to their strategy. The sustained growth of distinct brands like Free People and Anthropologie suggests an effective model for developing and marketing new fashion concepts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/URBN/transcripts/' (May 21, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** URBN has a multi-channel sales strategy that includes a global footprint of 702 stores and a robust direct-to-consumer (DTC) digital channel. The digital channel is well-developed and accounts for a significant portion of sales. For the three months ended April 30, 2025, the company reported a 10% increase in total Retail segment comparable sales, indicating strong sales performance. The rapid growth of the Nuuly subscription business further demonstrates an ability to execute innovative sales models.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025083755/urbn-20250430.htm' (May 28, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, URBN's gross profit margin was 33.5%. In the most recent quarter ended April 30, 2025, the gross margin improved by 111 basis points to 34.4%, driven by higher initial markups and lower markdowns. Operating income for the quarter was $79 million, with a net income of $52.7 million. These margins are healthy for the specialty retail industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025083755/urbn-20250430.htm' (May 28, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement. In the Q1 2026 earnings call, they credited the 111 basis point improvement in gross margin to higher initial merchandise markups and lower markdowns at all three major brands. They are also leveraging their proprietary distribution and fulfillment network to manage costs and improve efficiency, which has been particularly important for the rapidly scaling Nuuly segment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/URBN/transcripts/' (May 21, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K filing from March 2025 states that "labor-related matters have not had a significant impact on our operations," and that none of their employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. While public filings provide limited insight into day-to-day employee relations, the absence of disclosed major labor disputes, strikes, or unionization drives is a positive indicator. The company employs approximately 29,000 people.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is stability in key leadership roles. Richard Hayne, a co-founder, has been Chairman of the Board since 1976 and CEO from 2020. Sheila Harrington has been the CEO of the Free People Brand since 2021 and has been with the company since 2002. This long tenure among top executives suggests a stable and cohesive team. There are no recent reports of significant executive turnover or internal disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** URBN is structured with distinct CEOs for each of its major brands (Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and Free People), indicating a layer of experienced leadership below the corporate CEO level. For example, Tricia Smith, the Global CEO of the Anthropologie Group, has been in her role since 2021. This brand-level leadership structure provides operational depth and clear lines of responsibility for the company's diverse concepts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. The company provides detailed segment-level financial data, breaking down revenues and other key metrics for its different brands, which suggests a good handle on cost analysis. There is no recent history of significant restatements or disclosed material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025083755/urbn-20250430.htm' (May 28, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator for URBN is its portfolio of distinct, well-defined lifestyle brands that appeal to different customer segments, reducing reliance on a single brand or demographic. This brand diversification is a competitive advantage in the hit-driven apparel industry. The successful incubation and scaling of new concepts, most notably the Nuuly rental business, demonstrates an ability to innovate beyond traditional retail models and adapt to changing consumer behavior.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/URBN/transcripts/' (May 21, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sustained investment in the Nuuly brand, which is a newer, high-growth but likely lower-margin business in its early stages, demonstrates a long-range perspective. Management's discussion of capital allocation prioritizes investments in new stores for its growth brands and technology enhancements, which are long-term initiatives. They continue to fund these growth areas while also delivering solid current profitability, striking a balance between near-term and long-term outlooks.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/URBN/transcripts/' (May 21, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong balance sheet with $371 million in cash and marketable securities and no debt as of April 30, 2025. The company generates healthy cash flow from operations ($474 million in the fiscal year ended Jan 31, 2025). Furthermore, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of 20 million shares in June 2023, signaling confidence in the company's financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025083755/urbn-20250430.htm' (May 28, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the Q1 2026 earnings call from May 21, 2025, shows that management openly discusses both positive and negative aspects of the business. For example, they directly address the performance of each brand, noting the strength at Anthropologie and Free People while also explaining the lower-than-expected sales at the Urban Outfitters brand and the steps being taken to improve its performance. This balanced commentary in public forums suggests a good degree of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/URBN/transcripts/' (May 21, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's latest 10-K filing discloses routine legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, but it states that it does not believe the outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial position. There are no recent major scandals, regulatory actions, or governance red flags apparent in the primary filings. The company has a code of conduct for employees and directors. The long tenure of the co-founder and other key executives also points to a stable governance environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912615/000095017025048506/urbn-20250131.htm' (March 27, 2025)]

---
**Synthesis:** Urban Outfitters scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, presenting as a well-managed company with a strong portfolio of distinct brands and promising growth avenues. Its key strengths lie in its proven ability to develop and scale new concepts like FP Movement and the innovative Nuuly rental service, a strong balance sheet with no debt, and stable, experienced management. The biggest variable that could change this score in the next 12-24 months is execution risk within the core Urban Outfitters brand, which has lagged behind the other concepts. A sustained failure to reinvigorate this brand could lead to a "No" on points related to sales organization and long-runway products. Additionally, a downturn in consumer discretionary spending could pressure the company's "worthwhile profit margins." To maintain its high score, URBN must demonstrate a successful turnaround at the Urban Outfitters brand and continue the strong growth trajectory of Nuuly and its international expansion.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
