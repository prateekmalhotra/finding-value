Of course. This is a well-structured valuation, but you've correctly identified some areas where the assumptions could be refined to better reflect the reality of Yum! Brands' business model. The primary issues are related to capital intensity and the terminal value calculation, which appear overly conservative for a capital-light franchisor.

Here is a revised valuation with adjustments to address these points, presented in the same format.

### **PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)**

This section determines the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1)  **Current Market Price**: $134.50 (August 22, 2025).

2)  **Baseline Financials (LTM)**: The following table represents the Last Twelve Months (LTM) financials for the period ended June 30, 2025.

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $7,350 |
| Gross Margin | 53.5% |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $2,580 |
| Net Income | $1,750 |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $330 |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $150 |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | ($380) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($55) |
| Interest Expense | $540 |
| Cash & Equivalents | $550 |
| Total Debt | $11,350 |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 285 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current enterprise value of approximately $48,933 million (Market Cap of $38,333 million + Net Debt of $10,800 million), the market must underwrite a specific set of future performance expectations.

*   **Market-Implied Assumptions**: Holding operating margins steady at the LTM level of 35.1% ($2,580M / $7,350M) and using a plausible Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 7.76%, the model requires a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.5%** to arrive at the current market price of $134.50.

This growth rate is what an investor implicitly accepts when buying the stock today, assuming margins and returns on capital remain consistent with recent history.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALITY-ADJUSTED BASE-CASE)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on assumptions adjusted to better reflect YUM's capital-light franchise model.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6)  **Rationale**: The original valuation's assumptions for capital intensity (Capex and D&A as a percent of revenue) were too high for a company that is over 98% franchised. Franchisees bear the primary cost of store construction and maintenance. This revised model corrects those assumptions to reflect YUM's actual capital-light business model, which results in higher free cash flow conversion. Revenue growth is kept moderate and margins are held stable, consistent with a mature industry leader.

7)  **Revenue for Years 1–5**: I will use a **5.0% growth rate for Years 1-2, tapering to 4.0% in Years 3-5.** This is a reasonable assumption for a mature company, balancing new unit development with same-store sales growth.

8)  **Margin Path**: Operating margin (EBIT) is projected to remain stable at **35.0%** of revenue, consistent with the LTM figure and historical averages for a highly-franchised business.

9)  **Taxes**: The effective tax rate is assumed to be **21.0%**, in line with the U.S. statutory rate and company history.

10) **Capital Intensity**:
    *   **Capex**: Modeled at **2.5% of revenue**. This is a significant adjustment from the original 5.2% and is far more representative of a capital-light franchisor's true maintenance and growth capital needs.
    *   **D&A**: Modeled at **3.5% of revenue**. This is reduced from 4.5% to better align with a lower asset base, while still reflecting the amortization of technology investments and depreciation of corporate assets.
    *   **Working Capital**: Change in NWC is modeled at **0.75% of incremental revenue**, based on historical trends.

11) **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks**:
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is treated as a real cash expense and is projected at **2.0% of revenue**.
    *   The diluted share count is projected to decrease by **1.2% annually**, reflecting consistent share repurchase programs.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12) **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** is calculated as:
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`
The lower capital intensity assumptions result in significantly higher free cash flow generation.

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $7,718 | $8,103 | $8,428 | $8,765 | $9,115 |
| EBIT (35.0%) | $2,701 | $2,836 | $2,950 | $3,068 | $3,190 |
| NOPAT | $2,134 | $2,241 | $2,330 | $2,423 | $2,520 |
| D&A (3.5% of Rev) | $270 | $284 | $295 | $307 | $319 |
| Capex (2.5% of Rev) | ($193) | ($203) | ($211) | ($219) | ($228) |
| SBC (2.0% of Rev) | ($154) | ($162) | ($169) | ($175) | ($182) |
| Δ in NWC | ($3) | ($3) | ($2) | ($3) | ($3) |
| **FCFF** | **$2,054** | **$2,157** | **$2,243** | **$2,333** | **$2,426** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14) **Cost of Equity (CAPM)**:
*   **Risk-Free Rate**: **4.20%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)**: **5.00%**.
*   **Beta (β)**: **0.95**.
*   *Cost of Equity = 4.20% + 0.95 * 5.00% = **8.95%***

15) **Cost of Debt**:
*   *Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt = $540M / $11,350M = **4.76%***.
*   *After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.76% * (1 - 21.0%) = **3.76%***

16) **WACC**:
*   Market Value of Equity (E): $38,333M
*   Market Value of Debt (D): $11,350M
*   *WACC = (E / (E+D)) * CoE + (D / (E+D)) * After-Tax CoD*
*   *WACC = (38,333 / 49,683) * 8.95% + (11,350 / 49,683) * 3.76% = **7.76%***

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17) **Exit Multiple Method**: For a mature, high-quality, and stable business like YUM, an EV/EBITDA exit multiple is often a more realistic approach than a perpetual growth formula. The original model's implied multiple of 12.3x was too conservative. A multiple of **16.0x** is more appropriate, reflecting the company's capital-light model, strong brand portfolio, and consistent cash flows, placing it in line with high-quality QSR peers.

18) **Terminal Value Calculation**:
*   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $3,190M + $319M = **$3,509M**.
*   *Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple*
*   *Terminal Value = $3,509M * 16.0 = **$56,144 million***.

19) **Implied Growth Rate Cross-Check**: This terminal value implies a perpetual growth rate (`g`) of **3.31%**, which is a reasonable long-term expectation for a global company (slightly above long-term inflation).
*   *Implied g = (WACC*TV - FCFF_5) / (TV + FCFF_5) = (7.76% * 56,144 - 2,426) / (56,144 + 2,426) = 3.31%*

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

20) **Enterprise Value**:
*   PV of Explicit FCFF = $1,906 + $1,851 + $1,791 + $1,728 + $1,666 = **$8,942 million**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $56,144 / (1 + 7.76%)^5 = **$38,555 million**
*   *Enterprise Value = $8,942 + $38,555 = **$47,497 million***

21) **Equity Value**:
*   *Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
*   *Equity Value = $47,497M - ($11,350M - $550M) = **$36,697 million***

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

22) **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**:
*   Projected Shares in Year 5 = 285M * (1 - 1.2%)^5 = 268 million shares.
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $36,697M / 268M shares = $136.93 per share**

23) **Valuation Range**:
*   **Base Case**: **$136.93**. Assumes 4-5% revenue growth, stable 35% margins, and a realistic 16.0x exit multiple.
*   **Low/Bear Case**: **$112.00**. Assumes 2% revenue growth, margin compression to 33%, and a 14.0x exit multiple.
*   **High/Bull Case**: **$160.00**. Assumes 6% revenue growth, slight margin expansion, and a 17.5x exit multiple.

24) **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**:
*   A 25% margin of safety from the base-case estimate provides a target purchase price.
*   *MOS Price = $136.93 * (1 - 0.25) = **$102.70***

**Risk Notes**

The key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Franchisee Health**: A significant portion of YUM's revenue comes from franchise fees; any deterioration in franchisee profitability could impact YUM's results. 2) **Competitive Pressure**: The Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry is intensely competitive, and failure to innovate in menu offerings and digital experience could lead to market share loss. 3) **Commodity and Labor Inflation**: Sustained high inflation in key inputs like chicken, packaging, and labor could pressure franchisee margins and, consequently, YUM's ability to grow its royalty stream. 4) **International Exposure**: Significant operations in China and other international markets expose the company to geopolitical risks, currency fluctuations, and varying consumer preferences.
