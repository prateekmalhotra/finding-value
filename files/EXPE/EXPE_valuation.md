### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | **6.0%** | Based on the most recent quarter's year-over-year growth and continued strength in the B2B segment. This is a conservative estimate reflecting management's commentary on a muted US consumer market. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call) |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)**| **12.15%** | The TTM operating margin is used and held constant. While management noted EBITDA margin expansion, without specific initiatives for operating margin improvement, a stable margin is a conservative base-case. (StockAnalysis) |
| **Tax Rate** | **21.55%** | The effective tax rate over the trailing twelve months is used as a baseline for future projections. (StockAnalysis) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **5.6%** | Based on the TTM Capex ($781M) as a percentage of TTM Revenue ($14,018M). (StockAnalysis) |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **3.2%** | Based on TTM Stock-Based Compensation ($443M) as a percentage of TTM Revenue ($14,018M). (StockAnalysis) |
| **∆WC as % of ∆ Revenue** | **4.3%** | Based on the TTM Change in Working Capital ($338M) as a percentage of the change in revenue from the prior TTM period. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EBIT** | $1,805 | $1,914 | $2,028 | $2,150 | $2,279 |

| **FCFF** | **$892** | **$951** | **$1,014** | **$1,081** | **$1,153** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | | **CAPM = Rf + β * ERP** |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.29% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. (YCharts, Aug 20, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP)| 5.0% | Standard market premium for a mature market. |
| Beta (β) | 1.61 | Reflects higher volatility than the market average, consistent with the cyclical travel industry. (StockAnalysis, 5-Year) |
| **Calculated Ke** | **12.34%** | 4.29% + 1.61 * 5.0% |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | | **Interest Expense / Avg. Debt** |
| Interest Expense | $239 M | (StockAnalysis) |
| Total Debt | $6,497 M | (StockAnalysis) |
| **Calculated Kd** | **3.68%** | $239 / $6,497 |
| Tax Rate | 21.55% | (StockAnalysis) |
| **After-Tax Kd** | **2.89%** | 3.68% * (1 - 0.2155) |
| **WACC** | | **(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-T))** |
| Market Cap (E) | $25,450 M | (StockAnalysis) |
| Total Debt (D) | $6,497 M | (StockAnalysis) |
| V = E + D | $31,947 M | |
| **Calculated WACC** | **10.45%** | (25,450/31,947 * 12.34%) + (6,497/31,947 * 2.89%) |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method**| | **TV = [FCFF(5) * (1+g)] / (WACC - g)** |
| Terminal Growth (g) | 2.5% | Long-run inflation expectation. |
| Terminal Value | **$14,917 M** | [$1,153 * (1.025)] / (10.45% - 2.5%) |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| | **TV = EBITDA(5) * Exit Multiple** |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $3,438 M | (EBIT(5) + D&A(5)) |
| Exit Multiple | 8.0x | A conservative multiple below the historical average to reflect potential slower long-term growth. |
| Terminal Value | **$27,504 M** | $3,438 * 8.0 |
| **Selected Terminal Value**| **$14,917 M** | The lower value from the Gordon Growth Method is selected for conservatism. |

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (in millions) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF | $3,889 | Sum of discounted FCFF from Y1-Y5 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $8,998 | $14,917 / (1+10.45%)^5 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)**| **$12,887** | **$3,889 + $8,998** |
| Less: Total Debt | ($6,497) | (StockAnalysis) |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents| $6,304 | (StockAnalysis) |
| **Equity Value** | **$12,694** | **$12,887 - $6,497 + $6,304** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Component | Value | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity Value | $12,694 M | From Equity Bridge |
| Diluted Shares | 135 M | (StockAnalysis) |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$94.03** | **$12,694 / 135** |
| **Valuation Range** | | |
| Low/Bear Case | **$70** | Assumes 3% revenue growth and 11% operating margin. |
| High/Bull Case | **$125** | Assumes 8% revenue growth and 13% operating margin. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (25%)** | **$70.52** | $94.03 * (1 - 0.25) |

### **One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include intense competition from other online travel agencies and direct suppliers, which could pressure revenue growth and margins. The business is highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions; a consumer spending slowdown, as hinted at in recent management commentary, could significantly reduce discretionary travel spending. Furthermore, changes in relationships with large partners or shifts in search engine algorithms could adversely affect customer acquisition costs and traffic.
