### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toll Brothers caters to a wide range of homebuyers, including luxury first-time, move-up, empty-nester, active-adult, and second-home buyers. The company has a significant backlog of $6.84 billion (6,063 homes) as of April 30, 2025. They are also expanding into the rental market with Toll Brothers Apartment Living® and Toll Brothers Campus Living®, with approximately 21,300 planned or completed units as of October 31, 2024. The company believes the long-term outlook for the new home market remains positive due to favorable demographics, a structural undersupply of homes in the U.S., and the aging stock of existing homes.

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toll Brothers has a strong brand reputation in the luxury homebuilding market. Their land acquisition strategy, which includes the use of option agreements, helps mitigate risk and manage capital efficiently. The company's ability to offer a high degree of customization and a wide range of options is a key differentiator. Their vertical integration through subsidiaries in mortgage, title, and manufacturing provides greater control over the value chain.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toll Brothers' strategy of land banking and developing master-planned communities, which can take several years to complete, demonstrates a long-range outlook. Their expansion into the rental market through Toll Brothers Apartment Living is a long-term investment in a recurring revenue stream. The company's consistent investment in land and development, even during market fluctuations, suggests a focus on long-term growth over short-term profits.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of April 30, 2025, Toll Brothers had $686.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $2.19 billion available under its revolving credit facility. The company has a history of share repurchases, having bought back $204.9 million of its common stock in the six months ended April 30, 2025.

**Synthesis:**
Toll Brothers scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its market position, management stability, and financial strength. The company's long-term strategy, including its expansion into the rental market and its disciplined land acquisition approach, positions it well for future growth. The primary negative is the lack of detailed public information on labor relations, which prevents a "Yes" on that point. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the performance of the broader housing market, particularly in the luxury segment, and the successful execution of its expansion into new product lines and geographic areas. A sustained downturn in the housing market could pressure margins and sales, while continued success in the rental and affordable luxury segments would reinforce the company's growth runway. To change the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes," the company would need to provide more transparency on employee satisfaction and turnover metrics.
