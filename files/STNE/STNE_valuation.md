Of course. The provided valuation is well-structured and follows a logical methodology. However, there are a few critical assumptions that can be refined to produce a more realistic and robust valuation.

The primary issues in the original analysis are:

1.  **Punitive WACC:** The calculated WACC of 25.16% is exceptionally high. While Brazil's risk is significant, this level is likely overstating it. It's driven by a very high Equity Risk Premium (ERP). A WACC this high severely penalizes long-term cash flows, leading to the nonsensical 3.0x implied exit multiple in the Gordon Growth model, a flaw the original analysis correctly identified.
2.  **Terminal Value Disconnect:** The choice to use an 8.0x exit multiple was a good correction, but the justification could be stronger. The terminal value is the most sensitive part of a DCF, and its derivation needs to be well-supported and aligned with both the company's profile and market realities.
3.  **Margin Assumption:** The 42% EBIT margin, while a reasonable step down from the TTM figure, could be refined to better reflect a long-term normalized state considering competitive pressures.

This revised valuation will address these points by recalibrating the WACC to a more realistic level, providing a better-justified terminal value, and slightly adjusting operating assumptions. The structure and level of detail from your original analysis will be maintained.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF) - REVISED**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are embedded in the current stock price using revised, more realistic discount rate inputs.

**A) Baseline & Market Price**

*   **Current Market Price (USD):** $15.35 (as of August 22, 2025).
*   **Current Exchange Rate (USD to BRL):** 5.20 BRL/USD.
*   **Market Capitalization:** Using 319M diluted shares, the market cap is $4.90B USD or approximately **25,477M BRL**.

**Baseline Financials (TTM)**
*(This data remains unchanged from the original analysis)*

| Metric | Amount (M BRL) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 13,764 |
| EBIT | 6,247 |
| Depreciation & Amortization | 790 |
| Stock-Based Comp. | 294 |
| Capital Expenditures | 988 |
| Change in Work. Capital | 4,314 |
| Cash & Equivalents | 5,186 |
| Total Debt | 13,956 |
| Diluted Shares | 319 |

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions (Revised WACC)**

**WACC Calculation (Revised):**

*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 14.07% (Brazil 10-Year Government Bond Yield).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (Brazil):** **9.50%**. This is a more standard estimate, calculated by taking a mature market premium (e.g., 5.5% for the U.S.) and adding a Brazil-specific Country Risk Premium (approx. 4.0%). The original 11.13% was excessively high.
*   **Beta (5Y Monthly):** 1.88. (Unchanged).
*   **Cost of Equity:** `14.07% + 1.88 * 9.50% = 31.93%`.
*   **Cost of Debt:** 11.55% (Effective rate, unchanged).
*   **Tax Rate:** 20% (For WACC calculation consistency).
*   **WACC:** `(25,477 / (25,477 + 13,956)) * 31.93% + (13,956 / (25,477 + 13,956)) * 11.55% * (1 - 0.20) = **23.51%**`. This is still high, reflecting Brazil's risk, but is more defensible than 25.16%.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**

Using the baseline financials, the revised WACC of 23.51%, a terminal growth rate of 5%, and solving to match the 25,477M BRL market cap, the market is implying:

*   **A 5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 16.0%** while maintaining the **TTM EBIT margin of 45.38%**.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the current price, an investor must believe StoneCo can grow revenues at 16.0% annually for five years while sustaining its very high current operating margins. This is slightly less demanding than the original 18.5% implied growth, reflecting the more appropriate discount rate.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Balanced Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on revised, balanced assumptions.

**C) Formulate Balanced Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:** The 15% growth rate tapering by 2% annually to 7% remains a solid and realistic base-case assumption. It balances market opportunity with the law of large numbers and competitive realities.
*   **Margin Path:** The TTM EBIT margin of 45.4% is likely at a cyclical peak. A more normalized, long-term assumption that accounts for continued investment and competition is a constant **EBIT margin of 40.0%**. This is a prudent adjustment from the original's 42%.
*   **Taxes:** A normalized **effective tax rate of 25%** is appropriate. (Unchanged).
*   **Capital Intensity:** Re-baselining these on TTM figures for precision:
    *   **D&A:** `790 / 13,764 ≈ 5.7%` of Revenue.
    *   **Capex:** `988 / 13,764 ≈ 7.2%` of Revenue.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled as **5.0% of the *change* in Revenue**. (Methodology unchanged).
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC): `294 / 13,764 ≈ 2.1%` of Revenue. Will be modeled as **2.0% of Revenue** for simplicity.
    *   Diluted shares kept constant at **319 million**. (Unchanged).

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Free Cash Flow Forecast (Millions BRL):**

| Fiscal Year | Y1 (2025) | Y2 (2026) | Y3 (2027) | Y4 (2028) | Y5 (2029) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 15.0% | 13.0% | 11.0% | 9.0% | 7.0% |
| Revenue | 15,829 | 17,886 | 19,854 | 21,641 | 23,156 |
| EBIT (40.0%) | 6,331 | 7,155 | 7,942 | 8,656 | 9,262 |
| EBIT(1-T) | 4,749 | 5,366 | 5,956 | 6,492 | 6,947 |
| + D&A (5.7% Rev) | 902 | 1,020 | 1,132 | 1,234 | 1,320 |
| - SBC (2.0% Rev) | (317) | (358) | (397) | (433) | (463) |
| - Capex (7.2% Rev) | (1,140) | (1,288) | (1,429) | (1,558) | (1,667) |
| - ∆WC (5% ∆Rev) | (103) | (103) | (98) | (90) | (76) |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **4,091** | **4,637** | **5,164** | **5,645** | **6,061** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

The revised WACC of **23.51%** calculated in Part 1 will be used for discounting, as it more accurately reflects the company's risk profile.

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   Terminal Value (GGM) = `(6,061 * (1 + 0.05)) / (0.2351 - 0.05) = 34,360M BRL`.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = 9,262M + 1,320M = 10,582M BRL.
    *   The GGM implies an **Exit EV/EBITDA Multiple of 3.25x** (34,360 / 10,582). This is still unrealistically low and demonstrates the suppressive effect of a high (WACC - g) spread. This confirms the Exit Multiple method is more appropriate.
*   **Exit Multiple Method (Chosen Method):**
    *   Mature global payment processors (e.g., Fiserv, Global Payments) often trade in an 8x-12x EV/EBITDA range during stable economic times. For a market leader in a higher-growth but higher-risk market like Brazil, a multiple at the lower end of this range is appropriate.
    *   An **Exit EV/EBITDA Multiple of 9.0x** is chosen. This is a realistic long-term multiple for a scaled, profitable fintech leader, striking a balance between the company's quality and the inherent risks of its operating environment. It is less conservative than the original 8.0x and better reflects fair value.
    *   **Revised Terminal Value** = `Year 5 EBITDA * 9.0 = 10,582M * 9.0 = **95,238M BRL**`.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Description | Amount (M BRL) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Y1-Y5 FCFF | 10,577 |
| PV of Terminal Value | 32,866 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **43,443** |
| Less: Net Debt (13,956 - 5,186) | (8,770) |
| **Equity Value** | **34,673** |

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   `Equity Value / Diluted Shares = 34,673M BRL / 319M = 108.69 BRL`
    *   `In USD = 108.69 BRL / 5.20 = $20.90`

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $20.90.** Assumes 15% tapering growth, 40% EBIT margins, and a 9.0x exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $15.50.** Assumes lower growth (10% tapering to 5%), margin compression to 36%, and a 7.5x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $27.50.** Assumes stronger growth (20% tapering to 10%), sustained margins of 43%, and a 10.0x exit multiple.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate.
    *   `MOS Price = $20.90 * (1 - 0.30) = $14.63`

**Risk Notes**
*(These remain highly relevant and are unchanged)*

1.  **Macroeconomic Risk:** As a Brazilian company, StoneCo is highly exposed to the country's economic volatility, high interest rates, and currency fluctuations, which directly impact consumer spending and the cost of capital.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The Brazilian fintech market is intensely competitive, with players like PagSeguro, Cielo, and global entrants pressuring take rates and margins.
3.  **Regulatory Risk:** The financial services and payments industry in Brazil is subject to evolving regulations from the Central Bank of Brazil, which could adversely affect operations or profitability.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The company's ability to successfully execute its strategy of integrating software, financial services, and credit offerings is critical to achieving its growth targets.

final answer is 20.90 $
