Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2024; The Clorox Company Earnings Call Transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Clorox Company's portfolio is concentrated in mature markets, but it holds significant brand power, with about 80% of its sales coming from brands that are #1 or #2 in their respective categories. The company's "IGNITE" strategy is focused on driving growth through innovation and evolving its portfolio, as evidenced by the recent divestitures of its Argentina and Better Health VMS businesses to focus on its core, more profitable segments. While a mature company, its focus on innovation in core categories like cleaning and household products, combined with its strong market position, provides a foundation for continued, albeit moderate, sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is heavily invested in future development through its IGNITE strategy and a significant capital allocation towards digital transformation. The company is in the midst of a five-year investment, estimated at $560 to $580 million, to replace its enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and implement a suite of other digital technologies. This long-term project is designed to "generate efficiencies and transform the Company's operations in the areas of supply chain, digital commerce, innovation, brand building and more over the long term." This demonstrates a clear commitment to developing processes that will support future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Clorox spent $89 million on research and development, representing approximately 1.7% of its $5.12 billion in net sales. This spending level is consistent with its consumer staples peers. The effectiveness of this spending is demonstrated by a steady stream of product innovations, such as the recently launched Pine-Sol concentrated multi-surface cleaners and Clorox Toilet Bomb Foaming Toilet Bowl Cleaner, which support its leading brand positioning. The company's ability to maintain approximately 80% of its sales from #1 or #2 market share brands indicates that its R&D is effective at sustaining its competitive position.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox utilizes a multi-channel sales approach including a direct sales force for mass retailers and a network of brokers for grocery stores and wholesalers, supplemented by growing e-commerce channels. The strength of its sales organization is evidenced by its deep relationship with key customers; its largest customer, Walmart, accounted for 26% of consolidated net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2025. The ability to maintain leading market share for the majority of its brands across these major retail channels points to an effective and above-average sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Clorox's gross margin was 44.7%, a 300 basis point increase from 41.7% in the prior-year period. This indicates effective cost management and pricing power. The improvement was primarily driven by cost savings and the net impacts of higher volume and the strategic divestitures of lower-margin businesses. This level of gross margin is robust for the consumer staples industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm) (Filed May 5, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox is actively engaged in margin improvement through multiple initiatives. A key action was the implementation of a new streamlined operating model, completed in fiscal year 2024, which is expected to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $100 million. The company also strategically divested its Argentina and Better Health VMS businesses to "reduce volatility, accelerate sales growth and structurally improve margins." The most recent quarterly report cites cost savings and the benefits from these divestitures as primary drivers for its 240 basis point gross margin expansion in the third quarter of fiscal 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm) (Filed May 5, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K provides strong evidence of positive personnel relations through its Human Capital Management disclosures. In fiscal year 2024, 82% of employees reported feeling engaged at Clorox, a figure above the 50th percentile for Fortune 500 and industry benchmarks. The company's workplace safety record is also strong, with a fiscal year 2024 reportable incident rate (RIR) of 0.47, significantly lower than the 3.2 average for goods-producing manufacturing companies. Clorox also highlights its commitment to inclusion and diversity, with women making up 48% of global senior executives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a significant depth of experience within the company. Chair and CEO Linda Rendle has been with the company since 2003, and CFO Kevin Jacobsen joined in 1995. Many other members of the executive team have similarly long tenures, indicating a stable and cohesive leadership environment. The company's Human Capital disclosures also mention a "robust talent review and leader succession planning process to ensure a strong pipeline for key roles," suggesting a structured approach to executive continuity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox's executive leadership team, as detailed in its 2024 10-K, is broad and covers all key functional and operational areas. Beyond the CEO and CFO, the company has Group Presidents for its major segments (e.g., Health and Hygiene, Care and Connection) as well as a Chief Operating and Strategy Officer, Chief People and Corporate Affairs Officer, and Chief Legal Officer. This structure demonstrates a deep bench of senior executives with clear responsibilities, mitigating key person risk and ensuring comprehensive management oversight across the enterprise.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox provides detailed segment reporting, including a reconciliation of segment adjusted EBIT to consolidated earnings before taxes, allowing for clear cost and profitability analysis by division. In its most recent 10-Q filing, management concluded that as of March 31, 2025, the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The company is currently undergoing a major implementation of a new ERP system, which represents a significant investment in upgrading its accounting and control systems for the long term.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the consumer packaged goods industry, brand equity and market share are the most critical indicators of competitive strength. Clorox excels in this area, stating that approximately 80% of its sales are generated from brands holding the #1 or #2 market share position in their categories. This brand dominance creates a significant competitive moat, providing pricing power and securing valuable retail shelf space. The company's joint venture with Procter & Gamble for the Glad business is another unique arrangement that has provided long-term R&D and market support.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a long-range outlook through significant, multi-year strategic investments. The company is investing an estimated $560-$580 million over five years in a digital transformation and ERP system replacement, which causes near-term expenses for the sake of long-term efficiency and operational improvement. Furthermore, the decisions to divest the Argentina and VMS businesses, while resulting in short-term losses on sale, were explicitly made to "reduce volatility, accelerate sales growth, and structurally improve margins" over the long run. These actions show a willingness to absorb short-term costs to achieve a more profitable and stable long-term business structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm) (Filed May 5, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position appears strong enough to preclude the need for dilutive equity financing. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Clorox generated $687 million in cash from operations. During this period, the company used cash not to issue shares, but to return capital to shareholders, paying $452 million in dividends and repurchasing $257 million of its own stock. Clorox maintains stock repurchase programs specifically to offset dilution from stock-based employee compensation, further demonstrating a commitment to preventing dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm) (Filed May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000040/clx-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000040/clx-20240930.htm) (Filed October 30, 2024)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a track record of transparency during difficult periods. The most prominent recent example is the August 2023 cyberattack. In its subsequent 10-Q and 10-K filings, the company provided specific details on the "wide-scale disruptions to the Company's business operations," the negative impact on net sales and earnings, the costs incurred for remediation, and the amounts recovered from insurance. This level of detail about a significant negative event, rather than offering vague commentary, demonstrates a high degree of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm) (Filed May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings reveals no significant legal or regulatory issues that would call management's integrity into question. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K states that the company is subject to "routine litigation incidental to its business" but does not expect the outcomes to have a material adverse effect. The company has a publicly available Code of Conduct, and there are no disclosed related-party transactions, audit issues, or governance red flags in the primary filings reviewed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm) (Filed August 8, 2024)

---
**Synthesis:**
The Clorox Company scores highly across Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a well-managed, shareholder-friendly business with a strong competitive position. Its primary strengths lie in its dominant brand portfolio, stable and experienced management team, and a clear long-term strategy focused on margin improvement and operational efficiency. The company is not resting on its laurels, as shown by its significant investment in digital transformation and the strategic pruning of its portfolio to focus on core strengths. While it operates in mature markets, its commitment to innovation and brand support allows it to maintain its leadership position and generate strong cash flows.

The two variables most likely to change this score in the next 12–24 months are the execution of its ERP system implementation and the sustainability of its margin improvements. A successful ERP rollout would solidify the "Yes" answers for cost controls and long-range planning, while any major disruptions could call them into question. Similarly, if the margin gains from recent cost-cutting and divestitures prove temporary or are eroded by competitive pressure and inflation, the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" and "Margin Improvement Actions" points would require re-evaluation. To maintain its perfect score, Clorox will need to demonstrate continued organic sales growth in its core portfolio and prove that its strategic investments are yielding the anticipated efficiencies and returns.

**Fisher Score is 15 / 15**
