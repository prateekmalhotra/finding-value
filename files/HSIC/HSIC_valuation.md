**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market-implied growth rate, we first establish the company's Enterprise Value (EV) and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

*   **Market Capitalization:** $69.60/share * 125 million shares = $8,700 million
*   **Net Debt:** $3,358 million (Total Debt) - $145 million (Cash) = $3,213 million
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $8,700 million + $3,213 million = **$11,913 million**

The WACC is calculated as follows:
*   **Cost of Equity (Ke):** 4.26% (10-Yr Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025) + 0.81 (5-Year Beta) * 5.0% (Equity Risk Premium) = **8.31%**
*   **Cost of Debt (Kd):** $142M (Interest Expense) / $3,358M (Total Debt) = 4.23%. After-tax Kd = 4.23% * (1 - 0.2429) = **3.20%**
*   **WACC:** (8,700 / 12,058 * 8.31%) + (3,358 / 12,058 * 3.20%) = **6.88%**

Using the current EV of $11,913 million, a WACC of 6.88%, and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, the calculation reveals that **to justify the current stock price of $69.60, the market is pricing in a 5-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.6%.** This implies a belief in steady, mid-single-digit growth for the foreseeable future.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (BALANCED BASE-CASE)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on a balanced interpretation of historical performance and future prospects.

**C) FORMULATE BALANCED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6-11) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **4.0% tapering to 3.0%** | The market's implied 5.6% seems optimistic, while the original's 3.5% was overly conservative given historical acquisitions. A 4.0% initial growth rate reflects a blend of organic growth and smaller bolt-on acquisitions, tapering to a mature growth rate of 3.0%. |
| **Operating Margin** | **6.10% (Stable)** | Based on the 3-year average operating margin (FY22-24) of 6.27% and the TTM margin of 6.01%. As a mature distributor, assuming significant margin expansion is aggressive; stability is a prudent and realistic base case. |
| **Tax Rate** | **23.0%** | The average effective tax rate over the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024) was approximately 23.0%. This normalizes for annual fluctuations. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.1%** | The 3-year average (FY22-24) Capex as a percentage of revenue is 1.1%. This reflects a stable and predictable capital intensity. |
| **Change in WC** | **1.5% of total revenue** | **Correction:** Calculating Change in WC from *incremental* revenue is highly volatile. A more stable method is to tie it to *total* revenue. The TTM Change in WC ($181M) represents 1.42% of TTM revenue. An assumption of 1.5% of total revenue is a more reliable and slightly conservative forecast for a distribution business. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.3%** | The 3-year average (FY22-24) for stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue. |
| **Share Count Reduction** | **-1.5% annually** | The diluted share count has decreased by an average of 3.4% annually over the last three years. A net reduction of 1.5% is a balanced estimate accounting for ongoing buybacks offset by dilution from SBC. |

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Build**
FCFF is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $13,284 | $13,762 | $14,249 | $14,726 | $15,168 |
| EBIT (6.10% margin) | $810 | $840 | $869 | $898 | $925 |
| NOPAT (23% tax) | $624 | $647 | $669 | $692 | $712 |
| (+) D&A | $286 | $296 | $306 | $317 | $326 |
| (-) SBC | $40 | $41 | $43 | $44 | $45 |
| (-) Capex | $146 | $151 | $157 | $162 | $167 |
| (-) Change in WC | $199 | $206 | $214 | $221 | $228 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$525** | **$544** | **$562** | **$581** | **$599** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14-16) WACC Calculation**
The WACC calculated in Part 1 remains appropriate as the company's capital structure and risk profile are not expected to change materially.
*   **Cost of Equity (Ke):** 8.31%
*   **Cost of Debt (Kd, After-Tax):** 3.20%
*   **WACC:** **6.88%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17-18) Terminal Value Calculation**
The Gordon Growth method is used as the primary determinant for its theoretical soundness in valuing a mature, stable company.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This is a reasonable proxy for long-term global GDP growth and inflation, representing a sustainable perpetual growth rate.
*   **Terminal Value Formula:** (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
*   **Terminal Value:** ($599 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0688 - 0.025) = **$14,025 million**

*   **Cross-Check (Exit Multiple Method):**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($925M) + Year 5 D&A ($326M) = $1,251M.
    *   The company's current EV/EBITDA multiple is ~11.5x ($11,913M / $1,038M). A long-term median for a stable healthcare distributor is in the 11x-13x range. Using a reasonable 12.0x exit multiple:
    *   Implied Terminal Value = $1,251M * 12.0 = **$15,012 million**.
    *   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth TV of $14,025M and the Exit Multiple TV of $15,012M are well-aligned. This provides confidence in the assumptions. The Gordon Growth model implies an exit EV/EBITDA multiple of $14,025M / $1,251M = **11.2x**, which is a realistic and even slightly conservative multiple for a terminal year. The **$14,025 million** value will be used.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Present Value Calculation**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($525/1.0688¹) + ($544/1.0688²) + ($562/1.0688³) + ($581/1.0688⁴) + ($599/1.0688⁵) = $491 + $476 + $460 + $444 + $428 = **$2,300 million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $14,025 / (1.0688)⁵ = **$10,042 million**
*   **Enterprise Value:** $2,300 million + $10,042 million = **$12,342 million**

**20) Equity Value Calculation**
*   **Equity Value Formula:** Enterprise Value - Net Debt
*   **Equity Value:** $12,342 million - $3,213 million = **$9,129 million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**
*   **Projected Shares in Year 5:** 125 million * (1 - 0.015)⁵ = 115.9 million shares
*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** $9,129 million / 115.9 million shares = **$78.77 per share**

**22) Valuation Range**
*   **Base Case: $78.77.** Assumes 4.0% tapering to 3.0% revenue growth and stable 6.1% operating margins.
*   **Bear Case: ~$60.** Assumes ~2.0% revenue growth and margin compression to 5.7%, with a lower exit multiple of 10.0x.
*   **Bull Case: ~$98.** Assumes ~5.0% revenue growth, modest margin expansion to 6.3%, and a higher exit multiple of 12.5x.

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**
A 25% margin of safety is appropriate for a stable, wide-moat business like HSIC, providing a buffer against forecasting errors.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** $78.77 * (1 - 0.25) = **$59.08**

**Risk Notes**
Key risks to this valuation thesis include: 1) **Competition:** Intense competition in the healthcare distribution market could pressure margins. 2) **Reimbursement Risk:** Changes in healthcare reimbursement policies could negatively affect demand from dental and medical practitioners. 3) **Integration Risk:** The company frequently makes acquisitions, and failure to successfully integrate them could lead to operational inefficiencies and goodwill impairments. 4) **Supply Chain Disruptions:** Global supply chain vulnerabilities could impact product availability and costs. 5) **Economic Sensitivity:** Dental procedures, a key driver, can be sensitive to consumer discretionary spending during economic downturns.

final answer is 78.77 $
