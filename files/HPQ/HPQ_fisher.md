**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's core markets, Personal Systems and Printing, are mature and cyclical. While the company is focusing on growth areas like gaming peripherals, hybrid work solutions, and industrial graphics and 3D printing, these are not yet large enough to offset the slow growth of the core businesses. The company's "Future Ready" plan aims to optimize the core business and invest in these growth areas, but a sizable increase in overall sales remains a challenge.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's management is focused on a "Future Ready" strategy that involves investing in key growth areas. This includes a multi-year plan to invest in areas like hybrid systems, gaming, and industrial solutions. The company's acquisition of Poly (now HP Poly) and its ongoing investments in 3D printing and other growth areas demonstrate a commitment to developing new products and services.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's R&D spending is significant in absolute terms but has been declining as a percentage of revenue and is lower than some of its key competitors. While the company continues to innovate, particularly in areas like 3D printing and advanced personal systems, there is no clear evidence that its R&D is more effective than its competitors in generating new growth streams.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP has a broad and well-established global sales and distribution network that includes a mix of direct sales, resellers, and partners. The company's large scale and long-standing relationships with channel partners are a key advantage. However, there's no strong evidence to suggest its sales organization is significantly more effective than its primary competitors in the PC and printing markets.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's profit margins are relatively thin, which is characteristic of the PC and printer hardware business. While the company has been able to maintain and slightly improve margins through cost controls and a focus on higher-value products, its margins are not what would be considered high, especially when compared to software or other technology sectors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721725000043/hpq-20250430.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's "Future Ready" plan is a significant initiative aimed at improving margins. This includes a multi-year restructuring plan to reduce costs, as well as a focus on shifting the product mix towards more profitable segments like gaming, peripherals, and industrial printing. The company is also focused on driving efficiencies in its supply chain.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant labor disputes or widespread employee dissatisfaction at HP. However, the company has undergone significant restructuring and workforce reductions as part of its "Future Ready" plan. While these actions are aimed at improving efficiency, they can also impact employee morale. Without more specific positive evidence, it's difficult to classify their labor relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at HP, led by CEO Enrique Lores, appears to be stable and aligned on the company's "Future Ready" strategy. There have been no recent reports of significant executive turnover or internal conflicts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP has a well-defined management structure with experienced executives leading its various business segments. The company's public filings and investor presentations outline the roles and responsibilities of its key leaders, suggesting a professional and deep management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, publicly traded company, HP has robust accounting and financial reporting processes. The company provides detailed segment-level financial data, and its internal controls over financial reporting are regularly audited. There are no recent reports of significant accounting issues or material weaknesses in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721725000043/hpq-20250430.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the printer business, HP has a significant "razor-and-blade" model with its supplies business, which provides a recurring revenue stream. However, this model is under pressure from third-party suppliers. In the PC business, the company's scale and supply chain efficiency are key competitive advantages, but the industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's "Future Ready" plan, which involves significant upfront investment and restructuring charges, indicates a willingness to prioritize long-term profitability over short-term results. The company's focus on investing in growth areas like 3D printing and hybrid work solutions also points to a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, rather than issuing new shares. This indicates that the company is not likely to dilute shareholders to fund its growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721725000043/hpq-20250430.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's management team regularly communicates with investors through earnings calls, investor presentations, and SEC filings. They provide detailed financial information and commentary on business trends, both positive and negative. There is no evidence to suggest a lack of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HPQ/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent, significant legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of HP's management. The company has a corporate governance framework in place and operates in a transparent manner.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
HP Inc. presents a mixed picture based on Fisher's 15 points. The company's strengths lie in its commitment to long-term development, a stable and deep management team, strong financial controls, and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy. However, the company faces significant challenges in its core, low-growth markets, which leads to a lack of a long runway for growth and thin profit margins. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the "Future Ready" plan in driving margin improvement and the ability of the company's growth initiatives in areas like 3D printing and hybrid work solutions to achieve meaningful scale. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" for "Products/Services with Long Runway" if these new businesses show sustained, high growth and become a more significant part of HP's overall revenue.

fisher score is 9 / 15
