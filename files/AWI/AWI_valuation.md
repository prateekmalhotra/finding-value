    *   **Net Sales:** $1,475 to $1,525 million (Midpoint: $1,500 million)
    *   **Adjusted EBITDA:** $460 to $480 million (Midpoint: $470 million)

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1:** 9.5% (to reach the midpoint of management's guidance of $1,500M from a TTM base of $1,351M).
    *   **Years 2-5:** A rate of 4.0% is used, reflecting a blend of historical performance and management's focus on growth initiatives, tapering towards a mature growth rate.
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin):** The TTM EBIT margin is 25.7%. The forecast will maintain this margin, assuming that cost inflation and productivity gains offset each other, in the absence of specific management guidance on margin expansion.
*   **Tax Rate:** The average effective tax rate over the last two years has been approximately 24-25%. A rate of **25.0%** is assumed for the forecast period.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Management guided 2025 capex to be $90-$100 million. The midpoint, **$95 million**, is used for Year 1. For subsequent years, Capex is modeled at **6.5% of revenue**, in line with historical averages.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled as **1.0% of incremental revenue**, consistent with historical patterns.
*   **SBC and Dilution:** Stock-based compensation is held at approximately **1.5% of revenue**. The latest reported diluted share count of **44.0 million** is used for the valuation.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers.

**FCFF Formula:** `EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in millions) | Year 1 (2025) | Year 2 (2026) | Year 3 (2027) | Year 4 (2028) | Year 5 (2029) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,500.0 | $1,560.0 | $1,622.4 | $1,687.3 | $1,754.8 |
| EBIT | $385.5 | $400.9 | $416.9 | $433.6 | $451.0 |
| NOPAT | $289.1 | $300.7 | $312.7 | $325.2 | $338.2 |
| D&A | $105.0 | $109.2 | $113.6 | $118.1 | $122.8 |
| SBC | ($22.5) | ($23.4) | ($24.3) | ($25.3) | ($26.3) |
| Capex | ($95.0) | ($101.4) | ($105.5) | ($109.7) | ($114.1) |
| Change in WC | ($1.5) | ($0.6) | ($0.6) | ($0.6) | ($0.7) |
| **FCFF** | **$275.1** | **$284.5** | **$295.9** | **$307.7** | **$319.9** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.5% (Current 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.20 (Sourced from Yahoo Finance, 5-year monthly). This beta is considered reasonable as it reflects the cyclicality of the building products industry.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.5% + 1.20 * 5.0% = 10.5%*
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense ($37.5M) / Average Total Debt ($644.0M) = 5.8%. After-tax cost = 5.8% * (1 - 25.0%) = 4.35%.
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Cap (approx. $4.9B) + Total Debt ($0.64B) = Enterprise Value of $5.54B.
    *   Equity Weight = 88.4%; Debt Weight = 11.6%.
    *   *WACC = (0.884 * 10.5%) + (0.116 * 4.35%) = 9.28% + 0.50% = 9.78%*

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   *Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($319.9 * 1.025) / (9.78% - 2.5%) = $327.9 / 0.0728 = $4,504 million*
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT ($451.0M) + D&A ($122.8M) = $573.8M
    *   A conservative 8.0x EV/EBITDA multiple is applied, in line with historical averages for the sector.
    *   *Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $573.8M * 8.0 = $4,590 million*
    *   The Gordon Growth value is slightly more conservative and will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of FCFF (Years 1-5): $1,159.2 million
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $4,504 million / (1 + 9.78%)^5 = $2,832.5 million
    *   *Enterprise Value = $1,159.2M + $2,832.5M = $3,991.7 million*
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Enterprise Value ($3,991.7M) - Total Debt ($644.0M) + Cash ($73.6M) = **$3,421.3 million** (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2024).

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Equity Value ($3,421.3M) / Diluted Shares (44.0M) = $77.76 per share*
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$77.76**
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($55.00):** Assumes lower revenue growth (2.0%), margin compression to 23.0%, and a higher discount rate (10.5%).
    *   **High/Bull Case ($100.00):** Assumes higher revenue growth (5.0%), slight margin expansion to 26.5%, and a lower discount rate (9.0%).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a target purchase price.
    *   *MOS Price = $77.76 * (1 - 0.30) = $54.43*

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Cyclicality of Construction:** AWI's performance is heavily tied to the health of the commercial and residential construction markets, which are cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions, interest rates, and office vacancy rates.
2.  **Input Cost Volatility:** The company is exposed to fluctuations in raw material and energy prices (e.g., fiberglass, perlite, natural gas). An inability to pass these costs on to customers could compress margins.
3.  **Competition:** The building products market is highly competitive. AWI faces pressure from other large manufacturers and alternative products like drywall, which could impact pricing power and market share.
4.  **Integration Risk:** AWI has a strategy of growing through acquisitions. Failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses could disrupt operations and prevent the realization of expected synergies.
5.  **Dependence on Key Distributors:** A significant portion of sales is concentrated with a few large distributors. The loss of, or a significant change in the relationship with, these key customers could adversely affect revenue.

final answer is 77.76 $
