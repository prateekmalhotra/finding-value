**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information regarding employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations is not available in the provided search results.

**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The co-founders remain actively involved in the company's leadership, with David Allemann serving as Executive Co-Chairman.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The search results primarily focus on the Co-Founder and the CEO/CFO. While it is clear the company has a leadership team, there is insufficient information to assess the depth of management beyond the top executives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's ability to provide detailed financial reporting, including segment information and constant currency growth rates, suggests a sophisticated level of cost analysis and accounting. However, the recent significant net loss due to foreign exchange impacts highlights a potential weakness in managing financial risks. Without further information on the company's internal controls and audit history, a definitive "Yes" is not warranted.
**Answer:** No

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On's unique CloudTec® sole technology provides a distinct product differentiation in the highly competitive sportswear market.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent investment in global expansion, new product categories, and its own retail stores, even at the expense of short-term profitability, suggests a long-range outlook. The focus on building a premium brand and a strong DTC channel also points to a long-term strategy. The willingness to raise guidance despite a quarterly net loss further supports this view.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On Holding AG ended Q2 2025 with a strong cash position of CHF 846.6 million. The company's strong revenue growth and healthy margins provide a solid foundation for funding future growth through operating cash flow. While the company had a net loss in the most recent quarter due to currency fluctuations, its operational profitability remains strong.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company openly addressed the Q2 2025 earnings miss and the impact of foreign exchange headwinds in its earnings call. Management provided detailed explanations for the net loss while also highlighting the underlying strength of the business. This transparency in the face of negative results is a positive indicator of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the search results to suggest any issues with management's integrity. The company's filings and communications appear to be straightforward. However, without a more in-depth review of corporate governance and related-party transactions, a definitive "Yes" cannot be given.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

Synthesis:
On Holding AG scores well on Fisher's checklist in areas related to its products, sales growth, and profitability. The company has a strong brand, innovative products, and a rapidly growing direct-to-consumer business that is driving margin expansion. The biggest unknowns are in the qualitative aspects of the business, such as R&D effectiveness, labor relations, and management depth, where more information is needed for a full assessment. The score could be most impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to sustain its high growth rate, manage the impact of currency fluctuations, and provide more transparency into its R&D and management structure. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness with more disclosure on spending and innovation pipeline, and for management depth with more visibility into the leadership team beyond the top executives.

fisher score is 9 / 15
