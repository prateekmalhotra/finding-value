Company: Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K (filed February 25, 2025), Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (July 29, 2025).

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Armstrong is demonstrating strong growth in its Architectural Specialties (AS) segment, which saw net sales grow 37% in Q2 2025, with 15% organic growth well above the market rate. This segment is being expanded through acquisitions (e.g., 3form, Zahner) into new adjacencies like specialty walls and exterior facades, allowing AWI to sell more products into the same buildings where its traditional Mineral Fiber ceilings are used. The company's strategy is to penetrate a large addressable market in commercial buildings, and recent performance indicates this is succeeding. For the first half of 2025, consolidated net sales grew 17%.
**Answer:** Yes

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is heavily invested in developing new product categories. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, the CEO provided a detailed update on TEMPLOK, a new-to-industry, energy-saving ceiling tile that utilizes phase change material and is now eligible for significant tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act. The company is also expanding its digital platforms, like ProjectWorks, an automated design service that helps drive specification of complex, high-value solutions. Furthermore, AWI's recent acquisitions of 3form and Zahner demonstrate a commitment to inorganic growth and portfolio expansion into new materials and applications.
**Answer:** Yes

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the 2024 10-K does not specify R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, the company's focus on "market-driven product innovation" has yielded tangible results. The full launch of the TEMPLOK product line in early 2024, a first-of-its-kind energy-saving ceiling tile, is a key output of R&D efforts. Management highlighted TEMPLOK's inclusion in the IES energy modeling software, a critical step for adoption by architects and engineers, suggesting effective R&D that is aligned with market needs. The continued enhancement of digital tools like ProjectWorks and Kanopi also demonstrates effective development.
**Answer:** Yes

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company achieved 15% organic growth in its Architectural Specialties segment in Q2 2025, which management explicitly states is "well above market activity levels," demonstrating strong market penetration. Management credits a "sales and marketing optimization program" and digital tools like ProjectWorks, which recently helped win a complex 4-story health center project featuring 32 unique Armstrong solutions. The 2024 10-K notes that two distributors, Foundation Building Materials, Inc. and GMS, Inc., accounted for over 10% of consolidated gross sales, indicating strong, established relationships with key channels.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (July 29, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm) (February 25, 2025)

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, AWI demonstrates strong and expanding profit margins. In Q2 2025, the consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by 200 basis points to 36%. The core Mineral Fiber segment reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 45%, a 350 basis point expansion and its best second-quarter result since 2016. The growing Architectural Specialties segment achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 22%, expanding by 310 basis points, and management has expressed confidence in its ability to deliver greater than 20% EBITDA margins in this segment going forward.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (July 29, 2025)

6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AWI is actively improving margins through several levers. The company is driving favorable Average Unit Value (AUV) through both like-for-like pricing and a better product mix, supported by innovation. In its Mineral Fiber segment, this resulted in a 5% AUV growth in Q2 2025. Management also highlighted "disciplined focus on cost control" and "strong productivity results" from its manufacturing plants as key contributors to margin expansion. In the Architectural Specialties segment, the company is gaining operating leverage on its cost base as sales grow.
**Answer:** Yes

7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states, "We believe that our relations with our employees are constructive and positive." As of December 31, 2024, approximately 52% of the U.S. production employees were represented by labor unions, with collective bargaining agreements covering about 180 employees at three plants set to expire in 2025. The company reports 2024 voluntary turnover rates of approximately 7% for non-production employees and 13% for production employees, which are reasonable for the manufacturing sector. The emphasis on safety as a core value is also a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm) (February 25, 2025)

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team demonstrates stability and a consistent strategic message across public communications, including the 2024 10-K and the Q2 2025 earnings call. CEO Victor Grizzle and CFO Christopher Calzaretta lead these calls, articulating a clear and consistent strategy focused on innovation, digital initiatives, and expansion of the AS segment. The successful integration of recent acquisitions, noted in the Q2 2025 call, suggests effective collaboration and alignment between the executive team and newly acquired management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (July 29, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm) (February 25, 2025)

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K and proxy statement (incorporated by reference) list a team of executive officers beyond the CEO and CFO, covering key functions like operations, sales, and general counsel. The Q2 2025 earnings call mentions the continuity of the management team at GMS, a key distributor being acquired by Home Depot, as a critical factor for AWI's ongoing success, indicating AWI values management depth in its partners and likely cultivates it internally. During the same call, the CEO praised the "professional, highly skilled management teams" at recently acquired companies, suggesting an ability to identify and retain talent through M&A.
**Answer:** Yes

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 Form 10-K includes "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting," in which management concluded that its internal controls were effective as of December 31, 2024. The company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion, stating that "the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024." There is no history of material weaknesses or significant restatements mentioned.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm) (February 25, 2025)

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the architectural products industry is the relationship with architects and designers who specify products. AWI is excelling here through its digital initiative, ProjectWorks, a software platform that simplifies the design of complex ceilings and walls for architects. Management cited this tool as a "unique competitive advantage" that helped secure a large health center project with 32 different AWI products, a breadth "no other single manufacturer could provide." This digital integration into the architectural design process creates a significant moat.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (July 29, 2025)

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's focus on and investment in the TEMPLOK product line, which is in the "early days" of a "long-term opportunity" to renovate a 40 billion square foot installed base, demonstrates a clear long-range outlook. This involves a multi-year "market development body of work" before significant sales are realized. The company's strategy to expand the Architectural Specialties segment through continued bolt-on acquisitions is another core element of its long-term growth plan, which it has been executing for years. The company's capital allocation priorities are, first, to invest back into the business for high-return projects, and second, to pursue inorganic growth, both of which favor long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4724810-armstrong-world-industries-inc-awi-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (July 29, 2025)

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, with a focus on returning capital to shareholders, not dilution. Year-to-date adjusted free cash flow increased 29% as of Q2 2025. The 2024 10-K details a $1.7 billion share repurchase program, under which the company bought back $55.0 million in shares in 2024 and had $661.8 million remaining authorization. In Q2 2025 alone, the company repurchased $30 million of shares. Strong cash flow and access to a $950 million senior credit facility provide ample liquidity for operations, capital expenditures, and bolt-on acquisitions without needing to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates candor by openly discussing potential headwinds while highlighting strong performance. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, the CEO stated, "we increased our efforts to improve efficiency throughout the business in anticipation of softer economic conditions ahead." He also acknowledged that "uncertainty on tariffs, inflation, labor and interest rates...is expected to slow commercial construction activity with the greatest impact likely on more discretionary type renovation projects." This balanced discussion of positive results and potential market challenges indicates a high degree of transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags suggesting a lack of integrity. The 2024 10-K notes that while the company is involved in various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business, management does not believe any current claims will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition. The company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal controls for the year ended December 31, 2024. The consistent and clear communication from management further supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm) (February 25, 2025)

Synthesis:
Armstrong World Industries scores perfectly across Fisher's 15 points based on current evidence. The company's strongest positives are its impressive and accelerating growth in the Architectural Specialties segment, its commitment to true product innovation like TEMPLOK, and its robust and expanding profit margins. The management team appears to be executing a clear and consistent long-term strategy effectively. The primary variable that could change this score in the next 12-24 months is the macroeconomic environment; management already anticipates a softer back half of 2025 due to economic uncertainty. A significant downturn in commercial construction could test the resilience of AWI's growth initiatives and margin improvement programs. Evidence that would be needed to flip a "Yes" to a "No" would include a sharp contraction in Architectural Specialties' organic growth rate, a failure of new products like TEMPLOK to gain meaningful market traction, or a significant deterioration in profit margins that cannot be explained by market conditions alone.

fisher score is 15 / 15
