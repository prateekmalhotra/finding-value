I have successfully gathered some initial data. I browsed an SEC filing, the company's earnings call transcript page, and an insider trading screener.

However, one of the SEC filing URLs failed to load. I will proceed with the information I have and will search for more if needed.

Here is the plan:
1.  **Analyze the insider trading data** from OpenInsider to identify any significant buying or selling trends.
2.  **Review the earnings call transcripts** to find management's forward-looking statements and guidance.
3.  **Search for the latest 10-K and 10-Q filings** to extract key financial data, growth metrics, and risk factors.
4. **Syntesize the information** to build out the complete catalyst report as requested by the user, following the specified output structure.

I will now proceed with step 1 and 2. Then I will conduct a search to find the necessary SEC filings and other relevant information to build the catalyst report.
Here's a summary of my initial findings:

*   **Insider Trading:** A quick look at OpenInsider shows a significant number of sales by executives and directors in the past year. This is not necessarily a negative sign, as insiders may sell for various reasons, but it's a point to consider. I will analyze this in more detail later.
*   **Earnings Call Transcripts:** The Discounting Cash Flows website provides a list of earnings call transcripts. I will analyze the most recent ones to understand management's tone and guidance.

I will now proceed with a search to find the latest financial reports and other relevant news to build a comprehensive catalyst analysis.I have now conducted a search for e.l.f. Beauty's investor relations information and found several useful links. I will now browse these links to find the latest financial reports (10-K, 10-Q), investor presentations, and press releases. This will provide the necessary data to perform the catalyst analysis.

I was not able to access the SEC filing url provided, and the search results didn't provide a direct link. So I will try another search to find the SEC filings page for ELF.I have successfully found several resources for e.l.f. Beauty's SEC filings. The search results provide links to the latest 10-Q, 8-K, and other relevant filings. I will now proceed to browse these filings to extract the necessary data for the catalyst analysis. I will prioritize the most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings to get a comprehensive view of the company's financial health and strategic initiatives. I will also look for any recent investor presentations or press releases that might contain information about potential catalysts.

I see a 10-Q from August 7th, 2025 in the search results. I'm going to browse the link for that filing.
I was unable to access the 10-Q filing directly through the provided URL. I will now try a broader search to find the filing on a different platform, and if that fails, I will rely on the information I can gather from the other search results and the previously browsed pages.

I will now search for the e.l.f. Beauty Inc. Q2 2025 10-Q filing and earnings release.I have gathered significant information from the search results, including details from the Q2 2025 earnings release and call. This information will allow me to construct the catalyst report.

Here is the key information I've gathered:

*   **Strong Financial Performance:** e.l.f. Beauty reported a 40% increase in net sales to $301.1 million in Q2 2025, marking their 23rd consecutive quarter of sales growth. Gross margin expanded to 71%, and the company raised its full-year 2025 outlook for net sales growth to 28-30%.
*   **Market Share Gains:** The company continues to gain market share, with a 195 basis point increase in the U.S. in Q2.
*   **International Growth:** International net sales grew by 91% in Q2, indicating a significant runway for international expansion.
*   **Acquisition of Rhode:** The company completed the acquisition of HRBeauty LLC (rhode) for $800 million, which is expected to be a significant growth driver.
*   **Insider Selling:** As noted before, there has been consistent selling by insiders, which is something to monitor. I will have to dig in more to the specifics of these sales.

Based on this information, I can now proceed with creating the catalyst report as requested by the user. I will structure the report according to the provided template, starting with the header and top 3 prioritized catalysts. I have enough information to provide a detailed and well-cited analysis.

Final Answer: I will now generate the catalyst report.
