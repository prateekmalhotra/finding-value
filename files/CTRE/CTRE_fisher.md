### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CareTrust REIT invests in healthcare-related properties, primarily skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) and assisted living facilities (ALFs). This market is supported by powerful long-term demographic tailwinds, namely the aging U.S. population. The company is actively expanding its portfolio, having made acquisitions of $2.7 billion over the past 18 months, including a recent expansion into the UK home care market, which diversified its asset types and operator base. This demonstrates a strategy to capture a growing market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to growth through acquisitions. The company has a history of sourcing properties at attractive yields and recently completed a landmark acquisition in the UK, adding 134 properties and $69 million in annualized rent. This move, along with a total of $1.17 billion in acquisitions year-to-date in 2025, shows a clear and aggressive strategy to expand its asset base and increase sales potential.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a REIT, "R&D" is best measured by the effectiveness of its investment and capital allocation strategy. CareTrust has a history of sourcing properties at attractive investment yields, averaging 9.1% over the past 10 years. This disciplined and high-yielding acquisition strategy is the direct driver of its growth and profitability, indicating a highly effective process for identifying and closing accretive deals relative to its size.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "sales organization" for a REIT is its acquisitions team. The company's significant and consistent deal flow—$1.5 billion in 2024 and $1.17 billion year-to-date in 2025—demonstrates a highly capable acquisition pipeline. The ability to source and execute deals of this magnitude, including a complex international transaction, suggests an above-average team.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates strong profitability. For Q2 2025, normalized FFO per share grew by 19% year-over-year, and normalized Funds Available for Distribution (FAD) grew by 16% year-over-year. The company reported a net margin of 42.22% in a recent quarter. This level of margin is robust for a real estate investment trust and indicates strong operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CareTrust REIT grows its margins through a combination of accretive acquisitions and organic growth. The company's recent acquisitions have been immediately accretive to FFO. Additionally, organic growth is driven by built-in rent escalators within its lease agreements, which provides a steady, predictable increase in revenue from its existing portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CareTrust REIT is a small organization with only 21 employees reported. No verifiable evidence regarding employee satisfaction, attrition rates, or labor relations is available in the provided sources. Without this data, it is impossible to assess the quality of its personnel relations.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The available sources do not contain information regarding the stability of the management team, board relations, or succession planning. Without evidence on executive turnover or internal harmony, this point cannot be confirmed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the provided sources that details the management team beyond top-level executives or discusses the depth of operational leadership. Key person risk and management bench strength are not addressed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company reports standard financial metrics, there is no specific information available in the search results regarding the quality of its cost analysis, the granularity of its accounting, or the status of its internal controls. Access to the full 10-K filing would be required to evaluate this properly.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes. In the healthcare REIT industry, operator quality and portfolio diversification are critical differentiators. CareTrust's recent UK acquisition diversified its operator base, payer mix, and asset types. Furthermore, the company maintains a very strong balance sheet with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of just 2.0x, far below the industry-safe level of 6x, giving it significant financial flexibility compared to peers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management’s actions, such as undertaking a multi-billion dollar acquisition strategy over the past two years and expanding internationally, point to a clear long-range focus. The company recently raised $736 million in an upsized public stock offering specifically to finance new investments and repay debt, signaling a priority on reinvesting for future growth over short-term EPS optimization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company just completed a large equity offering. However, its financial position is exceptionally strong, with a net debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2.0x and no debt maturities until 2028. This indicates that while management chose to use equity to fund its large acquisition pipeline, it was not forced to and has significant debt capacity available. Therefore, it has the strength to fund growth without being solely reliant on dilutive financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** An assessment of management’s candor requires a review of earnings call transcripts and investor communications over time, especially during challenging periods. The provided sources do not offer this historical context or insight into communication style.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The available search results do not contain any information regarding legal issues, regulatory actions, related-party transactions, or other governance red flags that would call management's integrity into question. However, the absence of negative evidence is not definitive proof of unquestionable integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

---
**Synthesis:**

CareTrust REIT scores well on factors related to its growth strategy, market opportunity, and financial strength. The company is capitalizing on the long-term demographic trend of an aging population through a highly active and apparently effective acquisition program, which now includes international diversification. This strategy is supported by a rock-solid balance sheet with very low leverage, giving management significant flexibility. The primary weaknesses in this analysis stem from a lack of information regarding the qualitative aspects of management, such as executive relations, management depth, and candor with investors. The score would most likely be impacted in the next 12–24 months by the continued success and integration of its large acquisitions, particularly the new UK assets, and any significant shifts in interest rates that could affect its cost of capital and acquisition pace. Flipping the "No" answers to "Yes" would require reviewing earnings call transcripts for candor, proxy statements for executive stability and compensation, and the full 10-K for details on internal controls and risk-factor discussions.

**Fisher Score is 9 / 15**
