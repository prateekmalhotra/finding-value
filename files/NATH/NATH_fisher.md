Nathan's Famous, Inc. (NATH), August 22, 2024, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024, and investor transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous operates in the mature markets of quick-service restaurants (QSR) and packaged foods. While the core hot dog market is not a high-growth category, the company is pursuing growth through its Branded Product Program, which licenses the Nathan's Famous brand for use on a variety of food products sold in supermarkets and club stores. This program has driven revenue growth. Additionally, the company sees opportunities in expanding its virtual "ghost kitchen" brands, such as Wings of New York. The success of these initiatives will determine the potential for a sizable increase in sales.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a commitment to product development and brand extension. The company has expanded beyond its core hot dog offering to include crinkle-cut fries, onion rings, and other food items. A significant initiative is the development of virtual brands like "Wings of New York" and "Arthur Treacher's," which leverage the existing infrastructure of restaurant operators to generate new revenue streams with minimal capital investment. This strategy, along with the expansion of licensed products, indicates a focus on future growth beyond the mature restaurant business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a food and restaurant company, Nathan's Famous does not have a formal R&D expense line item in its financial statements, which is common for the industry. Instead, development occurs through culinary innovation and brand extensions. The launch of virtual brands and the expansion of licensed products suggest some effectiveness in product development. However, without specific metrics or a dedicated R&D budget, it is difficult to assess the efficiency of these efforts relative to the company's size or competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's employs a multi-channel sales strategy that includes company-owned and franchised restaurants, a branded product licensing program, and food service sales. The Branded Product Program, which licenses the brand to major food producers like John Morrell & Co., has been the primary driver of revenue growth, indicating a successful sales and partnership strategy in the retail channel. The continued expansion of its franchise and licensing network suggests an effective sales organization for a company of its size.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024, Nathan's Famous reported a gross profit margin of approximately 30.6% and an operating margin of approximately 24.3%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended June 30, 2024), the gross margin was 31.9% and the operating margin was 26.6%. These margins, particularly the operating margin, are strong for the restaurant and packaged food industry, reflecting the high profitability of the company's licensing-focused business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924025270/nath20240630_10q.htm']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary strategy for maintaining high margins is its focus on the capital-light, high-margin licensing business. This shifts production and distribution costs to partners. Additionally, in its restaurant segment, the company manages costs through supply chain agreements and operational efficiencies. The expansion of virtual brands is another margin-accretive initiative as it adds revenue with minimal incremental fixed costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2024, Nathan's Famous had only 148 employees, the majority of whom work in its five company-owned restaurants. The company states that it considers its employee relations to be good. A small number of employees at its Coney Island location are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. There is no evidence of significant labor disputes or widespread employee dissatisfaction. However, the company provides limited disclosure on metrics like turnover or employee engagement, making a definitive assessment of "outstanding" relations difficult.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Nathan's Famous appears to be stable, with key members having long tenures with the company or in the industry. The 2024 10-K shows a consistent leadership team. However, the company's ownership is highly concentrated, with a single stockholder, an investment fund, controlling a majority of the voting power. This structure can lead to potential conflicts of interest and limits the influence of public shareholders, preventing a conclusion of "outstanding" executive relations from a minority shareholder perspective.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nathan's Famous is a small company with a correspondingly small executive team. The 10-K lists a handful of key executive officers. While these individuals have experience, the company's filings also note that the loss of key personnel, such as its Chairman or CEO, could have a material adverse effect on the business. This indicates a potential key-person risk and a lack of significant management depth beyond the top executives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Grant Thornton LLP, has issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements, indicating they are presented fairly in all material respects. Furthermore, management has concluded that as of March 31, 2024, its internal control over financial reporting was effective. There is no history of significant restatements or material weaknesses, suggesting adequate accounting controls for a company of its size.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The key differentiating factor for Nathan's Famous is its iconic brand, which has been cultivated for over 100 years and is synonymous with the American hot dog. This brand strength allows the company to pursue a highly profitable licensing model, where partners bear the manufacturing and distribution costs in exchange for using the Nathan's name. This capital-light strategy is a significant competitive advantage compared to traditional restaurant operators and food manufacturers. The annual Fourth of July Hot Dog Eating Contest is a major, unique marketing event that reinforces this brand leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy of focusing on franchising and licensing indicates a long-range outlook. This approach builds a durable, royalty-based revenue stream that requires sustained brand investment rather than short-term, capital-intensive restaurant openings. The development of virtual brands also represents an investment in future growth trends. However, the company also engages in practices like paying significant dividends, which could suggest a focus on returning capital to shareholders rather than aggressive reinvestment for growth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong financial position with a business model that generates consistent cash flow. Its capital-light licensing and franchising strategy does not require significant capital expenditures for growth. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases rather than issuing new shares. Given its profitability, cash flow, and low capital intensity, there is minimal risk of shareholder dilution from equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924025270/nath20240630_10q.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a smaller company, Nathan's Famous does not regularly hold public earnings conference calls with analysts, limiting the opportunities to assess management's candor in a live Q&A setting. While its SEC filings provide the required disclosures, they do not offer the same level of voluntary, in-depth discussion of challenges and strategic shifts that would be expected from a company with "outstanding" investor communications. The lack of transcripts for earnings calls is a key indicator of limited communication.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/NATH/transcripts/']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal or regulatory actions disclosed in the company's filings that would suggest a lack of integrity. However, the company's 10-K does disclose related party transactions, primarily involving its majority stockholder. While these are disclosed as required and may not be improper, their existence prevents a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity, as such dealings can present potential conflicts of interest between management, the controlling shareholder, and public shareholders.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/69733/000143774924019916/nath20240331_10k.htm']

---
**Synthesis:**

Nathan's Famous, Inc. scores positively on its strong brand, effective multi-channel sales organization, and worthwhile profit margins, all of which are driven by its capital-light and highly profitable licensing business model. The company's financial position is solid, with minimal risk of equity dilution. However, the analysis reveals weaknesses in areas Fisher considered crucial for long-term, uncommon growth. The company operates in a mature market, and its small size leads to concerns about management depth and key-person risk. Furthermore, its corporate governance structure, with a controlling majority shareholder and related-party transactions, combined with limited investor communication, raises flags regarding executive relations and integrity from a minority shareholder's viewpoint. The score is unlikely to change significantly in the next 12-24 months without a fundamental shift in its growth trajectory or corporate governance. A "No" would flip to a "Yes" for "Long Runway" if the company demonstrated significant, sustained growth in its virtual kitchen brands or new product categories. Similarly, improved investor communication through regular earnings calls could change the score for "Candor with Investors."

**fisher score is 7 / 15**
