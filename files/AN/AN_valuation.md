### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**
A review of publicly available earnings call transcript archives did not yield specific, quantifiable forward-looking guidance for revenue, margins, or capital expenditures. Therefore, the following forecast is based on historical performance and stated assumptions.

---

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**
The following assumptions will be used to build the 5-year forecast.

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Source / Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **2.5% annually.** This reflects a conservative growth rate, slightly below the most recent TTM growth of 3.15% and accounts for the cyclical nature of the auto industry and recent flat performance. | Inferred from historical data on StockAnalysis.com |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin** | **5.1% of Revenue.** Held flat at the current TTM level, which is below the 3-year average. This assumes recent margin compression persists due to market normalization. | StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **25.0%.** This is a normalized rate based on the average effective tax rate over the last three years (approx. 25.25%). | Inferred from historical data on StockAnalysis.com |
| **Capital Expenditures** | **1.2% of Revenue.** Based on the 3-year historical average, reflecting ongoing investment needs. | Inferred from historical data on StockAnalysis.com |
| **Change in Working Capital** | **5.0% of incremental revenue.** The TTM figure is volatile. This assumption normalizes working capital needs as a function of growth. | Analyst Assumption |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.15% of Revenue.** Held constant based on the TTM percentage (40.4M / 27,464.1M). | Inferred from historical data |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD, millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $28,150.7 | $28,854.5 | $29,575.8 | $30,315.2 | $31,073.1 |
| **EBIT (5.1%)** | $1,435.7 | $1,471.6 | $1,508.4 | $1,546.1 | $1,584.7 |
| NOPAT (EBIT \* 0.75) | $1,076.8 | $1,103.7 | $1,131.3 | $1,159.6 | $1,188.6 |
| **(+) D&A (0.9% of Rev)** | $253.4 | $259.7 | $266.2 | $272.8 | $279.7 |
| **(-) SBC (0.15% of Rev)** | $42.2 | $43.3 | $44.4 | $45.5 | $46.6 |
| **(-) Capex (1.2% of Rev)** | $337.8 | $346.3 | $354.9 | $363.8 | $372.9 |
| **(-) Change in WC** | $34.3 | $35.2 | $36.1 | $37.0 | $37.9 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.30%** (Source: YCharts, U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield as of Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Beta (5-Year):** **0.89**. This reflects slightly lower volatility than the overall market, which is reasonable for a large, established auto retailer. (Source: MarketBeat)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.0%** (Standard market assumption)
    *   **Calculation:** `4.30% + 0.89 * 5.0% = 8.75%`

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** `(Interest Expense / Total Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate)`
    *   **Calculation:** `($384.2M / $9,304.6M) * (1 - 0.25) = 3.10%`

*   **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):**
    *   **Formula:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt`
    *   **Market Cap (E):** $8,300 million (approx. $209.60 share price * 39.6M shares)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $9,305 million
    *   **Calculation:** `($8,300 / $17,605) * 8.75% + ($9,305 / $17,605) * 3.10% = 4.12% + 1.64% = 5.76%`
    *   **WACC Used:** **5.8%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This is a conservative rate, in line with long-term inflation expectations and sustainable growth for a mature company.
    *   **Calculation:** `($1,011.0M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.058 - 0.025) = $1,036.3M / 0.033 = $31,403M`

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **EBITDA Year 5:** EBIT Y5 + D&A Y5 = $1,584.7M + $279.7M = $1,864.4M
    *   **Median EV/EBITDA Multiple:** **7.1x** (Source: Finbox, 5-year median)
    *   **Calculation:** `$1,864.4M * 7.1 = $13,235M`
    *   **Conclusion:** There is a significant discrepancy. The Exit Multiple method results in a much lower and more conservative terminal value. **The lower value of $13,235M is used for the valuation.**

| (USD, millions) | FCFF / Terminal Value | PV Factor (5.8%) | Present Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Year 1 | $915.8 | 0.9452 | $865.6 |
| Year 2 | $938.6 | 0.8934 | $838.6 |

| Terminal Value | $13,235.0 | 0.7543 | $9,983.4 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | | | **$13,049.7** |

*   **Equity Value Calculation:**
    *   **Enterprise Value:** $13,049.7 million
    *   **(-) Total Debt:** $9,304.6 million (Source: StockAnalysis.com)
    *   **(+) Cash & Equivalents:** $62.9 million (Source: StockAnalysis.com)
    *   **Equity Value:** `$13,049.7M - $9,304.6M + $62.9M = $3,808.0M`

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   **Calculation:** `$3,808.0M / 39.6M shares = $96.16`

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$96 per share.** This assumes moderate growth and sustained recent margin levels.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$65 per share.** This scenario assumes no revenue growth and further EBIT margin compression to 4.0%, with a lower exit multiple of 6.0x.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$130 per share.** This scenario assumes a return to higher growth (4.0%) and margin expansion to 6.0% as the market strengthens, with a higher exit multiple of 8.0x.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A **30%** margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate to account for forecast uncertainty and risks.
    *   **MOS Price:** `$96.16 * (1 - 0.30) = $67.31`

### **One-paragraph Risk Notes**
Key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** A recession could significantly reduce consumer demand for new and used vehicles, impacting revenue and profitability. 2) **Margin Pressure:** Increased competition, higher inventory levels, and a normalization of used car prices could continue to compress gross and operating margins from the elevated levels seen in recent years. 3) **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Higher interest rates increase floor plan financing costs for the company and raise borrowing costs for consumers, potentially dampening vehicle sales. 4) **EV Transition:** A rapid shift to electric vehicles could disrupt traditional dealership service and parts revenue streams, which are a significant source of high-margin profit.

final answer is 96 $
