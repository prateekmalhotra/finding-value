### B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION

Key guidance extracted from the company's Q2 2025 earnings release:

*   **Full Year 2025 Revenue:** "We are updating our full year revenue outlook to $1,975 - 2,000 million, up 12-14% y/y..." (GlobeNewswire, Aug 6, 2025).
*   **Full Year 2025 Free Cash Flow:** "...we now expect to generate free cash flow of $595 - $610 million in 2025, or 30-31% of revenue." (GlobeNewswire, Aug 6, 2025).

### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

*   **Revenue Forecast:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** A growth rate of **13.0%** is used, based on the midpoint of management's 12-14% guidance.
    *   **Years 2-5:** The growth rate will decelerate by 1.5% annually, assuming a gradual maturation of the business. This results in growth rates of 11.5%, 10.0%, 8.5%, and 7.0%.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin (EBIT):** The TTM operating margin is 7.7% ($143.7M / $1,869M). The forecast will start at this level and expand by 50 bps per year, reflecting management's focus on profitability and operating leverage mentioned in earnings calls.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   The effective tax rate over the last 3 years has been volatile. We will use a normalized statutory tax rate of **21%** for the forecast period, a standard assumption for U.S.-based companies.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex was 0.4% of revenue. The 3-year historical average is higher. We will assume capex at **1.0% of revenue**, a conservative estimate.
    *   **Working Capital:** TTM Change in Working Capital was 12.0% of revenue. We will model this as **5.0% of *incremental* revenue**, assuming more efficient management as the company scales.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** TTM SBC was 13.0% of revenue. This will be modeled to decrease by 100 bps annually, from 12.0% to 8.0% of revenue over the forecast period, as the company matures.
    *   **Share Count:** The latest diluted share count of **61.0 million** will be used for the final per-share calculation.

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers. The formula used is:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (in Millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,112.0 | $2,354.9 | $2,590.4 | $2,810.5 | $3,007.2 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *13.0%* | *11.5%* | *10.0%* | *8.5%* | *7.0%* |
| **EBIT** | **$173.2** | **$200.2** | **$226.7** | **$251.5** | **$278.2** |
| *EBIT Margin* | *8.2%* | *8.5%* | *8.8%* | *8.9%* | *9.2%* |
| EBIT * (1-Tax Rate) | $136.8 | $158.1 | $179.1 | $198.7 | $219.7 |
| + D&A (1.6% of Rev) | $33.8 | $37.7 | $41.4 | $45.0 | $48.1 |
| - SBC | ($253.4) | ($259.0) | ($259.0) | ($252.9) | ($240.6) |
| - Capex (1.0% of Rev) | ($21.1) | ($23.5) | ($25.9) | ($28.1) | ($30.1) |
| - Chg. in WC | ($12.2) | ($12.1) | ($11.8) | ($11.0) | ($9.8) |
| **FCFF** | **($116.1)** | **($98.8)** | **($76.2)** | **($58.3)** | **($12.7)** |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.29%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.5%**. A standard premium for a developed market.
    *   **Beta:** **1.27** (5-Year Monthly). This reflects a higher volatility than the market average, which is reasonable for a tech-growth stock. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 1.27 * 5.5% = 11.28%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt:** Interest Expense / Total Debt = $35.7M / $1,000M = **3.57%**.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 3.57% * (1 - 21%) = 2.82%**

*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Cap (Equity): $7,060M (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025).
    *   Market Value of Debt: $1,000M
    *   **WACC = (7060 / 8060) * 11.28% + (1000 / 8060) * 2.82% = 10.22%**

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate `g` of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   Terminal Value = (-$12.7 * 1.025) / (10.22% - 2.5%) = **-$168.4M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   The Gordon Growth method results in a negative terminal value, which is not realistic. This is due to the high levels of stock-based compensation weighing on the FCFF calculation. As a cross-check, and primary method in this case, we will use an Exit Multiple on Year 5 EBITDA.
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $278.2M + $48.1M = $326.3M**
    *   The current EV/EBITDA multiple is 39.06 (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025), which is high. A more conservative historical median for a SaaS company would be in the 15-20x range. We will use an exit multiple of **18.0x**.
    *   **Terminal Value = $326.3M * 18.0 = $5,873.4M**
    *   Given the discrepancy, the Exit Multiple method is more realistic and will be used.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

*   PV of Explicit Period FCFF = (-116.1/1.1022) + (-98.8/1.1022^2) + (-76.2/1.1022^3) + (-58.3/1.1022^4) + (-12.7/1.1022^5) = **-$329.8M**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $5,873.4M / (1.1022^5) = **$3,607.7M**
*   **Enterprise Value = $3,607.7M - $329.8M = $3,277.9M**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
*   Equity Value = $3,277.9M - ($1,000.0M - $693.0M) = **$2,970.9M**

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares**
*   Base-Case Fair Value = $2,970.9M / 61.0M = **$48.70**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$48.70**. Assumes 13% revenue growth decelerating to 7%, with modest margin expansion.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$32.00**. Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 10% decelerating to 5%) and stable margins, with a lower 15x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$75.00**. Assumes higher revenue growth sustained above 12%, faster margin expansion, and a 20x exit multiple.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A **30%** margin of safety is applied to the base case.
    *   **MOS Price = $48.70 * (1 - 0.30) = $34.09**

### Risk Notes

1.  **High Stock-Based Compensation:** SBC is a significant expense, representing over 13% of TTM revenue. While it is a non-cash charge, it creates shareholder dilution and is a material economic cost that heavily impacts FCFF.
2.  **Competition:** The website building and e-commerce space is highly competitive, with numerous players from large platforms like Shopify to smaller niche builders. This could pressure pricing and growth.
3.  **Market Sentiment:** As a high-beta growth stock, Wix is sensitive to changes in market sentiment and interest rates. A shift away from growth investing could negatively impact its valuation multiple.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation relies on continued revenue growth and margin expansion. Any stumbles in execution, such as the integration of acquisitions or failure to innovate with AI, could lead to lower-than-expected results.

final answer is 48.70 $
