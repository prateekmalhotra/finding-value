### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Trip.com Group is capitalizing on the robust recovery of travel in China and expanding its global presence. In Q1 2025, revenues grew 29% year-over-year, driven by strong demand in accommodation and air travel. Management highlights the long-term potential of outbound travel, which has yet to fully recover to pre-pandemic levels, and its growing Trip.com brand in APAC and EMEA markets as key multi-year growth drivers. The company's strategy is focused on leveraging its technological advantages to gain market share in the expanding global travel market.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes technology and AI as core to its strategy. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Jane Sun highlighted the role of their AI assistant, TripGen, in improving booking efficiency and user experience. The company's 2024 annual report details ongoing investments in AI-driven features, content strategy, and platform enhancements to increase user engagement and capture a larger share of travel-related spending beyond simple bookings.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For Q1 2025, product development expenses were RMB 3.1 billion, a 16% increase year-over-year, representing approximately 25% of revenue. This level of investment is significant. The output is tangible through AI initiatives like TripGen, which handled a growing volume of user requests, and platform optimizations that have supported a 15% increase in air ticket bookings and a 21% rise in accommodation reservations year-over-year. This demonstrates a direct link between R&D spending and core business growth.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s "sales" function is primarily digital marketing and brand building. Sales and marketing expenses for Q1 2025 were RMB 2.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year, reflecting investments to capture growth opportunities. The effectiveness is shown by strong top-line growth, with total Q1 2025 net revenue up 29% year-over-year to RMB 11.9 billion.

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For Q1 2025, Trip.com Group reported a gross margin of 85%, consistent with the prior year.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on leveraging technology to enhance operating efficiency. In their Q1 2025 earnings call, executives noted that investments in AI and automation are improving customer service productivity and personalizing marketing, which helps manage costs. This operational leverage is key to their strategy, allowing them to grow revenue faster than their fixed and semi-variable cost base, thereby supporting or improving margins over the long term.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is insufficient verifiable, recent information in primary source documents like SEC filings or earnings calls to make a definitive judgment. The company's 20-F mentions standard employee benefits and equity incentive plans but offers no specific metrics on attrition, engagement, or labor relations. Without credible third-party or company-disclosed data, this point cannot be confirmed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior management team at Trip.com Group has demonstrated significant stability and a long track record. Co-founder and Executive Chairman James Liang, along with CEO Jane Sun (who joined in 2005 and became CEO in 2016), have guided the company for over a decade. This long tenure among key executives suggests a stable and cohesive leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Trip.com Group 2024 Form 20-F (April 11, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's annual report and investor materials name a broad team of executives beyond the Chairman and CEO, including heads of key business units like accommodation, transportation, and packaged tours, as well as functional heads for technology and finance. This structure suggests a deep bench of leadership with clear operational responsibilities, mitigating key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Trip.com Group 2024 Form 20-F (April 11, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Trip.com Group provides clear, segmented revenue reporting for its primary business lines (accommodation, transportation, etc.). Its 2024 annual report contains an unqualified audit opinion from PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP. The report also states that management has concluded the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. There is no recent history of material restatements.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the online travel agency (OTA) industry is scale, which creates a powerful network effect: more users attract more suppliers (hotels, airlines), which in turn provides more choice and better prices for users. Trip.com's dominant position in China and its expanding global inventory through brands like Skyscanner give it a significant data and network advantage over smaller competitors. Their comprehensive "one-stop shop" platform creates high user stickiness.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Trip.com Group 2024 Form 20-F (April 11, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary consistently prioritizes long-term market share gains and technological leadership over short-term profit maximization. For example, the sustained, heavy investment in product development (25% of Q1 2025 revenue) and international expansion, even at the cost of near-term margin pressure, demonstrates a long-range focus. CEO Jane Sun emphasized their goal is to "build a solid foundation for sustainable growth in the future."
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Trip.com Group had a strong balance sheet with cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaling RMB 82.5 billion (approximately USD 11.4 billion). The company generates positive free cash flow and has an active share repurchase program, having repurchased approximately USD 426 million of its shares in Q1 2025. This strong liquidity and capital return policy indicate a very low risk of dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed commentary during earnings calls and addresses analyst questions directly. In the Q1 2025 call, executives openly discussed the pacing of the international travel recovery and competitive dynamics in various markets. This level of detail and willingness to discuss both opportunities and challenges suggests a high degree of candor with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 20-F filing does not list any material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance issues that would call management's integrity into question. The company has been publicly listed on the Nasdaq since 2003 and has maintained a clean record with regulators. While operating in a complex regulatory environment in China, there are no current red flags indicating a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**

Trip.com Group scores highly on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its strong market position, solid financials, and clear long-term strategy. The company's primary strengths are its dominant market share in the recovering Chinese travel market, its robust profit margins, and a stable, long-tenured management team that is prudently investing in technology and international expansion. The balance sheet is exceptionally strong, mitigating any financing risks. The primary negative is the lack of verifiable data on personnel relations, a common issue for companies that do not voluntarily disclose such metrics. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the pace and sustainability of China's outbound travel recovery, and the success of its AI-driven product initiatives in fending off competition and improving operating leverage. A "No" on labor relations could flip to "Yes" with enhanced disclosure of metrics like employee turnover and satisfaction survey results in its annual ESG report.

**Fisher score is 14 / 15**
