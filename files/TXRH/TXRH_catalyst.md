### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Accelerated Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a significant share repurchase program in place, with $479.8 million remaining under the current authorization as of April 1, 2025. Accelerated execution of this program would reduce the number of outstanding shares and increase earnings per share.
*   **Mechanism:** A lower share count increases earnings per share (EPS), which, with a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Repurchase of $100 million in shares at an average price of $180/share, reducing share count by approximately 0.56 million shares.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Repurchase of $250 million in shares at an average price of $180/share, reducing share count by approximately 1.39 million shares.
    *   **High Scenario:** Repurchase of $400 million in shares at an average price of $180/share, reducing share count by approximately 2.22 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (+2-5%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has a history of executing on its repurchase authorizations and has a strong cash position.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Favorable market conditions and continued strong cash flow generation.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in the business could lead the company to preserve cash and slow down repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases in upcoming quarterly reports.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Continued Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Texas Roadhouse has demonstrated strong comparable restaurant sales growth, with a 5.8% increase in Q2 2025, driven by a 4% increase in traffic. Continued momentum in this area will drive revenue and profitability growth.
*   **Mechanism:** Higher same-store sales lead to increased revenue and improved operating leverage, resulting in higher net income and EPS.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 3% comparable sales growth.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 5% comparable sales growth.
    *   **High Scenario:** 7% comparable sales growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+5-15%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has a strong track record of positive comparable sales growth, but the macroeconomic environment could impact consumer spending.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued consumer demand and effective marketing and operational execution.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on comparable restaurant sales and traffic in Form 10-Q filings and earnings calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A recession or significant inflation could reduce consumer discretionary spending and negatively impact traffic and sales.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The company's strong brand and value proposition position it well to continue to drive traffic and sales.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is accelerating the expansion of its Bubba's 33 concept, with the potential for double-digit new restaurant openings next year. This provides a second growth engine for the company beyond the core Texas Roadhouse brand.
*   **Mechanism:** New restaurant openings contribute to revenue growth and, as the concept matures, should contribute to net income and EPS growth.
*   **Timing:** 2026-2030
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 5 new Bubba's 33 restaurants per year.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 10 new Bubba's 33 restaurants per year.
    *   **High Scenario:** 15 new Bubba's 33 restaurants per year.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+10-20%)

*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful new restaurant openings and positive reception of the concept in new markets.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on new restaurant openings by brand.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** The Bubba's 33 concept may not be as successful as Texas Roadhouse in all markets, and a failed expansion could be costly.
