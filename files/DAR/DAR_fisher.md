Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K filed February 25, 2025; Form 10-Q filed August 6, 2025; Form DEF 14A filed March 20, 2025; Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript dated July 24, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Darling Ingredients operates in three segments: Feed, Food, and Fuel ingredients, all of which are positioned for growth driven by global trends in sustainability and food production. The Fuel Ingredients segment, particularly through its Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) joint venture, has significant growth potential from the increasing demand for renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). In November 2024, DGD completed a project to produce ~240 million gallons of SAF annually. The Food Ingredients segment, a global leader in collagen, is expanding to meet rising demand in health and wellness markets. The core Feed Ingredients segment benefits from the global need for sustainable animal feed and pet food ingredients.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively investing in growth projects across its segments. The company expects capital expenditures of approximately $400 million in fiscal year 2025 for compliance, replacement, and expansion projects. Key investments include the successful startup of one of the world's largest SAF units at the DGD facility and the integration of strategic acquisitions like Gelnex (collagen) and Valley Proteins (rendering) to expand capacity and geographic reach. The company also recently introduced a new collagen peptide product targeting post-meal glucose spikes.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Darling Ingredients does not disclose specific R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, its innovation is evident through new product launches and process improvements. For example, the company commercialized a new collagen peptide and operates an insect protein business (EnviroFlight) that develops specialty proteins from black soldier fly larvae. The DGD joint venture utilizes an advanced hydroprocessing technology licensed from UOP LLC, indicating a focus on leveraging effective R&D. The lack of quantified R&D spending prevents a definitive "Yes".
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Darling operates a global sales network with trading departments in Texas, Kentucky, Virginia, and the Netherlands, along with various offices across Europe, Asia, and South America, selling products to over 85 countries. The company's ability to coordinate international sales of common products and market into the highest-return regions suggests an effective and sophisticated sales structure. In fiscal 2024, the top ten customers accounted for approximately 36% of product sales, indicating significant relationships with major clients. However, without specific metrics like customer retention or win rates, it's difficult to definitively conclude the sales organization is "above-average."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, Darling Ingredients reported a consolidated gross margin of 22.4%. The gross margin for its segments were 21.5% for Feed Ingredients, 25.1% for Food Ingredients, and 20.8% for Fuel Ingredients. These margins are subject to volatility from commodity prices. While margins have compressed from 24.2% in fiscal 2023 due to lower finished product prices, they remain substantial for a business processing agricultural co-products. The company's ability to maintain double-digit gross margins across its segments in a challenging commodity environment indicates worthwhile profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Darling employs several strategies to protect and improve margins. A majority of its U.S. raw material supply is acquired on a "formula basis," linking raw material costs to finished product prices, which helps stabilize gross margins against commodity price volatility. The company focuses on producing premium, value-added products like specialized pet food ingredients and Peptan collagen, which command higher prices than standard commodities. Management also emphasizes cost control and operational excellence, as noted in their 2025 Proxy Statement. Strategic acquisitions are also used to enhance efficiencies and integrate operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm), [https://ir.darlingingredients.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-071705/0001193125-25-071705.pdf (March 20, 2025)](https://ir.darlingingredients.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-071705/0001193125-25-071705.pdf)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 28, 2024, Darling employed approximately 15,500 people full-time. Approximately 16% of North American and 64% of international employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The company states that management believes its relations with employees and their representatives are satisfactory. It has implemented several leadership training programs, such as the Darling Leadership Academy, and offers educational assistance. Without external data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or safety metrics beyond company statements, it is difficult to verify that relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability, with several key leaders having long tenures. Randall C. Stuewe has served as Chairman and CEO since 2003, indicating consistent leadership. The proxy statement outlines executive compensation tied to performance, including metrics like adjusted EBITDA, aiming to align management interests with shareholders. There is no public evidence of significant disputes or turnover at the senior executive or board level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://ir.darlingingredients.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-071705/0001193125-25-071705.pdf (March 20, 2025)](https://ir.darlingingredients.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-071705/0001193125-25-071705.pdf)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses a team of executive officers beyond the CEO, including leaders for its major segments and functions like finance, legal, and strategy. For example, Brad Phillips is EVP, Chief Financial Officer, and John Bullock is EVP, Chief Strategy Officer. The global nature of the business, with operations on five continents managed through subsidiaries like Darling Ingredients International, suggests a decentralized structure with operational leaders at regional and business unit levels. This structure indicates a depth of management capable of running a complex, global organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm), [https://ir.darlingingredients.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-071705/0001193125-25-071705.pdf (March 20, 2025)](https://ir.darlingingredients.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-25-071705/0001193125-25-071705.pdf)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed segment reporting for its Feed, Food, and Fuel businesses, including net sales, gross margin, and operating income, indicating a granular level of cost analysis. The independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024. There is no recent history of material weaknesses or financial restatements mentioned in the primary filings reviewed. This evidence points to solid accounting controls and cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Darling's key competitive advantage is its massive global scale in sourcing and processing animal by-products and used cooking oil. Operating over 260 facilities in more than 15 countries, it processes about 15% of the world's animal agricultural by-products. This scale creates a significant barrier to entry and allows for logistical efficiencies that smaller competitors cannot match. The vertical integration from collection of raw materials to the production of high-value renewable fuels (DGD) and specialty ingredients (collagen) is a crucial differentiator that provides control over feedstock and captures value across the entire chain.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes long-term strategic investments, even when facing short-term market volatility. The significant capital allocated to the DGD SAF project and recent large-scale acquisitions (Valley Proteins, FASA, Gelnex) demonstrate a focus on building durable growth platforms for the future. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, despite disappointing results due to market headwinds, management provided full-year guidance and expressed expectations for stronger performance in 2025 and 2026, contingent on market conditions, underscoring a long-range view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm), [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-darling-ingredients-misses-q2-2025-forecasts-93CH-3522294 (July 24, 2025)](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-darling-ingredients-misses-q2-2025-forecasts-93CH-3522294)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 28, 2024, the company had working capital of $395.9 million and $1.16 billion available under its revolving credit facility. The company generated $839.3 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2024 and intends to finance its planned $400 million in 2025 capital expenditures with cash flow from operations. The company has a share repurchase program, buying back $34.3 million in shares in fiscal 2024, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital rather than diluting shareholders. This financial strength and cash generation capability suggest a low risk of dilutive equity financing for foreseeable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm (February 25, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916540/000091654025000008/dar-20241228.htm)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management holds quarterly conference calls to discuss financial results. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, following results that missed analyst expectations, management openly discussed the challenges, including a weak RIN market and underperformance in protein markets. They provided specific reasons for the miss and outlined their go-forward strategy and guidance, demonstrating transparency during a difficult quarter. This willingness to address headwinds directly suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's 10-K and proxy statement reveals no material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of management. The company is subject to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business, but it states that it believes the likelihood is remote that any additional liability would have a material effect. The board has independent committees for Audit, Compensation, and Nominating & Corporate Governance, which is a standard governance practice. Recent insider trading activity shows sales by executives, which can be for various personal financial planning reasons and are not necessarily indicative of a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Darling Ingredients scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strong long-term growth potential, a commitment to reinvestment, and a solid financial position. The company's strengths lie in its global scale, vertical integration, and strategic positioning in growing markets for renewable fuels and specialty food ingredients. Management appears stable, deep, and aligned with shareholder interests. The primary areas of weakness in this analysis are points where strong, verifiable evidence is lacking, specifically on the quantitative effectiveness of R&D and the sales organization, leading to conservative "No" answers. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the performance of the renewable fuels market (prices for Renewable Identification Numbers and Low Carbon Fuel Standard credits) and the successful integration and margin contribution of its recent large acquisitions. A sustained improvement in margins and profitability at the DGD joint venture would be the most powerful catalyst, while any disclosure of specific R&D metrics could flip that point to a "Yes".

fisher score is 12 / 15
