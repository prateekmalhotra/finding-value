### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

*   "We remain focused on driving 7% to 8% organic revenue growth while adding 3% to 4% of inorganic revenue growth for 2025." (Rollins, Inc. Q2 2025 Earnings Call, July 24, 2025)

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:** A 5-year revenue CAGR of 8.0% is projected. This is based on the midpoint of management's organic growth guidance (7.5%) and a conservative estimate of acquisition-driven growth (0.5%), which is lower than the guided 3-4% to reflect the uncertainty of future M&A.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 18.2%. The 3-year average operating margin is approximately 19.5%. We will assume a stable operating margin of 19.0% throughout the forecast period, slightly below the historical average to be conservative.
*   **Tax Rate:** The effective tax rate for the six months ended June 30, 2025, was 25.0%. The 3-year average tax rate is approximately 25.5%. A tax rate of 25.5% is assumed.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Capex as a percentage of revenue has averaged approximately 0.8% over the last 3 years. We will assume capex at 1.0% of revenue going forward.
*   **Working Capital:** The change in working capital will be modeled as 1.0% of the change in revenue, in line with historical averages.
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** SBC is projected to be 1.0% of revenue, consistent with the historical average.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 3,857 | 4,165 | 4,498 | 4,858 | 5,247 |
| EBIT | 733 | 791 | 855 | 923 | 997 |
| EBIT (1-t) | 546 | 589 | 637 | 688 | 743 |
| D&A | 129 | 139 | 150 | 162 | 175 |
| SBC | -39 | -42 | -45 | -49 | -52 |
| Capex | -39 | -42 | -45 | -49 | -52 |
| Change in WC | -3 | -3 | -3 | -4 | -4 |
| **FCFF** | **594** | **641** | **694** | **750** | **810** |

We use FCFF for valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of August 20, 2025, MarketWatch).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (a standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 0.80 (5-year monthly beta from Yahoo Finance). This beta reflects the company's relatively stable, non-cyclical business model.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 0.80 * 5.0% = 8.25%**
*   **Cost of Debt:** 2.1% (Interest Expense / Average Debt).
*   **WACC:**
    *   Equity Weight = 85%, Debt Weight = 15%
    *   **WACC = (0.85 * 8.25%) + (0.15 * 2.1% * (1 - 0.255)) = 7.25%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (in line with long-run inflation expectations).
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (810 * 1.025) / (0.0725 - 0.025) = 17,468**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = 1,172
    *   Median EV/EBITDA Multiple (5-year): 20x
    *   **Terminal Value = 1,172 * 20 = 23,440**

The Gordon Growth method results in a lower, more conservative terminal value, which will be used in the valuation.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit Period FCFF = 2,905
    *   PV of Terminal Value = 12,289
    *   **Enterprise Value = 2,905 + 12,289 = 15,194**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Enterprise Value = 15,194
    *   Less: Net Debt (Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents) = 844 (StockAnalysis.com)
    *   **Equity Value = 14,350**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding = 14,350 / 484.7 = **$29.61**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Lower revenue growth (6%), margin compression (18%), higher WACC (8.25%). **Resulting Value: $22.50**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Higher revenue growth (10%), margin expansion (20%), lower WACC (6.25%). **Resulting Value: $40.00**
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   25% below Base-Case = **$22.21**
    *   30% below Base-Case = **$20.73**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The pest control industry is highly competitive, which could pressure pricing and margins.
2.  **Acquisition Integration:** Rollins' growth strategy relies on acquisitions, and there is a risk of overpaying or failing to successfully integrate acquired businesses.
3.  **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in environmental regulations regarding pesticides could increase compliance costs.
4.  **Economic Sensitivity:** While relatively resilient, a severe economic downturn could lead to reduced demand for pest control services.
5.  **Weather Patterns:** Unpredictable weather can impact pest activity and, consequently, revenue.
