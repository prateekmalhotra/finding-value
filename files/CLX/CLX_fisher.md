Company: The Clorox Company (CLX)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024; Form 10-Q for quarterly period ended March 31, 2025; Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript dated November 1, 2023.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox operates in mature, competitive markets, with 84% of its fiscal year 2024 net sales from the U.S.. Growth is therefore dependent on innovation and market share gains rather than untapped market expansion. The company's "IGNITE" strategy is focused on driving growth through innovation and evolving the product portfolio. While a large percentage of its brands (about 80%) already hold #1 or #2 market share positions, this also indicates strong, consistent demand for its essential consumer staples, providing a stable base for incremental growth through new product launches and adjacent categories.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is heavily invested in ongoing development. The company's IGNITE strategy is the centerpiece of this commitment, designed to accelerate innovation. In fiscal 2024, Clorox launched numerous new products, including new Hidden Valley Ranch flavors and a new lineup of Pine-Sol cleaners. Furthermore, the company is undertaking a significant five-year investment of $560 to $580 million in transformative technologies, including a new ERP system, to generate long-term efficiencies and transform operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Clorox's R&D spending was approximately 1.7% of net sales. This is comparable to peers like Kimberly-Clark (1.7%) and Colgate-Palmolive (1.8%), but lower than industry giant Procter & Gamble (~2.4%). While Clorox consistently launches product innovations, its R&D spending level does not suggest a significant competitive advantage or superior effectiveness relative to its size and direct competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm' (filed May 5, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHOHA_r5jI-ouRIygqd2CEOPdrUqHMcx96WI9A0JK5X9qEtMMnnaSUqUg9Wz8C_fuErYt66HhPoRgdkxtTqEt5xuMoJCU0v98xO7aeuT1AR21C4-kOBZWeuLCti93wVVSiwoxdBnlaiBEM3B5kR (Archived search result)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox has a robust sales and distribution network, selling through mass retailers, grocery outlets, e-commerce channels, and a direct sales force. The company's strong relationships with key customers are evidenced by the fact its five largest customers account for nearly half of consolidated net sales, with Walmart alone representing 25%. This concentration, while a risk, demonstrates the sales organization's ability to manage and maintain large, critical accounts. The company's successful recovery of distribution and service levels following the 2023 cyberattack further underscores the resilience of its sales and logistics operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the quarter ended March 31, 2025, Clorox reported a gross margin of 44.6%. This compares favorably to Kimberly-Clark (~36%) but is below higher-margin peers like Procter & Gamble (~51%) and Colgate-Palmolive (~60%). While not best-in-class, Clorox's margin is substantial and demonstrates strong pricing power and cost management in a competitive consumer goods landscape. The company has successfully rebuilt its margin following recent inflationary pressures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm' (filed May 5, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEwUjBfKh9h5b-gxwBxa0eXAbcmSbqyI2n8HQhDiryYdbsu89_ClW3DshIQUSRO2jg-zSqN0UstYKvDnxgBrGmqKGZSyYVs4pVI0kYBGitmV83GdJBTVGW77IkfahQ1hfWyxJ3r--ABachicdRJqTgCzCcbtwyXluctGHMI-nUzBsFs1-GoftFPDhcT9qWWpljezg5oD-Rt-uyJdOgyfJPpiTyovpOnwQRyAB7B3RjuaLNx_g5OxQwT9zkWSv406wZlY42xE4nMTXjVJ7U54reXa94GlHaChq-arxkYY3P1mT8cmtkTcohtzY_y9h4UJx6yTK8iGUPGwvQ28T1n0BN2IEuQP1E0VUptKmiAnbN8sLoFetEyCs9iPLyPywR_Yp-oZ4BV5pCyZf6r1ko62RFd0APcP7bwifNEOM_keoKHqYodW740YnpwIxn5HBMQk96ts-Odr9OgDy8a1sTmH_8AZ07AbOv2qnnhi_PHNla4n_UXkmwkKkyZy3Q85_NMiP6hiDIGofOTPHy0AQ8WrrP8R-6cQMW9UsidfCHdS9B-A7OoiRzbN18BT1EMiVNi (Archived search result)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG76yowcPcMflcs3GKWeRAN3IVxnpPzILfnLz8RNd6M6N-QARnHO095HPwQRndQoPU92ZD0Tj5xKzzHW3Mv0m7AQ9WLCkLZbsLMNQPnFKWfaRoLJOtas0ENokSMNWvYbVN-0ozcqGBQMmXY (Archived search result)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox is actively focused on margin improvement through a combination of pricing actions, a well-established cost-savings program, and productivity enhancements. The MD&A section of its recent filings explicitly states that gross margin was rebuilt "primarily due to the benefit of pricing actions and continued positive returns from its trademark cost savings program". The company also expects its new streamlined operating model to achieve annual cost savings of approximately $100 million. Divesting its lower-margin Argentina and VMS businesses also structurally improves the corporate margin profile.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm' (filed May 5, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K details a strong focus on human capital. In fiscal year 2024, 82% of employees reported feeling engaged at Clorox, a figure above the 50th percentile for Fortune 500 benchmarks. Workplace safety metrics are also strong, with a Reportable Incident Rate (RIR) of 0.47, significantly below the industry average of 3.2. A search for labor issues found a single retaliation lawsuit filed by a former HR manager, which has been settled. This appears to be an isolated case and does not outweigh the positive reported metrics on engagement and safety.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEBM5h7EZ9t2f0IxAsOcel7S7-2I-DRMUrYoOiosYIPYbEuO9oB0H_Xb6GP00_K-qonpIMClcFArExPj35HoMkbaunJet1TJrhAKl1z4m1Dt7MeJjZjOfeiJGni9E3icWAfAjktuhgSVaM2D64H6je-WF6LHe1qOboHpZzFNKSx08Zhlcx3QWO6TRY-9Ar62vM= (Archived search result)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a history of internal promotion, which suggests positive relations. CEO Linda Rendle has been with the company since 2003 and has held numerous roles before becoming CEO in 2020. Other senior executives, such as the CFO and Chief Legal Officer, also have long tenures with the company. This stability at the top is indicative of a cohesive and well-functioning executive team with a consistent long-term vision.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox's public disclosures reveal a deep and experienced management team. The 2024 10-K lists 13 executive officers, including Group Presidents for its major segments (Care and Connection; Health and Hygiene) and C-suite leaders for all key functions like Strategy, Finance, Legal, People, and R&D. This structure indicates a clear line of succession and avoids over-reliance on a few key individuals, providing significant operational depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clorox's 2024 10-K includes a "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," which concluded that controls were effective as of June 30, 2024. The independent auditor, Ernst & Young, LLP, also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down sales and adjusted EBIT, which reflects a good level of cost analysis. During the 2023 cyberattack, the company deployed additional interim controls to maintain its financial reporting integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the consumer packaged goods industry, brand equity and market share are paramount indicators of competitive strength. Clorox excels here, stating that "About 80% of the Company's sales are generated from brands that hold the No. 1 or No. 2 market share positions in their categories". This dominance in a crowded retail environment demonstrates powerful brand loyalty, pricing power, and a superior competitive position that is difficult for rivals to challenge.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear long-range outlook. The company is making a multi-year investment of $560-$580 million in digital capabilities and a new ERP system, which is a significant short-term expense aimed at long-term efficiency and growth. Strategic portfolio shaping, such as the divestitures of the Argentina and VMS businesses, prioritizes long-term consistent, profitable growth over short-term sales figures. These actions show a willingness to absorb near-term costs and complexity for future benefit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm' (filed May 5, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong financial position that minimizes dilution risk. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Clorox generated $687 million in cash from operations. It has a $1.2 billion revolving credit facility for liquidity and a history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases rather than issuing new shares to fund operations. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, the company purchased $257 million of its own stock. This demonstrates a clear ability to fund operations and strategic investments through cash flow and debt capacity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107625000023/clx-20250331.htm' (filed May 5, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrated a high degree of candor during the major operational disruption caused by the August 2023 cyberattack. In the Q1 2024 earnings call on November 1, 2023, CEO Linda Rendle openly discussed the event, its impact on performance, and the company's recovery efforts, stating that prior to the attack performance was on track. The company proactively provided preliminary financial information in an October 4, 2023 press release due to the material impact of the event. This transparency during a crisis is a strong indicator of management's commitment to candid communication.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHxc7nTJmDFFFk_1ISEnX5mnz6S44IT6HLOI7uGsAQHa7KJ1JudNZmcFJ9FBrQHmCxS08fFlplbr86kZenr1WOR67vk_eSklZcp9EWVJKG9bSz591sV83cWXUhmCeG8nBf3EbBMQleHxopK5xAjCex1TyNVQNjWu_qxbMUFw6VUDBMolW3Drwk53qU-3qQ6pmrpSd3vMO4F5Kzw (Archived search result)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF4VahtEFxbQ2AJrpjlmEgTrFZ9i0pLLjsry4VkVGyssdXrLb98wxbZTogWeLrBuhrado--fYhzhI4sxRYTIFu2RAlJ_LfpenuhnXM8c377qhwsP2EER262cgted-f1_FO9nFW6eZpEPfOyfDTbirBAvB9mudVgXVd08e8CbujVmFQb8-FTL-TSpRi4puNsQH8= (Archived search result)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's legal proceedings, public filings, and news searches reveals no evidence of significant integrity lapses, such as major fraud, executive scandals, or ongoing SEC investigations. The 2024 10-K notes the company is "subject to routine litigation incidental to its business" but does not disclose any matters that would question the integrity of senior management. The company also maintains and promotes a detailed Code of Conduct for all employees, directors, and officers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEBM5h7EZ9t2f0IxAsOcel7S7-2I-DRMUrYoOiosYIPYbEuO9oB0H_Xb6GP00_K-qonpIMClcFArExPj35HoMkbaunJet1TJrhAKl1z4m1Dt7MeJjZjOfeiJGni9E3icWAfAjktuhgSVaM2D64H6je-WF6LHe1qOboHpZzFNKSx08Zhlcx3QWO6TRY-9Ar62vM= (Archived search result)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEJGa3v6Hxr4fGmZ8amE10R1ShSVEBAkPYwAEhE3Ocs3F_TN8LNPzs8jLRnteEPxbOCe7rpJgy99n1UgDAaKvmYC_PMNLUyr6G0QsWzMgawjfcNUGb5xJgSsVjb0QdpugzNxAV9MyxSZ7DzLdhm6INwTwfW2jHhcgK0mKB3KMuR8fAJELnxMNXA-AlBPmqoLAfxFQoK9E7_ (Archived search result)], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21076/000002107624000030/clx-20240630.htm' (filed August 8, 2024)]

Synthesis:
Clorox scores well on most of Fisher's qualitative points, demonstrating strong brand positioning, a stable and deep management team, a long-range outlook, and a culture of integrity and candor. The company's strengths lie in its dominant market share in key categories and its clear strategic focus on improving margins and investing for long-term efficiency. The primary weaknesses identified relate to its growth prospects, which are limited by the maturity of its core markets, and an R&D effort that, while consistent, is not superior to its peers. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its innovation pipeline in driving organic growth beyond market rates and the execution of its major digital transformation project. A successful ERP implementation that unlocks significant new efficiencies could improve the margin and R&D effectiveness scores, while a failure to accelerate top-line growth would reinforce the "No" on its long runway.

fisher score is 13 / 15
