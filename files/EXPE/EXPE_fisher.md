Company, August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and various news/trade sources.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**  
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia Group operates in the global travel market, which Phocuswright estimated at approximately $2.2 trillion for 2025, and the company's gross bookings represent only a single-digit percentage of this total, indicating a large addressable market. The company is focused on strategic growth areas including international market expansion beyond its core markets and growing its B2B segment. The B2B segment, in particular, has shown strong growth, with a 21% revenue increase in 2024 and a 14% increase in Q1 2025, driven by partnerships with major companies like Walmart, Chase, and United Airlines.  
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia Group is focused on leveraging its unified technology platform to accelerate feature releases and innovation. CEO Ariane Gorin has outlined a strategy for 2025 centered on using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to improve products for B2B partners and travelers, adapt to new AI-based search platforms, and drive operational efficiencies. The company has migrated its core consumer brands (Hotels.com and Vrbo) onto a single front-end stack and launched the 'One Key' unified loyalty program to drive retention and direct business.  
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia Group's "Technology and content" expense, which functions as its R&D, was approximately $1.31 billion in 2024, or 9.6% of total revenue. The company has focused this spending on a major platform migration to unify its core brands' technology infrastructure, aiming to increase feature release velocity and efficiency. This unification and the application of AI and machine learning are central to the company's strategy of improving the traveler experience and driving long-term growth. While direct R&D output metrics like patents are not detailed, the successful platform migration and launch of the 'One Key' loyalty program serve as tangible outputs of this investment.  
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales efforts are primarily reflected in its direct marketing spend and the growth of its B2B segment. Direct sales and marketing was $6.85 billion in 2024, a 12% increase from the prior year. The B2B segment, which services a wide range of partners, is a key growth engine, with gross bookings rising 17% YoY in Q2 2025, marking its 16th consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. This consistent, strong performance in the B2B channel, which relies on a dedicated sales and partner management team, indicates an effective sales organization.  
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Expedia Group reported revenue of $13.7 billion and an operating income of $1.3 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 9.6%. The company's Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 was $2.9 billion, yielding an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.4% on a revenue basis. While B2C segment margins are impacted by high marketing spend, the B2B segment shows strong profitability. The company has also focused on operational efficiency, which has supported margin expansion.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442425000008/expe-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442425000008/expe-20241231.htm) (February 6, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on driving operating efficiencies to expand margins. The company has undertaken restructuring actions in February 2024 and Q1 2025 to "recalibrate resources" after completing its major technological transformation, resulting in headcount reductions. Cost of revenue decreased in 2024 due to "ongoing initiatives to drive transactional efficiencies." Furthermore, the shift to a unified platform operating model is designed to improve the cost structure and operate more efficiently over the long term by reducing complexity and redundancy across its brands.  
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia Group has undertaken multiple rounds of restructuring and layoffs, including in February 2024 and March/April 2025, to "recalibrate resources." While the company states it is committed to an inclusive work environment and offers competitive benefits, repeated workforce reductions can negatively impact employee morale and relations. The company confirmed a restructuring in April 2025, describing the decisions as "difficult but necessary" to focus on strategic priorities. The recurring nature of layoffs suggests that labor relations may be strained, despite stated cultural goals.  
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant executive turnover in 2024-2025. Peter Kern stepped down as CEO, with Ariane Gorin taking the role in May 2024. Jon Gieselman, President of Expedia Brands, departed in June 2024, leading to the creation of new COO and CMO roles filled by internal promotions. While promoting from within for the COO and CMO roles suggests a development pipeline, the departure of the CEO and a key division president within a short period indicates a degree of instability at the highest levels.  
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Following the departure of the President of Expedia Brands, the company promoted two internal leaders, Brad Bentley and Jochen Koedijk, to COO and CMO, respectively. This indicates the presence of a talent pipeline for key leadership roles within the consumer business. The company also recently appointed a new CFO, Scott Schenkel, in late 2024. The B2B division, a major growth driver, is led by a separate president, and the company has established general managers for each of its core consumer brands to improve accountability.  
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia Group's financial statements are audited by Ernst & Young, LLP, which issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company's Audit Committee Charter outlines a clear process for overseeing the integrity of financial statements, the independent auditor, and the internal audit function. There is no evidence of recent material weaknesses or restatements. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down revenue and Adjusted EBITDA for its B2C, B2B, and trivago segments.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the online travel agency (OTA) industry, a key competitive advantage is the network effect: a large base of property listings and flight options attracts more travelers, which in turn attracts more suppliers. Expedia's platform features over 3.5 million lodging properties and over 500 airlines. The company's recent technology platform unification and the launch of the cross-brand 'One Key' loyalty program are strategic moves to strengthen this network effect and increase customer switching costs, a crucial factor in the competitive OTA landscape. These initiatives enhance data collection and personalization, further solidifying its market position.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia Group has undertaken a multi-year technological transformation, migrating its core brands onto a single platform. This extensive project caused near-term disruption, particularly for the Hotels.com brand, but was executed with the explicit goal of improving long-term efficiency, innovation speed, and growth. Management's strategic priorities for 2025 focus on long-term value creation through AI, international expansion, and margin expansion, indicating a long-range view. The significant investment in this platform overhaul demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice short-term performance for a more durable competitive advantage.  
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Expedia Group had $5.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $2.9 billion remaining on its share repurchase authorization. The company generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations in 2024 and has been actively returning capital to shareholders, repurchasing $1.6 billion of its stock in 2024 and paying a quarterly dividend starting in 2025. This strong cash generation and commitment to buybacks, coupled with a solid balance sheet, indicate a very low risk of needing dilutive equity financing.  
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management openly discussed the negative impacts and struggles of its platform migration on brands like Hotels.com and Vrbo in its financial reports and earnings calls. In its 2024 10-K, the company details the rationale behind the migration and the launch of One Key, acknowledging the complexities. CEO Ariane Gorin also noted the weaker travel demand in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2025 while still providing an overall positive outlook. This willingness to discuss challenges alongside successes suggests a good level of transparency with investors.  
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a formal "Boarding Pass" Employee Code of Conduct that explicitly outlines expectations for ethical and lawful conduct, including policies against corruption and for accurate financial reporting. The company's 10-K details various legal proceedings, including ongoing disputes with tax authorities in the U.S. and abroad, which is a normal course of business for a multinational corporation. There is no evidence of legal or regulatory actions that question the personal integrity of the senior executive team. The company's independent auditor has issued a clean opinion on its financial reporting and internal controls.  
**Answer:** Yes

---  
Synthesis:
Expedia Group scores well on its long-term strategic vision, particularly its multi-year investment in a unified technology platform and the development of its 'One Key' loyalty program to strengthen its competitive moat. The company operates in a massive addressable market and shows strong growth in its B2B segment, which diversifies its revenue streams. Its financial position is robust, with strong cash flow generation supporting significant share buybacks and the reinstatement of a dividend. The primary areas of concern are related to human capital, with recent executive turnover and multiple rounds of layoffs potentially signaling instability and impacting morale. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the success of the new CEO and leadership team in executing the next phase of growth, and the company's ability to stabilize its workforce and culture after a period of significant transformation and restructuring. A "No" on Labor and Executive Relations would flip to "Yes" with a period of sustained stability in the senior leadership team and the absence of further large-scale layoffs, coupled with positive employee feedback metrics.

fisher score is 13 / 15
