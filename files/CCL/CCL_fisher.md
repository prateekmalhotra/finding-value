Net income was $1.9 billion, for a net profit margin of 7.6%. While these margins are a significant improvement from the losses incurred during the pandemic, they are still below pre-pandemic levels. The company's profitability has been on an upward trend, with seven consecutive quarters of record revenues reported as of the end of FY2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (January 27, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival is focused on driving revenue and operating more efficiently to improve margins. The company is implementing cost-saving measures, such as optimizing itineraries with new, more fuel-efficient ships and investing in energy-saving technologies. Management is also focused on strengthening the company's balance sheet by reducing debt and interest expenses, which will improve net profit margins over time. In 2024, the company made debt prepayments of over $3 billion.
**Answer:** Yes

**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?

For example, Micky Arison, the Chair of the Boards of Directors has been with the company for 53 years, while other members of the executive team have joined more recently. The identical Boards of Directors for Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc, a feature of the DLC structure, promotes alignment and stability in governance. The company's filings do not indicate any significant executive turnover or disputes.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's corporate structure includes a team of executive officers with responsibility for various functions, such as finance, legal, and maritime operations. Each of the company's nine cruise brands has its own leadership team, providing a deep bench of operational and marketing expertise across different market segments. The company's multi-brand structure also enhances its succession planning process.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (January 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The company's annual report includes a detailed breakdown of revenues and expenses, as well as segment information, which provides a good level of transparency into its cost structure. Management's report on internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2024, concluded that their internal controls were effective.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's portfolio of nine distinct cruise brands is a key competitive advantage, allowing it to cater to a wide range of customer segments and price points. The company's large scale provides economies of scale in shipbuilding, purchasing, and overhead. Carnival's investment in exclusive destinations, such as Celebration Key and Half Moon Cay, provides a unique and differentiated product offering that can attract customers and enhance profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (January 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's long-term shipbuilding program, with deliveries scheduled through 2033, and its investments in new destinations demonstrate a focus on long-term growth. Carnival is also making significant investments in sustainability, such as its LNG-powered ships and energy efficiency upgrades, which may have near-term costs but are essential for long-term viability and regulatory compliance. Management's focus on strengthening the balance sheet and achieving investment-grade credit metrics also points to a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (January 27, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of May 31, 2025, Carnival had $5.2 billion of liquidity, including $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion available under its revolving credit facility. The company generated $5.9 billion in cash from operations in FY2024. While the company has a substantial amount of debt, it has been actively managing its debt profile, making over $3 billion in prepayments in 2024. The company has not recently announced any plans for significant equity financing, and its current cash flow and liquidity position appear sufficient to fund its capital expenditure commitments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm) (June 26, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (January 27, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's earnings call transcripts from the past few years, which includes the period of recovery from the pandemic, indicates that management communicates openly with investors about both its successes and challenges. The transcripts show detailed discussions of financial performance, booking trends, cost pressures, and strategic initiatives. The company's SEC filings also contain extensive risk factor disclosures, which provide a candid assessment of the potential challenges the business faces.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (January 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm) (June 26, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm) (March 25, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CCL/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CCL/transcripts/)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's Form 10-K and 10-Q filings disclose several legal proceedings and regulatory matters. While involvement in legal proceedings is not uncommon for a company of Carnival's size, the nature and number of these matters should be considered. There are no indications of major accounting scandals or management fraud in the recent filings. However, the ongoing legal and regulatory matters prevent a definitive "Yes" at this time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (January 27, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm) (June 26, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm) (March 25, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
Carnival scores well on most of Fisher's points, with its strong market position, commitment to growth, and improving financials. The company's biggest strengths are its diverse brand portfolio, which allows it to target a wide range of customers, and its scale, which provides significant competitive advantages. The main area of concern is the ongoing legal and regulatory matters, which prevent a perfect score on management integrity. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful launch and ramp-up of the Celebration Key destination, continued improvement in profit margins, and the resolution of outstanding legal proceedings. A favorable resolution of these legal matters would be the most likely catalyst to turn the one "No" into a "Yes".

**Fisher Score is 14 / 15**
