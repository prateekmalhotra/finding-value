**Operator**

Good morning, and welcome to the Gray Television First Quarter 2025 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Hilton Howell, Executive Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead.

**Hilton Howell**

Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. We’re very pleased with our start to 2025. As you saw in our release yesterday, we reaffirmed our revenue and operating expense guidance for the full year. Core advertising trends are improving sequentially, and we continue to see solid growth in our retransmission consent revenues. Political advertising is also off to a very strong start. We anticipate a record year for political advertising, driven by competitive gubernatorial and Senate races in many of our markets, as well as the presidential election.

Our balance sheet is strong. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $210 million and total leverage of 5.48x, as calculated under our senior credit facility. We continue to expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2025, which will provide us with ample financial flexibility to continue to invest in our business, opportunistically repurchase our debt and return capital to shareholders.

With that, I'll turn the call over to our President and Co-CEO, Pat LaPlatney.

**Pat LaPlatney**

Thank you, Hilton. Good morning, everybody. As Hilton mentioned, our core advertising business continues to show sequential improvement. First quarter core revenue was down 7.5%, which was slightly better than our guidance. The decline was primarily driven by the Super Bowl, which aired on CBS in 2024 and on FOX in 2025. Excluding the impact of the Super Bowl, our first quarter core advertising revenue would have been down approximately 4%.

We're seeing broad-based improvement across most of our key advertising categories, including automotive, which was up in the high single digits in the first quarter. We expect this positive momentum to continue into the second quarter and throughout the remainder of the year. Our second quarter core advertising revenue is currently pacing down in the low single-digit range.

Our local news ratings remain very strong. In the February sweeps period, our stations achieved a #1 or #2 ranking in 99 of our 113 markets. This strong performance is a testament to the hard work and dedication of our journalists and production teams, who are committed to providing our communities with the highest quality local news and information.

I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Jim Ryan, to discuss our financial results in more detail.

**Jim Ryan**

Thank you, Pat. Good morning, everyone. Total revenue for the first quarter was $782 million, a decrease of 5% from the prior year period. As Pat mentioned, the decline was primarily due to the Super Bowl. Broadcasting revenue was $755 million, down 5.5% from the prior year. Production company revenue was $27 million, up 12.5% from the prior year.

Operating expenses, before depreciation, amortization and gain on disposal of assets, were $629 million, a decrease of 2% from the prior year. The decrease was primarily due to lower programming and production costs.

Net income attributable to common stockholders was a loss of $22 million, or $0.23 per share. This compares to net income of $75 million, or $0.80 per share, in the prior year period.

Free cash flow for the quarter was $75 million. We ended the quarter with $210 million of cash on hand and total debt of $5.6 billion. Our total leverage ratio, as calculated under our senior credit facility, was 5.48x.

We are reaffirming our full year 2025 revenue guidance of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion and our full year operating expense guidance of $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. We expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2025, which we will use to continue to de-lever our balance sheet and return capital to shareholders.

With that, I’ll turn the call back over to the operator for questions.

**Question-and-Answer Session**

**Operator**

[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Dan Kurnos with Benchmark Company. Please go ahead.

**Dan Kurnos**

Great. Thanks. Good morning. Hilton, maybe just to start, could you just give us a little bit more color on the political outlook? Obviously, you guys are positioned really well for a strong cycle, but just curious if you could give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in terms of the cadence of spend and where you're seeing the most strength.

**Hilton Howell**

Sure, Dan. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting a record year for political. We're seeing strong spending across the board, from the presidential race down to the local level. In terms of cadence, we expect the second half of the year to be very strong, with the majority of the spending coming in the third and fourth quarters. In terms of where we're seeing the most strength, it's really broad-based. We're seeing strong spending in our gubernatorial and Senate races, as well as in the presidential race.

**Dan Kurnos**

Got it. That's helpful. And then, Pat, just on the core, you mentioned that auto was up in the high single digits. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what you're seeing in some of your other key categories? And then, just on the pacing for Q2, down low single digits, is that a net number?

**Pat LaPlatney**

Sure, Dan. In terms of other key categories, we're seeing strength in services, particularly in the legal and medical categories. We're also seeing improvement in retail. In terms of the Q2 pacing, yes, that is a net number.

**Dan Kurnos**

Great. Thanks for the color.

**Operator**

The next question comes from Aaron Watts with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.

**Aaron Watts**

Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Jim, just a couple for you. First, on the balance sheet, you ended the quarter at 5.48x. Can you just remind us what your target leverage is and how you're thinking about capital allocation going forward?

**Jim Ryan**

Sure, Aaron. Our target leverage is to get to the low 4s. In terms of capital allocation, our primary focus is on de-levering the balance sheet. We'll also continue to invest in our business and return capital to shareholders.

**Aaron Watts**

Okay. And then, just on the free cash flow, you mentioned you expect to generate significant free cash flow in 2025. Can you just give us a little bit more color on how you're thinking about that?

**Jim Ryan**

Sure. We haven't given specific guidance on free cash flow, but we do expect it to be a significant number. We'll use that cash to pay down debt and return capital to shareholders.

**Aaron Watts**

Great. Thanks, Jim.

**Operator**

The next question comes from Steven Cahall with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.

**Steven Cahall**

Thanks. Maybe first, Pat, just on the retrans side, you mentioned you're seeing solid growth there. Can you just talk about what you're seeing in terms of subscriber trends and how you're thinking about the outlook for the rest of the year?

**Pat LaPlatney**

Sure, Steven. We're continuing to see some pressure on the subscriber front, but we're still seeing solid growth in our retransmission consent revenues. We have a number of renewals coming up this year, and we're confident that we'll be able to get fair value for our content.

**Steven Cahall**

Great. And then, maybe just a follow-up for Jim. On the production business, revenue was up nicely in the quarter. Can you just talk about what's driving that and how you're thinking about the outlook for that business for the rest of the year?

**Jim Ryan**

Sure, Steven. The growth in the production business was primarily driven by our new Assembly Atlanta studio. We're very excited about the outlook for that business. We have a number of productions in the pipeline, and we expect to see strong growth for the remainder of the year.

**Steven Cahall**

Great. Thank you.

**Operator**

The next question comes from Craig Huber with Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.

**Craig Huber**

Yes, good morning. I had a question on the local TV station M&A front. What are you guys seeing out there? Are you seeing a lot of deals? Are you seeing attractive multiples? Just any color you could provide would be great.

**Hilton Howell**

Sure, Craig. We're always looking for opportunities to grow our business through strategic acquisitions. We're seeing a fair amount of deal flow, but we're being very disciplined in our approach. We're only going to do deals that make sense for our shareholders.

**Craig Huber**

Okay. And then, just a follow-up on the balance sheet. I know you said your target is to get to the low 4s. What's your timeframe for getting there?

**Jim Ryan**

Craig, we haven't given a specific timeframe, but we're confident that we can get there over the next couple of years.

**Craig Huber**

Great. Thank you.

**Operator**

This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Hilton Howell for any closing remarks.

**Hilton Howell**

Thank you, operator. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We're very pleased with our start to 2025, and we're confident that we're well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results for our shareholders. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media's primary revenue streams are advertising, retransmission consent fees, and its growing production companies segment. While traditional broadcasting faces headwinds from cord-cutting and competition from streaming services, the company is attempting to diversify. The company's large portfolio of top-rated local news stations provides a strong platform for political advertising, which is expected to be a significant driver of revenue in even-numbered election years. The company is also expanding its production facilities, such as Assembly Atlanta, which could provide a new growth avenue. However, the core business of local television broadcasting faces significant long-term challenges.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has shown a commitment to developing new revenue streams to augment its core broadcasting business. The company is investing in its production companies segment, including the Assembly Atlanta studio production facilities. Gray Media is also exploring opportunities to monetize its digital spectrum with the transition to the NextGen TV standard. The company has also been active in acquiring and divesting stations to optimize its portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925015405/gtn20250331_10q.htm', May 8, 2025.]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a media company, Gray Media does not have traditional R&D expenses. Instead, its development efforts are focused on content creation, technological upgrades, and strategic acquisitions. The company has been investing in its digital platforms and production capabilities. While the company does not disclose specific metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of these investments, the growth in its production company revenue suggests some success. However, without specific data on R&D spending and returns, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness relative to its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925015405/gtn20250331_10q.htm', May 8, 2025.]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media's large and diverse portfolio of top-rated local television stations provides a strong foundation for its sales organization. The company's ability to generate significant political advertising revenue in election years demonstrates its sales prowess in that key area. However, the company's core advertising revenue has been declining, which raises questions about the overall effectiveness of its sales organization in a challenging market. The company's reliance on a limited number of advertising categories, such as automotive and services, could also be a point of concern.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925015405/gtn20250331_10q.htm', May 8, 2025.], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GTN/transcripts/2025/1/', May 8, 2025.]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the three months ended March 31, 2025, Gray Media reported an operating margin of approximately 11.8% ($92 million operating income on $782 million of revenue). For the full year 2024, the operating margin was approximately 23.3% ($851 million operating income on $3.644 billion of revenue). The company's margins are subject to cyclicality, with higher margins in even-numbered years due to political advertising. While the company has a history of profitability, its margins can be volatile and are under pressure from declining advertising revenue and increasing programming costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925015405/gtn20250331_10q.htm', May 8, 2025.], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media is focused on prudent cost management to maintain and improve its margins. The company is also seeking to grow its higher-margin retransmission consent revenues and is investing in its production companies segment. The company's transition to the NextGen TV standard is expected to create new efficiencies and revenue opportunities. Additionally, Gray Media has been actively managing its debt portfolio to reduce interest expense.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GTN/transcripts/2025/1/', May 8, 2025.]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of February 21, 2025, Gray Media had 9,118 full-time and 384 part-time employees, with 510 full-time and 23 part-time employees at 17 stations represented by unions. The company states that it considers its relations with its employees to be good. Gray Media emphasizes its commitment to a safe and healthy workplace, diversity and inclusion, and investing in its employees. Without further evidence, such as employee turnover rates or independent employee reviews, it is difficult to definitively assess the quality of the company's labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Gray Media appears stable, with several long-tenured executives. The company's executive compensation is tied to performance, which should align the interests of management with those of shareholders. However, the presence of family members in key leadership positions (Hilton H. Howell, Jr. and Robin R. Howell) could raise corporate governance concerns for some investors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media's executive team includes a number of experienced professionals in key roles beyond the CEO, such as a President and Co-CEO, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Legal and Development Officer, and Chief Operating Officer. This suggests a good depth of management at the executive level. The company has also promoted from within, which can be a sign of a strong talent pipeline.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, RSM US LLP, which has provided an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company provides detailed segment reporting, which offers some insight into its cost structure. However, the company has not provided specific details about its cost analysis processes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925015405/gtn20250331_10q.htm', May 8, 2025.]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media's portfolio of #1 or #2 ranked local news stations in 99 of its 113 markets is a key competitive advantage in the broadcast television industry. This market leadership allows the company to command higher advertising rates and retransmission consent fees. The company's large national footprint and diversification across network affiliations also provide a competitive edge.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media's investments in its production companies segment and its exploration of new technologies like NextGen TV suggest a long-range outlook. The company has also been willing to make strategic acquisitions and divestitures to position itself for future growth. However, the company's focus on deleveraging and returning capital to shareholders could be seen as prioritizing short-term financial stability over long-term growth investments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GTN/transcripts/2025/1/', May 8, 2025.]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Gray Media had $210 million in cash and a total leverage ratio of 5.48x. The company expects to generate significant free cash flow in 2025, which it plans to use for debt reduction and shareholder returns. While the company's debt level is high, it has been actively managing its debt and has access to a revolving credit facility. The company has not indicated any plans for equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925015405/gtn20250331_10q.htm', May 8, 2025.], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GTN/transcripts/2025/1/', May 8, 2025.]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media's management team regularly holds earnings calls and provides detailed financial information in its SEC filings. In its Q1 2025 earnings call, management addressed the decline in core advertising revenue and provided context for the company's performance. The company also provides guidance on its future revenue and expenses. This suggests a willingness to communicate openly with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925015405/gtn20250331_10q.htm', May 8, 2025.], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GTN/transcripts/2025/1/', May 8, 2025.]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gray Media has a code of ethics that applies to all of its directors, executive officers, and employees. There are no recent major scandals or legal issues that would call into question the integrity of the company's management. However, the presence of family members in key leadership positions could be a corporate governance concern for some investors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/43196/000143774925005406/gtn20241231_10k.htm', February 27, 2025.]

**Synthesis:**

Gray Media, Inc. presents a mixed picture based on Fisher's 15 points. The company's strengths lie in its dominant market position in local news, which gives it a competitive advantage in the broadcasting industry. The company is also taking steps to diversify its revenue streams and manage its costs effectively. However, the long-term outlook for the traditional broadcasting industry is challenging, and the company's high debt level could be a concern. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12-24 months would be the success of the company's production companies segment, the pace of cord-cutting and its impact on retransmission consent revenues, and the company's ability to reduce its debt. A significant increase in production revenue or a stabilization of the traditional broadcasting business could turn some of the "No" answers into "Yes."

fisher score is 8 / 15
