### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit operates a global financial technology platform serving approximately 100 million customers. The company's strategy is centered on its AI-driven expert platform, which includes TurboTax, Credit Karma, QuickBooks, and Mailchimp. The Small Business & Self-Employed segment, its largest, grew 19% in fiscal 2024, driven by a 20% increase in Online Ecosystem revenue from customer growth and higher effective prices. This indicates a strong and expanding market for its core services. The company is focused on disrupting the mid-market (businesses with 10-100 employees) and expanding globally, suggesting significant addressable market still to be captured.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit has explicitly stated its strategy is to be an "AI-driven expert platform," making an "early bet on AI" in 2019. The company is heavily investing in Generative AI (GenAI) to deliver "done for you" experiences and accelerate productivity. Intuit utilizes its own financial large language models (LLMs) alongside those from other GenAI leaders. In its latest annual filing, the company noted its expectation to "continue to invest significant resources in our product development...including products and services incorporating artificial intelligence." This commitment is evidenced by ongoing enhancements to its core platforms like QuickBooks and TurboTax with AI-powered features.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, Intuit's research and development expenses were $2.75 billion, representing 17% of its $16.29 billion in total revenue. This level of investment is significant and supports its strategy of being an AI-driven platform. The company's focus is on enhancing existing products and developing new ones using AI and other advanced technologies. While direct output metrics are not detailed, the consistent growth in its online services, driven by new features and capabilities, suggests that R&D is effective at driving commercial results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit employs a multi-channel sales and distribution strategy that includes direct sales via its websites and call centers, mobile app stores, and partner channels (including accountants and retailers). The company’s continued revenue growth, particularly in the Small Business & Self-Employed segment which saw a 19% increase in fiscal 2024, points to a highly effective sales and marketing engine. For fiscal 2024, selling and marketing expenses were $4.31 billion, or 26% of revenue, indicating a significant and sustained investment in its go-to-market efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, Intuit reported total net revenue of $16.29 billion and operating income of $3.63 billion, yielding an operating margin of 22.3%. For the nine months ended April 30, 2025, operating margin improved to 30.6% ($4.58 billion in operating income on $15.0 billion in revenue). These margins are substantial for a company of its scale and demonstrate strong profitability. The Small Business & Self-Employed segment, its largest, posted a segment operating margin of 60% in fiscal 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm) (Filed May 22, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit is focused on leveraging AI to drive productivity and efficiency, which should support margins. In its fiscal 2024 10-K, the company states that its investment in AI and GenAI "provides a foundation for us to accelerate productivity, innovate at scale, and move with speed... in a cost-efficient way." In July 2024, the company initiated a reorganization plan focused on "reallocating resources to our key growth areas," which includes employee exits and closing real estate sites. This restructuring suggests a focus on optimizing its cost structure to support profitable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm) (Filed May 22, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit's 2024 10-K filing provides extensive disclosure on its human capital management, emphasizing a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), employee development, and a strong culture guided by its values. The company employs listening strategies like surveys and town halls to gather feedback. It offers competitive compensation, stock-based awards for most employees, and comprehensive benefits. However, in July 2024, Intuit initiated a restructuring plan that included the "exit of employees," which can negatively impact morale. Without specific data on attrition or employee satisfaction scores, the evidence is mixed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm) (Filed May 22, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and deep experience within the company. CEO Sasan K. Goodarzi has been with Intuit since 2004 (with a brief departure) and has held the CEO role since January 2019. Several other key executives, such as Laura A. Fennell (Chief People & Places Officer) and Kerry J. McLean (General Counsel), have been with the company for over a decade in various senior roles. Founder Scott Cook remains on the board, providing continuity. This long tenure among top leadership suggests a stable and cohesive executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit's leadership team demonstrates considerable depth, with experienced General Managers for its major segments (Consumer Group and Small Business & Self-Employed Group) and key functional heads like a Chief Technology Officer and Chief Financial Officer. Many executives have been promoted from within, such as CFO Sandeep S. Aujla, who previously led finance for the Small Business group, and CTO Alex G. Balazs, a 20+ year veteran of the company. This practice of internal promotion indicates a strong bench and succession planning. The detailed executive biographies in the 10-K show a team with broad experience both inside and outside Intuit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit's financial reporting is detailed, with clear segment disclosures of revenue and operating income. The independent auditor's report for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2024, provided an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. There is no mention of material weaknesses, restatements, or significant deficiencies in recent filings. The company's ability to provide detailed financial breakdowns by segment and sub-segment (e.g., Online Ecosystem vs. Desktop Ecosystem) suggests robust internal accounting controls and cost analysis capabilities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm) (Filed May 22, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit's key competitive advantage is its integrated ecosystem of financial products (QuickBooks, TurboTax, Credit Karma, Mailchimp), which creates significant network effects and high switching costs for customers. The company's platform strategy, leveraging vast amounts of customer data with AI, allows it to provide personalized insights and cross-sell services effectively. This "AI-driven expert platform" is designed to solve a wide range of customer financial problems, from tax and accounting to marketing and personal finance, creating a durable competitive moat that is difficult for point-solution competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's consistent emphasis on its "AI-driven expert platform strategy" and five "Big Bets" demonstrates a long-range focus. The company has sustained heavy investment in R&D ($2.75 billion in FY24) and Sales & Marketing ($4.31 billion in FY24) to support these long-term initiatives, even when it might pressure short-term margins. The strategy to disrupt the mid-market and expand globally are multi-year endeavors that prioritize durable growth over immediate profit maximization. This is further supported by their forward-looking statements about continued investment in AI and product development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit has a very strong financial position. As of April 30, 2025, the company had $6.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. It generated $4.9 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2024. The company consistently returns cash to shareholders via dividends ($1.0 billion in FY24) and share repurchases ($2.0 billion in FY24), signaling it has more than sufficient cash to fund operations and investments. While it issued stock for the Mailchimp acquisition in 2021, its primary funding for growth is internally generated cash flow, supplemented by debt when needed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm) (Filed May 22, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit provides detailed financial breakdowns and commentary in its quarterly earnings reports and calls, and the "Risk Factors" section of its 10-K is comprehensive and specific. For example, the company openly discusses competitive threats from the public sector, such as the IRS's direct filing system, and the challenges of combating fraud. The company’s earnings call transcripts show management addressing analyst questions directly on a variety of topics, including performance drivers and challenges.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/INTU/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/INTU/transcripts/) (Accessed August 23, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687824000039/intu-20240731.htm) (Filed September 4, 2024)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Intuit has faced regulatory scrutiny regarding its marketing of "free" tax products. On May 4, 2022, the company entered into a $141 million settlement with the attorneys general of all 50 states regarding these marketing practices, without admitting wrongdoing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) also filed an action, and in January 2024, the FTC Commissioners issued a final order requiring Intuit to adhere to certain marketing practices. While the company states its belief that the allegations are without merit, these regulatory actions and settlements raise questions about its marketing practices.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/896878/000089687825000022/intu-20250430.htm) (Filed May 22, 2025)

### Synthesis
Intuit scores strongly on most of Fisher's points, demonstrating a clear long-term strategy, robust financial health, and a deep competitive moat built around its integrated software ecosystem. The company's commitment to AI innovation, its strong market position, and its stable, experienced management team are significant positives. The primary negatives stem from recent events: a restructuring involving layoffs, which could impact employee relations, and regulatory settlements over marketing practices, which tarnish its otherwise strong reputation. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its AI-driven product enhancements in accelerating growth, the tangible outcomes of its restructuring on margins and employee morale, and its ability to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape without further integrity-related issues. Flipping the "No" on integrity to "Yes" would require a sustained period without regulatory actions and a clear demonstration of transparent marketing practices.
