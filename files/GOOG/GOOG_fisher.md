Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: SEC Filings, Company Earnings Call Transcripts, and reputable news sources.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's core business, Google Search, continues to grow and holds a dominant market share. Google Cloud is also a major growth driver, with the global cloud computing market expected to grow significantly. The company's "Other Bets" portfolio, which includes projects in areas like autonomous driving (Waymo) and life sciences (Verily), provides additional long-term growth opportunities.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet consistently invests heavily in research and development, with R&D expenses totaling over $45 billion in 2024. The company's ongoing investments in artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and other emerging technologies demonstrate a clear commitment to future growth. Recent earnings calls have highlighted a focus on developing and deploying new AI models and services.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Alphabet's R&D spending is substantial, the effectiveness of this spending has been questioned. While the company has a strong track record of innovation in its core businesses, some of its "Other Bets" have yet to generate significant revenue. The company's R&D as a percentage of revenue is in line with its peers, such as Microsoft and Amazon.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Google's advertising business is largely self-service, but its Cloud business requires a more traditional enterprise sales force. The company has been investing heavily in its cloud sales team and has seen strong growth in its customer base. However, it still trails Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in market share, suggesting that its sales organization may not be as effective as its competitors.
**Answer:** No

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet has consistently maintained high profit margins, with an operating margin of over 27% in 2024. This is well above the average for the technology sector. The company's strong profitability is driven by its dominant position in the online advertising market.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet has faced criticism in recent years over its handling of employee activism and its treatment of contract workers. The company has also been the subject of several high-profile employee walkouts. These issues suggest that the company's labor and personnel relations are not as strong as they could be.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's executive team has been relatively stable in recent years. The company's co-founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, are no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of the company, but they still hold a controlling interest.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's financial statements are audited by Ernst & Young, a reputable accounting firm. The company has not had any major accounting scandals or restatements in recent years. However, some critics have argued that the company's financial reporting could be more transparent, particularly with regard to its "Other Bets" segment.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's key competitive advantage is its massive user base and the vast amount of data it collects. This data allows the company to improve its products and services and to target advertising more effectively than its competitors. The company's network effects, particularly in its Search business, also create a strong barrier to entry for new competitors.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's "Other Bets" segment is a clear indication of its long-range outlook. The company is investing billions of dollars in these projects, even though they are not expected to generate significant revenue for many years. Management has consistently stated that it is focused on long-term growth and is willing to make investments that may not pay off in the short term.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with over $100 billion in cash and marketable securities. The company generates a significant amount of free cash flow, which is more than enough to fund its growth initiatives. Alphabet also has a share repurchase program in place, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet's management has been criticized for its lack of transparency at times. The company has been particularly tight-lipped about its "Other Bets" segment and has not always been forthcoming about the challenges it has faced. However, the company has become more transparent in recent years, and its earnings calls now provide a good amount of detail on its performance.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alphabet has faced a number of legal and regulatory challenges in recent years, including antitrust lawsuits and investigations into its data collection practices. These issues raise questions about the company's commitment to ethical conduct. While the company has taken steps to address these concerns, they remain a significant overhang.

**Synthesis:**
Alphabet scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its financial strength, profitability, and long-term growth potential. The company's dominant position in the online advertising market and its strong balance sheet give it a significant competitive advantage. However, the company faces a number of challenges, including growing regulatory scrutiny, questions about the effectiveness of its R&D spending, and concerns about its labor relations and management integrity. The score could be most impacted in the next 12-24 months by the outcome of the ongoing antitrust lawsuits and the company's ability to demonstrate a clearer return on its investments in "Other Bets". A resolution of the antitrust cases in Alphabet's favor and a clear path to profitability for one or more of the "Other Bets" could turn the "No" on integrity and R&D effectiveness to a "Yes".

fisher score is 10 / 15
