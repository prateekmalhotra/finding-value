3.  **Economic Downturn:** A significant economic downturn could lead to a decrease in student enrollment as people choose to work instead of pursuing education.

**11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Legacy Education is well-positioned for significant growth in the near term. The acquisition of CCMCC is a transformative event that is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings. The launch of new, in-demand programs will further drive organic growth.
