Global Payments Inc., August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025, and various news/trade sources.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Global Payments operates in the expansive digital payments market, which continues to benefit from the secular shift away from cash. The company is pursuing significant growth opportunities by expanding its software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions for small and mid-sized businesses (SMBs) and enhancing its e-commerce capabilities. A key strategic initiative is the pending acquisition of Worldpay, expected to close in the first half of 2026, which is projected to nearly double the company's net revenue base to approximately $12.5 billion and accelerate high-single-digit revenue growth in the medium term. Management is also focused on unifying its point-of-sale (POS) solutions under the "Genius" brand and expanding them globally.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has clearly articulated a strategy focused on innovation at the intersection of software and payments. The company is making substantial investments in modernizing its technology, including migrating platforms to the cloud to improve speed-to-market and drive efficiencies. The launch and global expansion of its "Genius" POS platform for retail and hospitality is a core part of this strategy. Furthermore, the planned acquisition of Worldpay is a transformative move to significantly enhance its scale and capabilities, particularly in e-commerce and for large enterprise clients.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240925585143/en/Global-Payments-Shares-Updated-Strategy-and-Medium-Term-Outlook-at-Investor-Conference"] (September 25, 2024), ["https://finimize.com/content/global-payments-bets-big-on-worldpay-deal-and-digital-shift"] (August 20, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company's financial filings do not break out Research & Development as a separate line item, its capital expenditures reflect significant investment in technology and product development. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company reported capital expenditures of $127.6 million, directed toward new technologies, infrastructure, and enhancing its cloud-based solutions. The company's strategy involves unifying its POS business under the Genius brand, indicating a focus on creating integrated and scalable products. However, without specific R&D spending figures or direct metrics on the output (like patent filings or new product revenue contribution), a definitive conclusion on its effectiveness relative to peers is difficult.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Global Payments utilizes a multi-channel sales approach, including direct sales, referral partnerships with financial institutions, and integrated software vendors (ISVs). The company's strategy emphasizes prioritizing SMBs to deliver a full suite of software and commerce solutions. In its Merchant Solutions segment, the "Integrated and Embedded Solutions" business is a key growth driver, with revenues increasing 6.1% in the first quarter of 2025, showing success in its partner-led distribution channels. The planned acquisition of Worldpay will also significantly expand its sales reach to large enterprise clients globally.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025), ["https://finimize.com/content/global-payments-bets-big-on-worldpay-deal-and-digital-shift"] (August 20, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Global Payments has demonstrated strong profitability. For the quarter ended March 31, 2025, the company reported a consolidated operating margin of 19.5%. The Merchant Solutions segment, its largest, had an even stronger operating margin of 34.0%. Recent reports from August 2025 indicate the company's adjusted operating margin improved to 44.6%, well above its five-year average and the market average. This is attributed to effective cost controls and a strategic focus on higher-margin software solutions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025), ["https://finimize.com/content/global-payments-bets-big-on-worldpay-deal-and-digital-shift"] (August 20, 2025), ["https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/global-payments-q2-2025-earnings-preview-analysts-expect-eps-of-305-on-236b-revenue-3361814"] (August 20, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has launched a significant "business transformation initiative" aimed at streamlining operations and creating efficiencies. This initiative is expected to generate over $600 million in annual run-rate operating income benefit by the first half of 2027. Specific actions include combining business operations, streamlining technology infrastructure, and eliminating duplicative corporate structures. The company is also divesting non-core assets, such as the completed sale of AdvancedMD and the pending divestiture of its Issuer Solutions business, to focus on its higher-growth, higher-margin merchant acquiring business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public filings do not indicate any significant labor-related issues, such as strikes or disputes. The Form 10-Q mentions actions taken in 2024 to "align our workforce to our new operating model," which resulted in lower compensation expenses, but provides no further detail on employee morale or attrition rates. Without more specific disclosures on employee engagement, turnover, or independent workplace reviews, it is not possible to definitively assess the state of its personnel relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current CEO, Cameron Bready, has been in the role since 2023, suggesting a recent but seemingly stable transition at the top. Insider transactions in August 2025 showed minor sales by two executives, which were positioned as being for personal liquidity needs rather than a lack of confidence in the company. The total insider ownership percentage is low at 0.41%. While there are no overt signs of executive infighting, the information available is insufficient to confirm "outstanding" relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://finimize.com/content/global-payments-bets-big-on-worldpay-deal-and-digital-shift"] (August 20, 2025), ["https://markets.buffett.com/stocks/GPN/insider-transactions"] (August 22, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations website and SEC filings list a full suite of executives beyond the CEO, including a President and COO, CFO, and leaders for various business units and regions. The company's ability to execute complex, large-scale M&A, such as the pending Worldpay acquisition and the divestiture of the Issuer Solutions business, suggests a capable and deep management team is in place to handle strategic initiatives. The most recent Form 10-Q was signed by the Chief Financial Officer, Joshua J. Whipple, indicating clear roles and responsibilities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Global Payments provides detailed segment reporting for its Merchant and Issuer Solutions businesses, including breakdowns of revenues and operating expenses, which allows for clear analysis. The company's Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2025, contains a statement from management, including the CEO and CFO, certifying the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. The report also states there were no changes in internal control over financial reporting that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, internal controls. There is no evidence of recent restatements or material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the payments industry, scale, distribution, and integrated software are key differentiators. GPN's "economic moat comes from flexible software, a global processing network, sticky merchant relationships, and recurring revenue." The company's strategy to unify its POS solutions under the "Genius" brand and expand its embedded and integrated payment solutions points to a focus on creating ecosystem lock-in. The pending acquisition of Worldpay will substantially increase its scale and competitive standing, particularly in the high-growth e-commerce channel.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240925585143/en/Global-Payments-Shares-Updated-Strategy-and-Medium-Term-Outlook-at-Investor-Conference"] (September 25, 2024), ["https://finimize.com/content/global-payments-bets-big-on-worldpay-deal-and-digital-shift"] (August 20, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy demonstrates a long-range focus. The company is undertaking a multi-year transformation initiative expected to deliver benefits through 2027 and is engaging in a major acquisition (Worldpay) that will require significant integration effort before its full financial benefits are realized. In its 2024 Investor Conference, the company provided a medium-term outlook for 2025 through 2027, targeting accelerating EPS growth into the low-teens and a return of $7.5 billion to shareholders over that three-year period, indicating a clear long-term plan.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240925585143/en/Global-Payments-Shares-Updated-Strategy-and-Medium-Term-Outlook-at-Investor-Conference"] (September 25, 2024), ["https://finimize.com/content/global-payments-bets-big-on-worldpay-deal-and-digital-shift"] (August 20, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Global Payments generates strong free cash flow and uses a mix of cash and debt for its capital allocation. The company has an active share repurchase program, buying back 4.2 million shares for $449.0 million in the first three months of 2025 alone. While the acquisition of Worldpay involves issuing 43.3 million shares of GPN stock, this is part of a strategic transaction that also involves divesting a business for a significant amount of cash, and management has a stated goal of returning $7.5 billion to shareholders over the next three years, suggesting confidence in its ability to manage its capital structure without undue dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company regularly holds earnings calls and investor day events to communicate its strategy and performance. Recent transcripts and reports show management discussing both successes, like margin improvement, and challenges, such as the revenue miss in Q2 2025. The acknowledgment of activist investor interest and the detailed strategic updates provided at its investor conference suggest a willingness to engage with the market on key issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240925585143/en/Global-Payments-Shares-Updated-Strategy-and-Medium-Term-Outlook-at-Investor-Conference"] (September 25, 2024), ["https://finimize.com/content/global-payments-bets-big-on-worldpay-deal-and-digital-shift"] (August 20, 2025), ["https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GPN/transcripts/"] (August 2025), ["https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/global-payments-q2-2025-earnings-preview-analysts-expect-eps-of-305-on-236b-revenue-3361814"] (August 20, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section of the most recent Form 10-Q states that the company is party to claims and lawsuits incidental to its business but that management does not expect them to have a material adverse effect. There are no mentions of major scandals, regulatory actions, or governance red flags in the reviewed sources. The company's financial reporting appears transparent, and it complies with SEC regulations, including insider trading disclosures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1123360/000112336025000030/gpn-20250331.htm"] (May 6, 2025), ["https://markets.buffett.com/stocks/GPN/insider-transactions"] (August 22, 2025)

---
Synthesis:
Global Payments scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its strong market position, clear growth strategy, and robust profitability. The company's primary strengths lie in its long-term growth runway fueled by the secular shift to digital payments and the transformative potential of the Worldpay acquisition. Management has a clear, long-range focus on improving margins through operational efficiencies and strategic portfolio adjustments. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of the Worldpay integration and the divestiture of the Issuer Solutions business. Evidence of achieving the projected $600 million in annual synergies from the Worldpay deal would be a major positive. To flip the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to provide more transparent metrics on R&D spending and effectiveness, as well as more concrete data on employee relations, such as turnover and engagement scores.

fisher score is 12 / 15
