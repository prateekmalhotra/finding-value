Company: The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company (GT)
Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Annual Report (Form 10-K) filed February 14, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear operates in the mature and highly competitive global tire industry. The company's own data shows a decline in worldwide tire unit sales from 184.5 million in 2022 to 166.6 million in 2024, with its largest segment, replacement tires, also shrinking. While the company is strategically focused on higher-growth areas like electric vehicle (EV) tires and other large-rim-diameter products, these are niches within a broader market that is not demonstrating significant growth potential. The "Goodyear Forward" plan focuses more on margin improvement and portfolio optimization than on projecting a sizable increase in overall sales.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to new development. In 2024, the company launched multiple new product lines across all regions, including the Goodyear ElectricDrive 2, the Goodyear Assurance WeatherReady 2, and the Cooper Discoverer Stronghold AT, specifically targeting evolving market needs like EVs and SUVs. Furthermore, Goodyear has established a long-term goal to "introduce the industry's first 100% sustainable material tire by 2030," indicating a focus on future-oriented product development. This commitment is a core pillar of its strategy to remain competitive in a changing automotive landscape.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Based on 2022 industry data, Goodyear's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue was 2.84%, which is in line with its largest competitors, Michelin (2.88%) and Bridgestone (2.94%). The company's R&D output appears effective, as it holds approximately 5,700 patents worldwide and operates three dedicated R&D facilities. The consistent launch of new, technologically relevant products, such as those for the EV market, demonstrates that its R&D spending translates into tangible commercial offerings that keep it competitive with peers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Despite a broad distribution network that includes independent dealers, national retailers, and approximately 800 company-owned stores, Goodyear's sales performance has been below average. Total tire unit sales declined from 184.5 million in 2022 to 166.6 million in 2024, and net sales fell from $20.8 billion to $18.9 billion over the same period. The company's filings acknowledge challenges in the U.S. consumer replacement business due to increased competition from lower-tier imports, indicating the sales organization is struggling to maintain market share and volume.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear's profit margins are not worthwhile compared to peers or its own targets. The company's total segment operating margin was 7.0% in 2024, while its net profit margin was just 0.37% ($70 million net income on $18.9 billion in sales). For comparison, 2022 data showed major competitors Michelin and Bridgestone with profit margins of 12.5% and 13.1%, respectively. The central goal of the "Goodyear Forward" plan is to double the segment operating margin to 10% by the end of 2025, which is an acknowledgment by management that current profitability is inadequate.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFC_p422_8xKS-eSoNuBjrzGqEwJKmMOoJRhsyJ4KEpztqV1LnMztVSDN248Oo3DRVNGfPfd16p7MKHfVMFv9jNC-17BruQt9k6VHBw9m_7o7SoShubXY6QaL8qGP5WBXs40mCv7uuYGuEJy7hIQ8GC6NTzEuKZK8jP3vGG](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFC_p422_8xKS-eSoNuBjrzGqEwJKmMOoJRhsyJ4KEpztqV1LnMztVSDN248Oo3DRVNGfPfd16p7MKHfVMFv9jNC-17BruQt9k6VHBw9m_7o7SoShubXY6QaL8qGP5WBXs40mCv7uuYGuEJy7hIQ8GC6NTzEuKZK8jP3vGG) (April 16, 2022)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is executing a comprehensive transformation plan, "Goodyear Forward," announced in November 2023, which is entirely focused on margin improvement. The plan targets an annual run-rate cost reduction of $1.3 billion by the end of 2025 through actions like closing high-cost manufacturing facilities in Germany and Malaysia. It also includes portfolio optimization via the sale of its chemical, OTR tire, and Dunlop brand businesses, and top-line actions to improve price/mix. The plan already delivered $480 million in benefits to segment operating income in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Approximately 56% of Goodyear's global workforce is unionized. A significant risk exists as approximately 22,000 associates outside the U.S. are covered by union contracts that had expired or were set to expire during 2025. This large number of concurrent negotiations creates uncertainty. Furthermore, the "Goodyear Forward" plan involves closing multiple manufacturing plants, including two in the heavily unionized German market, which is likely to strain relations with labor groups in that region. Given the scale of restructuring and contract renewals, relations cannot be considered outstanding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has undergone significant leadership changes recently. Mark W. Stewart was appointed Chief Executive Officer and President on January 29, 2024, replacing the previous CEO after a period of operational underperformance and shareholder pressure that led to the "Goodyear Forward" plan. Other recent changes include a new Chief Human Resources Officer (July 2024) and a new Senior Vice President of Global Manufacturing (January 2025). Such substantial turnover at the highest levels indicates a period of instability and does not meet the criterion for "outstanding" executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear's 2024 10-K discloses a full management team with clearly defined senior leadership roles beyond the CEO. This includes presidents for each of its three geographic business units (Americas; EMEA; Asia Pacific) and heads of key functions like Finance, Technology, and Human Resources. Many of these leaders, including the regional presidents, have long tenures at Goodyear, suggesting a deep bench of experience in the company and the tire industry. For instance, the President of Americas joined in 2003, and the President of Asia Pacific joined in 2008.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, the company's independent registered public accounting firm, issued an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Goodyear's management also concluded that its internal controls were effective. The company provides clear, detailed segment reporting for its regional business units, and there is no indication of material weaknesses or recent restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the tire industry, brand recognition and manufacturing cost structure are critical competitive factors. While Goodyear possesses a globally recognized brand, a crucial negative clue is its cost structure. The company explicitly states in its 10-K Risk Factors: "our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors." This cost disadvantage is a primary driver for the "Goodyear Forward" restructuring plan, which includes closing higher-cost facilities. This admission highlights a significant structural weakness relative to its competition.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Goodyear Forward" plan is the definitive evidence of a long-range outlook. The company is incurring significant near-term rationalization charges ($86 million in 2024) and undertaking the strategic disruption of selling three major business lines to achieve a more profitable and competitive structure by the end of 2025. This willingness to absorb substantial short-term costs and complexity in pursuit of doubling its long-term operating margin target to 10% is a clear example of prioritizing durable future profitability over immediate results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Goodyear had a solid liquidity position with $810 million in cash and $3.56 billion in unused credit availability. While the company carries a substantial debt load of $7.8 billion, its strategic plan explicitly addresses this by using proceeds from the sales of its OTR and Dunlop businesses (grossing over $1.4 billion) to reduce leverage. The company is funding its transformation and capital expenditures through cash flow, available credit, and asset sales, not through the issuance of dilutive equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public disclosures demonstrate a high degree of candor regarding its challenges. The 2024 10-K openly discusses declining sales volumes, unfavorable price/mix, and competitive pressures. Most notably, the "Risk Factors" section contains the frank admission that "our manufacturing footprint is less cost-competitive than that of our principal competitors," a direct acknowledgment of a core strategic weakness. The public announcement and detailed explanation of the "Goodyear Forward" turnaround plan further exemplifies this transparency with the market about its operational and financial shortcomings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's integrity cannot be considered "unquestionable" at this time. On January 30, 2024, the European Commission conducted "unannounced inspections" at Goodyear's premises as part of an investigation into potential violations of EU antitrust rules (i.e., price fixing) in the tire industry. Goodyear has also been named in subsequent civil antitrust lawsuits in the United States. While the company is cooperating and no judgment has been made, being the subject of a major antitrust probe involving government raids raises significant questions that preclude an assessment of unquestionable integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/42582/000095017025020763/gt-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**Synthesis:**

Goodyear's current Fisher score reflects a company in the midst of a deep, necessary transformation. The strongest positives are clustered around its strategic clarity and governance: the company has a detailed plan to fix its poor margins (Point 6), is willing to make tough long-term decisions (Point 12), and is candid with investors about its problems (Point 14). It also maintains solid R&D effectiveness (Point 3) and good accounting controls (Point 10). However, these strengths are overshadowed by fundamental business weaknesses, including declining sales in a mature market (Points 1, 4), uncompetitive profit margins and cost structure (Points 5, 11), and significant instability in labor and executive relations (Points 7, 8). The most critical variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the execution of the "Goodyear Forward" plan. Evidence of sustained margin improvement toward the 10% target and a stabilization of sales volumes would be required to flip "No" answers on profitability and the sales organization to "Yes." Additionally, a clean resolution of the European antitrust investigation would be necessary to change the "No" on integrity.

**fisher score is 8 / 15**
