Wolverine World Wide, Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed February 22, 2025 (for fiscal year ended December 28, 2024).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates in the large global footwear and apparel market. However, it is undergoing a significant contraction and strategic repositioning, having divested several brands like Sperry and Keds. Total revenue for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, declined 21.8% to $1.76 billion, with its core Active and Work groups shrinking by 13.4% and 5.3%, respectively. While management is focusing on core brands (Merrell, Saucony, Wolverine) it believes have the most potential, the current, verifiable evidence shows a steep sales decline, not a clear path to sizable increases.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's stated strategy is to offer "innovative products and compelling brand propositions." The 2024 10-K highlights brand-specific innovations, such as Saucony's PWRRUN™ cushioning and Merrell's focus on design and testing for its leadership position in hiking footwear. As part of its transformation, the company is focusing resources on these core brands. Furthermore, it entered into new global licensing agreements for Merrell and Saucony kids' footwear and apparel in May 2024, representing a capital-light approach to developing new revenue streams.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wolverine World Wide does not disclose its Research & Development spending as a separate line item in its financial statements; it is included within SG&A expenses. The MD&A section of the 2024 10-K mentions a $7.8 million decrease in "product development costs" but provides no total figure. Without transparent reporting of R&D investment, it is not possible to assess its effectiveness relative to company size or to benchmark it against peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** An effective sales organization should deliver consistent growth. In fiscal 2024, Wolverine's revenue fell 21.8%. This decline was broad-based, with the Active Group's revenue falling 13.4% and the Work Group's falling 5.3%. Direct-to-consumer revenue, a key channel for brand engagement and margin, also declined by 16.9% in the same period. These results indicate the sales organization is currently underperforming relative to the market.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal 2024, Wolverine’s gross margin was 44.5% and its operating margin was 5.75%. Industry data from August 2025 shows an average gross margin for the Footwear & Accessories sector of 47.9%. High-performing competitor Deckers Brands reported a gross margin of 55.6% and an operating margin of approximately 21.6% for its fiscal year 2024. WWW's margins are below the industry average and substantially lag those of top-tier competitors, indicating they are not currently "worthwhile."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEVi2UCik0GYdJk-m8JfRChZGHSf4geqGcnZPFQtCv5ZIpmo35KL0__jfuT6gp4C5LCoT5T6Q1BMEEIAobF5ExV5HCPMgs2AVDfLYWXFJ15ReKv4AvRN5j_NM8iby-wd_vnR583BP7UcY-H, August 2025], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEyWxJThg5eTDMZe1KU8Jim5y3WG3rQpF5jcYZQIk8lOduczS-JrQG03I4UZXXzZXaAI4zaJy6SIAVWtS3NISxsxkTiURssGo_E7u0n4xPTmkP8AFZIwI5NGSYGUVhzmEHlFUGVnzEZBk1BHke1BEFzadw7_DsdW6dk1C5Bd5NZsbas1mSvcGZXVMe5qJ_-lLkfU7YXwgvm9CT3ilYPEJ7pmKUi8E72_1mAFVWVNYhzphBuRbHl7ECGnVJa6hYkLO1KwXSbW6e2Rrj44_-X3Cnfqcd2yi5YTabyUBTnqH54, May 23, 2024]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is taking significant actions to improve profitability. Gross margin increased from 38.9% in 2023 to 44.5% in 2024, driven by "less end-of-life inventory sales, lower supply chain costs and lower product costs." The company has also aggressively managed operating expenses, which decreased substantially in 2024 due to lower G&A, selling, advertising, and distribution costs. The strategic divestiture of the Sperry and Keds brands is a key part of this effort to simplify the organization and improve its profit profile.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K describes its human capital strategy, which includes competitive compensation and benefits, leadership development programs, and Employee Resource Groups to foster an inclusive culture. The filings do not mention any material labor disputes, strikes, or unionization issues. Based on available disclosures, which lack any negative indicators, personnel relations appear to be stable and well-managed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been significant recent turnover in the executive suite, which runs counter to Fisher's preference for stable, long-tenured teams. Christopher Hufnagel was appointed CEO in August 2023. More recently, Taryn Miller was hired as CFO in May 2024 and Susan Kuhn was hired as President of the Active Group in October 2024. This level of change at the highest levels, while potentially necessary for a turnaround, indicates instability rather than outstanding, long-term executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a full executive team covering key functions like Finance, HR, Legal, and International, in addition to the CEO and a president for its largest operating group. The new CFO and Active Group President bring extensive senior-level experience from other large, publicly traded companies (Kimberly-Clark, Corteva, and Foot Locker). The new Chief Legal Officer is an internal promotion, suggesting some bench strength within the organization. This structure and the experience of the team indicate sufficient management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified audit opinion from Ernst & Young LLP. In Item 9A, management concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective, and their assessment of internal control over financial reporting was also deemed effective, a conclusion with which the auditor concurred. The company has not reported any material weaknesses or restatements, indicating that its accounting controls are sound.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In footwear, brand equity and desirability are the most critical competitive assets. While Wolverine owns brands with strong heritage like Merrell and Saucony, recent financial results give negative clues about their competitive standing. The company took massive impairment charges on its Sperry and Sweaty Betty brands in recent years, totaling over $400 million in 2022 alone, signaling a significant deterioration in brand value. The sharp sales declines across its portfolio contrast with strong growth at competitors, suggesting WWW's brands have lost momentum with consumers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is executing a multi-year transformation that clearly prioritizes long-term stability over short-term results. The company has divested major revenue-producing brands (Sperry, Keds) to simplify the business, focus on its core portfolio, and strengthen the balance sheet. These actions, along with incurring significant short-term reorganization costs, demonstrate a willingness to absorb near-term pain for the prospect of a more profitable and durable long-range future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has significantly improved its financial position. In fiscal 2024, it generated $180.1 million in cash from operations and received over $100 million from divestitures. This was used to reduce total debt from $920.8 million to $648.0 million. With positive operating cash flow, $152.1 million in cash on hand, and $724.0 million available on its revolving credit facility, the company has ample liquidity to fund its operations and investments without needing to issue dilutive equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s public filings exhibit a high degree of candor regarding its challenges. The 2024 10-K’s Management Discussion and Analysis section provides a transparent breakdown of the sales declines by brand and openly discusses the reasons, such as "softer consumer demand." The extensive discussion of the brand divestiture strategy and the large impairment charges recorded are clear acknowledgments of past problems and the difficult steps being taken to correct them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While there are no indications of financial malfeasance by the current executive team, the company is still managing the fallout from a significant legacy environmental issue. Note 17 of the 10-K details ongoing litigation and remediation related to PFAS contamination from a former company tannery. This issue has resulted in a Consent Decree with the EPA and significant liabilities, with a remaining reserve of $39.7 million. A long-running environmental issue of this scale, which has impacted a community's water supply, calls into question the company's historical record and prevents an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/110471/000011047125000046/www-20241228.htm, February 22, 2025]

**Synthesis:**

Wolverine World Wide scores a 8 out of 15 on the Fisher checklist, profiling a company in the depths of a difficult but necessary turnaround. The positives center on strong financial management and strategic clarity: the company is generating cash, paying down debt, and taking decisive (if painful) action to improve margins and focus on a smaller core of brands. Management is transparent with investors about its challenges and appears to have the operational and financial controls in place to execute its plan. However, the negatives are significant and directly related to business performance. Sales are falling sharply, profit margins are below average, brand values have been impaired, and the new executive team is largely unproven in their current roles.

The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on the success of the new management team in stabilizing and reigniting growth in the core Merrell and Saucony brands. Evidence of sustained organic revenue growth and market share gains in the Active Group would be the most powerful catalyst to flip the scores on "Products/Services with Long Runway" (Point 1) and "Above-Average Sales Organization" (Point 4) from No to Yes. Conversely, a failure to halt the sales decline could put the company's long-term strategy and management stability back into question.

fisher score is 8 / 15
