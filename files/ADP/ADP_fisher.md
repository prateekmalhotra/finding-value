**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP has a stated strategic priority to "Lead with Best-in-Class HCM Technology." This is demonstrated by the launch of ADP Assist and the integration of generative AI into its "Roll by ADP" mobile solution. The company also operates ADP Ventures, a corporate venture capital arm and innovation lab, to invest in and partner with tech startups that advance its innovation strategy. This commitment is further evidenced by the acquisition of Sora, a low-code workflow automation tool, to enhance its integration capabilities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP invested approximately $1.276 billion in research and development for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. This investment supports the development of new products and the enhancement of existing technologies, including significant investments in generative AI. The launch of ADP Assist, which won the "Generative AI Innovation Award" in the 2024 AI Breakthrough Awards, is a tangible result of these efforts. ADP's R&D spending enables it to compete effectively with other large players like Workday and Oracle in the HCM technology space.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP markets its solutions primarily through its direct sales force, supplemented by indirect channels like relationships with accountants and banks. The company's ability to serve over 1.1 million clients, from single-employee businesses to large enterprises, demonstrates the breadth and effectiveness of its sales organization. For fiscal year 2024, Employer Services (ES) new business bookings grew by 7%, and client revenue retention was a strong 92%. This indicates a successful sales and client management engine.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, ADP reported an Earnings Before Income Taxes (EBIT) margin of 25.4%, an increase of 70 basis points from the prior year. The Employer Services segment, its largest, had a margin of 35.1%. These margins are robust and demonstrate the company's profitability and operational efficiency at scale.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's EBIT margin increased by 70 basis points in fiscal 2024, attributed to operating efficiencies from servicing clients on a growing revenue base and increased interest income on corporate funds. Management's discussion highlights that these gains were achieved despite increased selling expenses and R&D investments. The company is also engaged in "workforce optimization" efforts, which included severance costs in fiscal 2024, suggesting a focus on maintaining cost discipline to support margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's 2024 10-K details a comprehensive Human Capital Management strategy focused on valuing, developing, and engaging its approximately 64,000 employees. The company emphasizes a culture of inclusion, diversity, equity, and belonging, supported by initiatives like Business Resource Groups (BRGs) and an annual "myVoice" culture survey. ADP has received numerous employer-of-choice awards, including being named one of Fortune's World's Most Admired Companies for 18 consecutive years. There are no indications of significant labor disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information regarding the tenure and compensation of top executives is typically found in the Proxy Statement (DEF 14A), which was not provided. However, the 10-K, signed by the CEO, CFO, and Chief Accounting Officer, presents a consistent and clear strategic vision. There is no public information available from the provided documents to suggest discord or instability among the senior executive team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the 10-K primarily features the CEO and CFO in its commentary, it describes a robust governance structure, including a Chief Human Resources Officer who manages the HCM strategy with the Executive Leadership Team. The company's succession planning process is mentioned as a tool to develop executives. The successful operation of a global company with over a million clients and multiple complex service lines implies significant management depth across its various segments and functions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, on the financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2024. The report mentions no material weaknesses. The financial statements provide detailed segment reporting and clear disclosure of revenues, expenses, and other financial items, indicating robust accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the HCM industry, data scale is a significant competitive advantage. ADP possesses one of the industry's largest and deepest HCM datasets, with over 1.1 million clients and 42 million wage earners globally. This data powers its ADP DataCloud analytics platform and AI-driven tools like ADP Assist, creating a moat that is difficult for smaller competitors to replicate. Furthermore, ADP's ability to handle complex compliance and regulatory requirements, including having implemented Binding Corporate Rules (BCRs) for GDPR, serves as a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP's consistent and significant investment in R&D ($1.276 billion in fiscal 2024) and new technologies like generative AI, even as it focuses on margin improvement, demonstrates a long-range outlook. The company's strategy is built around long-term leadership in HCM technology and global scale, rather than short-term profit maximization. The 10-K states, "We are committed to building upon our past successes by investing in our business through enhancements in research and development and by driving meaningful transformation in the way we operate."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ADP has a strong financial position, generating $4.16 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2024. The company has a consistent history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends ($2.2 billion) and share repurchases ($1.2 billion) rather than issuing new shares for financing. As of June 30, 2024, the company had $2.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and a multi-billion dollar commercial paper program, indicating sufficient liquidity to fund operations and investments without dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K provides a detailed and transparent overview of its business, including a comprehensive "Risk Factors" section that outlines potential challenges in detail. These risks include cybersecurity threats, regulatory changes, and competition. This level of disclosure in its primary filing with the SEC suggests a culture of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K contains no disclosures of material legal proceedings that would question the integrity of management. The report from the independent auditor was unqualified, and the company has established an active AI & Data Ethics Committee to advise on the responsible use of new technologies. While a definitive judgment on integrity is difficult from financial filings alone, there are no red flags present in the provided documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/8670/000000867024000024/adp-20240630.htm'] (June 30, 2024)

---
**Synthesis**
ADP scores favorably across most of Fisher’s 15 points, reflecting its status as a mature, market-leading company with strong fundamentals. Its strongest positives are its vast market runway in the growing HCM space, deep competitive moat built on data and compliance expertise, robust profitability, and commitment to innovation through substantial R&D investments in areas like AI. The only "No" was due to a lack of specific evidence on executive relations, a point that would require the Proxy Statement to fully evaluate. The variables most likely to change this score in the next 12–24 months would be the market adoption and performance of its new generative AI products like ADP Assist, and its ability to maintain margin strength while continuing to invest heavily in technology to fend off agile, cloud-native competitors. A sustained increase in new business bookings and client retention would reaffirm the success of its sales and R&D efforts, while any sign of executive instability or a major data breach could negatively impact the score.

fisher score is 14 / 15
