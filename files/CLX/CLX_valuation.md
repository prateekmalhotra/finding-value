Excellent work on gathering the initial data and laying out a clear, methodical plan. A structured approach is crucial for a sound valuation.

Upon reviewing your analysis, I found that your framework is very strong, but there are a few critical calculation errors and questionable assumptions that, once corrected, will significantly improve the accuracy and defensibility of your valuation.

Below is a revised version of your analysis that corrects these issues while retaining your original structure and information. The key changes are highlighted in the rationale sections.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are embedded in the current stock price.

**Current Market Price**
As of August 22, 2025, the market price for The Clorox Company (CLX) is **$119.84** per share.

**Baseline Financials (TTM) - Revised**

The following table presents the corrected Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) financial data for the period ending March 31, 2025. Several original calculations contained arithmetic errors; these have been fixed to ensure an accurate baseline.

| Metric | Value (in millions) | Source / Calculation & Rationale for Correction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $7,031 | (FY2024 Revenue - 9mo ended Mar 2024 Revenue) + 9mo ended Mar 2025 Revenue = ($7,105M - $5,190M) + $5,116M = **$7,031M**. (Original calculation was $7,090M). |
| Gross Margin | 45.1% | TTM Gross Profit / TTM Revenue = $3,171M / $7,031M. (Adjusted based on corrected TTM Revenue). |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $965M | (FY2024 EBIT - 9mo ended Mar 2024 EBIT) + 9mo ended Mar 2025 EBIT = ($846M - $737M) + $856M = **$965M**. (Original value of $856M was just the latest 9-month figure, not the TTM). |
| Net Income | $697M | (FY2024 Net Income - 9mo ended Mar 2024 Net Income) + 9mo ended Mar 2025 Net Income = ($280M - $71M) + $488M = **$697M**. (Original calculation was incorrect). |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $211M | (FY2024 D&A - 9mo ended Mar 2024 D&A) + 9mo ended Mar 2025 D&A = ($225M - $176M) + $162M = **$211M**. (Minor correction for arithmetic consistency). |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $81M | FY2025 TTM Stock-Based Compensation (stockanalysis.com). |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | ($220M) | FY2025 TTM Capex (stockanalysis.com). |
| Change in Working Capital | ($211M) | FY2025 TTM Change in Working Capital (stockanalysis.com). |
| Interest Expense | $166M | TTM Interest Expense, calculated using the same TTM logic for consistency. (Using only 9 months of data understates the annual cost of debt). |
| Cash & Equivalents | $226M | As of March 31, 2025 (SEC Filing, March 31, 2025, p.4). |
| Total Debt | $2,850M | As of March 31, 2025. (Corrected to use the latest available balance sheet data, which is more relevant than the prior fiscal year-end figure). |
| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 124.5M | 9 months ended March 31, 2025 (SEC Filing, March 31, 2025, p.3). |

**Market-Implied Growth and Margin Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of $119.84, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model suggests the market is pricing in the following assumptions based on the corrected, higher TTM operating income:
*   **5-Year Revenue Growth (CAGR):** Approximately **2.5%**
*   **Operating Margin:** Stable at the TTM level of **13.7%** ($965M / $7,031M)

This implies that the market expects Clorox to grow slightly faster than its recent history while maintaining its current, improved profitability.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation**

This section presents a conservative, independent valuation based on a critical review of historical performance and more realistic forward-looking assumptions.

**Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **2.0% annually** | This assumption remains reasonable. It reflects a mature company in a slow-growing industry, a more cautious stance than the market's implied 2.5%. |
| **Operating Margin** | **15.0%** | This assumption remains reasonable, reflecting potential success from management's ongoing cost-saving initiatives and a slight improvement over the TTM margin. |
| **Tax Rate** | **24.0%** | This is the average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years, normalized for one-time events. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **3.5%** | Aligned with the 3-year historical average. |
| **Change in NWC as % of Revenue**| **1.0%** | **Correction:** Assuming a perpetual -3.0% is unsustainable as it implies an infinite source of cash from working capital. A more realistic assumption is a small *investment* (cash outflow) in working capital, such as 1.0% of revenue, to support growth. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **1.1%** | In line with the 3-year historical average. |
| **Net Share Count Reduction**| **-0.5% annually**| This assumption is for modeling purposes but the valuation will be based on current shares outstanding. |

**Free Cash Flow Build**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) calculation is corrected to properly account for non-cash charges.
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A + SBC - Capex - Change in NWC` **(Formula Corrected)**

| (in millions) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $7,172 | $7,315 | $7,461 | $7,611 | $7,763 |
| EBIT | $1,076 | $1,097 | $1,119 | $1,142 | $1,164 |
| FCFF | **$797** | **$813** | **$829** | **$846** | **$863** |

*FCFF is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.*

**Discount Rate (WACC) - Revised**

| Component | Value | Source / Calculation & Rationale for Correction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | **8.72%** | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Risk-Free Rate | 4.32% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 22, 2025). |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard market premium. |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beta | 0.88 | 3-year monthly beta. |
| **Cost of Debt** | **5.82%** | **Correction:** The cost of debt must be the company's current borrowing rate, which cannot be below the risk-free rate. Calculated as Risk-Free Rate (4.32%) + a 1.50% credit spread typical for a stable, investment-grade company like Clorox. |
| **WACC** | **7.88%** | **(E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-t)** = (14,920/17,770)*8.72% + (2,850/17,770)*5.82%*(1-0.24) = **7.88%**. (Recalculated with corrected Market Cap, Debt, and Cost of Debt). |

**Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   `Terminal Value = (FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($863 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0788 - 0.025) = $16,423M`
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** The Gordon Growth terminal value implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of **10.8x**, which is a reasonable and defensible multiple for a mature consumer staples company.

**Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Present Value of 5-Year FCFF | $3,375 |
| Present Value of Terminal Value | $11,213 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$14,588** |
| Less: Total Debt | ($2,850) |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents | $226 |
| **Equity Value** | **$11,964** |

**Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:** **$96.10** (`$11,964M / 124.5M current diluted shares`)

| Case | Assumptions | Fair Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | 2.0% growth, 15.0% margin | **$96.10** |
| **Low/Bear Case**| 1.0% growth, 14.0% margin | **$81.55** |
| **High/Bull Case**| 3.0% growth, 16.0% margin | **$113.81** |

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** **$67.27** (`$96.10 * (1 - 0.30)`)

**Risk Notes**

1.  **Input Cost Volatility:** The company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices, which could compress margins if not offset by pricing actions.
2.  **Competition:** Intense competition from both branded and private-label products could limit pricing power and market share.
3.  **Consumer Demand:** A significant portion of Clorox's products are tied to cleaning and disinfecting trends, which may not be as strong as they were during the pandemic.
4.  **Brand Relevance:** The company must continue to innovate and invest in its brands to maintain relevance with evolving consumer preferences.
5.  **Execution Risk:** The success of cost-saving and digital transformation initiatives is not guaranteed and failure to execute could negatively impact profitability.

final answer is 96.10 $
