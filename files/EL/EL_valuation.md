### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in NWC - SBC`

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1 (2026)** | **Year 2 (2027)** | **Year 3 (2028)** | **Year 4 (2029)** | **Year 5 (2030)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | **$14,827** | **$15,309** | **$15,768** | **$16,202** | **$16,607** |
| _Growth Rate_ | _3.50%_ | _3.25%_ | _3.00%_ | _2.75%_ | _2.50%_ |
| **EBIT** | **$1,260** | **$1,378** | **$1,498** | **$1,620** | **$1,744** |
| _Operating Margin_ | _8.50%_ | _9.00%_ | _9.50%_ | _10.00%_ | _10.50%_ |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Formula: `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   Inputs:
        *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.28% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 20, 2025).
        *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (standard assumption).
        *   Beta: 1.18 (5-Year Monthly Beta).
    *   `Cost of Equity = 4.28% + 1.18 * 5.0% = 10.18%`
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-tax Cost of Debt (Interest Expense / Total Debt) = 3.77%
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.77% * (1 - 25%) = 2.83%
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Formula: `WACC = (E/V * CoE) + (D/V * CoD * (1-T))`
    *   Market Cap (E): $31,165M
    *   Total Debt (D): $9,467M
    *   `WACC = (76.7% * 10.18%) + (23.3% * 2.83%) = 8.47%`
    *   **Discount Rate Used: 8.5%**

---

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate (g) of 2.5% is used, reflecting the long-term inflation expectation.
    *   Formula: `Terminal Value = (FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   `Terminal Value = ($833M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.085 - 0.025) = $14,228M`
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $1,744M + $955M = $2,699M
    *   A conservative 10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple of 15.0x is assumed.
    *   `Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $2,699M * 15.0 = $40,485M`
    *   Given the significant discrepancy, the more conservative **Gordon Growth method is used for the base-case valuation.**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   `Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $5,708M / 360M = $15.86`
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $15.86. Assumes 3.5% initial growth fading to 2.5%, and margin recovery to 10.0%.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** $10.50. Assumes 1.5% initial growth and no margin recovery (stable at ~7.9%).
    *   **High/Bull Case:** $22.75. Assumes 5.0% initial growth and faster margin recovery to 11.0%.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount is applied to the base-case fair value.
    *   `MOS Price = $15.86 * (1 - 0.30) = $11.10`

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Margin Pressure:** The company's operating margin has significantly compressed. A failure to restore profitability closer to historical levels would negatively impact valuation.
2.  **Competition:** The beauty and cosmetics industry is highly competitive. Increased competition could pressure growth and margins.
3.  **Consumer Spending:** As a premium consumer discretionary brand, Estée Lauder is susceptible to downturns in global consumer spending.
4.  **Geopolitical Risk:** Significant exposure to international markets, particularly in Asia, presents risks related to trade, regulation, and currency fluctuations.
5.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation's assumed margin recovery is dependent on successful execution of management's strategy; any missteps could hinder this.

final answer is 15.86 $
