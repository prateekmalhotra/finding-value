### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Management guided for "constant currency revenue growth of 20%" for the fiscal year 2024. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, May 15, 2025)
*   **Margin Targets:** Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be "slightly above the prior year's level of 30.1%." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, May 15, 2025)
*   **Capex Outlook:** No specific quantitative guidance was provided.

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Year 1:** We will use the management guidance of **20% growth**.
    *   **Years 2-5:** We will decelerate this growth by 2% annually, assuming a gradual normalization. This reflects a blend of strong current momentum with the law of large numbers. (20%, 18%, 16%, 14%, 12%)
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   The TTM EBIT margin is 26.7%. We will conservatively hold the **EBIT margin stable at 26.5%** through the forecast period, slightly below the TTM level to account for potential growth investments.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   The 3-year average effective tax rate is approximately 37%. The TTM rate is 31.3%. We will use a normalized **effective tax rate of 32%**.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** The 3-year average Capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 5.8%. We will use a slightly lower **4.5% of revenue**, reflecting the completion of major capacity expansion projects.
    *   **Working Capital:** The TTM change in working capital was 7.0% of revenue. We will model this as **6.0% of incremental revenue** going forward, assuming improved efficiency.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-based compensation is not explicitly broken out in the provided cash flow statement, so it will be omitted from the FCFF calculation. This is a conservative choice that may slightly understate cash flows.
    *   The final share count used for valuation will be the latest available: **187.0 million**.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions €) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 2,432.4 | 2,870.2 | 3,329.5 | 3,795.6 | 4,251.1 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *20.0%* | *18.0%* | *16.0%* | *14.0%* | *12.0%* |
| EBIT (26.5% margin) | 644.6 | 760.6 | 882.3 | 1,005.8 | 1,126.5 |
| Tax (32%) | (206.3) | (243.4) | (282.3) | (321.9) | (360.5) |
| **NOPAT** | **438.3** | **517.2** | **600.0** | **684.0** | **766.0** |
| D&A (5.5% of Rev) | 133.8 | 157.9 | 183.1 | 208.8 | 233.8 |
| Capex (4.5% of Rev) | (109.5) | (129.2) | (149.8) | (170.8) | (191.3) |
| Change in WC (6% of RevΔ) | (24.3) | (26.3) | (27.6) | (28.0) | (27.3) |
| **FCFF** | **438.3** | **520.0** | **605.7** | **694.0** | **781.2** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 2.5% (Approximate current 10-year German Bund yield).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.5% (Standard assumption for a developed European market).
    *   **Beta:** 1.10. A beta slightly above 1.0 reflects the company's exposure to discretionary consumer spending, which is cyclical in nature.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 2.5% + 1.10 * 5.5% = 8.55%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = €124.5M / €1,368.0M = 9.1%. We use a pre-tax cost of debt of **5.0%** assuming current rates are lower than the historical average.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.0% * (1 - 0.32) = 3.4%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Cap (Equity Value) = 187.0M shares * €50.08/share = €9,365M
    *   Value of Debt = €1,368.0M
    *   Total Capital = €10,733M
    *   **WACC = (9365/10733) * 8.55% + (1368/10733) * 3.4% = 7.46% + 0.43% = 7.89%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate `g` of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term sustainable global inflation and economic growth.
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (€781.2 * 1.025) / (7.89% - 2.5%) = €14,845M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = €1,126.5M + €233.8M = €1,360.3M.
    *   A conservative 10x EV/EBITDA multiple is assumed for a mature company in this sector.
    *   **Terminal Value (Multiple) = 10 * €1,360.3M = €13,603M.**
    *   The Exit Multiple method results in a lower terminal value, which we will use for our base case as a conservative measure.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   PV of Explicit FCFF = (€438.3/1.0789) + (€520.0/1.0789^2) + (€605.7/1.0789^3) + (€694.0/1.0789^4) + (€781.2/1.0789^5) = €2,367M
*   PV of Terminal Value = €13,603M / (1.0789^5) = €9,286M
*   **Enterprise Value = €2,367M + €9,286M = €11,653M**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt (€1,368.0M) - Cash (€261.8M) = €1,106.2M
    *   **Equity Value = €11,653M - €1,106.2M = €10,546.8M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = €10,546.8M / 187.0M = €56.40**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: €56.40.** Assumes 20% growth decelerating to 12% and stable 26.5% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: €42.00.** Assumes lower growth (15% decelerating to 8%) and margin compression to 24%, resulting in a lower valuation.
    *   **High/Bull Case: €75.00.** Assumes sustained high growth (22% decelerating to 15%) and margin expansion to 28.5% on operating leverage.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for estimation errors.
    *   **MOS Price = €56.40 * (1 - 0.25) = €42.30**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Fashion Risk:** Birkenstock's recent success is tied to strong brand momentum. A shift in consumer preferences represents a significant risk to future growth.
2.  **Competition:** The footwear market is highly competitive. Increased competition from both established players and new entrants could pressure pricing and margins.
3.  **Economic Sensitivity:** As a premium consumer product, sales are susceptible to downturns in discretionary spending during economic recessions.
4.  **Supply Chain & Production:** Disruptions in the supply chain or an inability to scale production to meet demand could hamper revenue growth.
5.  **Foreign Exchange:** As a European company reporting in Euros with significant global sales, currency fluctuations can impact reported earnings and margins.
