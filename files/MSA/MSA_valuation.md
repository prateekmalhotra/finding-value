### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **Y1: 4.0%**, blending the midpoint of "low single-digit" (2%) organic growth with 2% from acquisitions. **Years 2-5: Tapering from 3.5% down to 2.5%** to reflect a mature, stable growth rate. | Alpha Spread Q2'25 Commentary |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **22.8%**, held flat from the TTM level. While the 3-year average is lower, recent performance is stronger. No specific margin expansion initiatives were cited, so a stable margin is assumed. | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 4, 2025 |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **24.3%**, based on the TTM rate and the average of the last two non-anomalous fiscal years (2024 and 2022). | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 4, 2025 |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **3.8%**, based on the TTM capital intensity. This is more conservative than the 3-year average. | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 4, 2025 |
| **Change in WC** | **30.4% of incremental revenue**, based on the 4-year historical average of Working Capital as a percentage of Revenue. | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 4, 2025 |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in millions USD) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | **9.05%** | `Formula: Risk-Free Rate + Beta * ERP` |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.30% | Current 10-Yr U.S. Treasury Yield (YCharts, Aug 19, 2025) |
| Beta (5Y Monthly) | 0.95 | Reflects slightly lower volatility than the market average, suitable for a mature industrial firm. (Yahoo Finance) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| **Cost of Debt (After-Tax)**| **3.28%**| `Formula: (Interest Expense / Total Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate)` |
| **WACC** | **8.5%** | `Formula: (E/V * Cost of Equity) + (D/V * Cost of Debt * (1-T))` |
| *Equity Weight* | *90.2%* | Market Cap of $6,672M (Yahoo Finance) |
| *Debt Weight* | *9.8%* | Total Debt of $725.9M (StockAnalysis.com) |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Calculation | Result (USD millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth** | `(Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`<br>`($334.7 * (1 + 2.5%)) / (8.5% - 2.5%)` | **$5,720** |
| *Assumptions* | `g` = 2.5% (long-term inflation proxy), `WACC` = 8.5% | |
| **Exit Multiple (Cross-Check)** | TTM EBITDA ($482.6M) grown at revenue rates for 5 years = $578M.<br>`Year 5 EBITDA * Median Multiple`<br>`$578M * 15.6x` | **$9,017** |
| *Assumptions* | Year 5 EBITDA of $578M, Multiple of 15.6x (Yahoo Finance) | |

The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value and is therefore used in the base case.

| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price** | `Base Case * (1 - 30%)`<br>`$113.90 * 0.70` | **$79.73** |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Margin Pressure:** Recent results indicated margin erosion due to FX and inflation. The model assumes stable margins, but continued pressure could lead to lower-than-projected cash flows.
2.  **Industrial Cyclicality:** Demand for MSA's products is tied to industrial and energy markets, which can be cyclical. A broader economic downturn could reduce capital spending by customers and negatively impact revenue.
3.  **Acquisition Integration:** The valuation incorporates growth from the recent M&C TechGroup acquisition. Failure to successfully integrate the business or realize expected synergies poses a risk to the forecast.
4.  **Input Cost Inflation:** As a manufacturer, MSA is exposed to fluctuations in raw material and labor costs, which could further impact profitability if not offset by price increases.

final answer is 113.90 $
