Company: GoPro, Inc. (GPRO)
Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K, 10-Q), Earnings Call Transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's core action camera market is mature and highly competitive. While the company has expanded into software with its Quik app and a subscription service, these are still a small portion of overall revenue. The company's 2024 10-K filing notes that their "addressable market may not grow and may even contract." Growth depends on innovation and expansion into new categories, but the long-term runway for a sizable increase in sales is not guaranteed.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro consistently invests in research and development to bring new cameras and accessories to market. The company's 2024 10-K states that they "are focused on developing new products and services and enhancing our existing products and services." They have also expanded into software and subscriptions, indicating a commitment to finding new avenues for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, GoPro spent approximately $135 million on R&D, which represented about 13% of its revenue. While this is a significant investment, the company has struggled to consistently translate this spending into profitable growth. New product releases are often iterative improvements on existing models rather than groundbreaking innovations that expand the market.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro has a well-established global distribution network that includes major retailers. The company has also been successful in driving direct-to-consumer sales through its website. However, the company is heavily reliant on a small number of large retailers, which creates concentration risk. The 2024 10-K indicates that "a limited number of our retailers and distributors account for a substantial portion of our revenue."
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's profit margins have been inconsistent and under pressure. The company reported a gross margin of 33.4% in 2024, which was down from 37.6% in 2023. The company has also reported net losses in recent years, indicating that it is not consistently profitable.
**Answer:** No

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro is focused on a direct-to-consumer strategy, which has the potential to improve margins. The company has also implemented cost-cutting measures. In their Q4 2024 earnings call, management discussed their focus on "disciplined opex management." However, the impact of these initiatives on long-term margin improvement remains to be seen.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no widespread reports of significant labor issues or employee dissatisfaction at GoPro. The company's 2024 10-K does not mention any significant labor disputes. However, the company has undergone multiple rounds of layoffs in recent years, which can negatively impact employee morale.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Nicholas Woodman has been the CEO of GoPro since he founded the company in 2002. While this provides stability, there has been some turnover in other executive positions. The company's proxy statement provides information on executive compensation and insider ownership, but there is not enough information to definitively say that executive relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's management team is relatively small, and the company is heavily reliant on its founder and CEO, Nicholas Woodman. The 2024 10-K acknowledges that the loss of key personnel, including Mr. Woodman, could have a material adverse effect on the company.
**Answer:** No

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, and the company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls. The 10-K provides a detailed breakdown of costs, but the company's ability to accurately forecast demand and manage inventory has been a challenge in the past.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro has strong brand recognition and a loyal following in the action camera market. The company has also built a valuable ecosystem of mounts, accessories, and software. However, the industry is characterized by intense competition from both established players and new entrants, including smartphone manufacturers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro has been focused on returning to profitability in the short-term, which has sometimes come at the expense of long-term growth initiatives. The company's guidance and commentary on earnings calls often emphasize near-term financial targets.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, GoPro had a solid cash position and no long-term debt. The company has been generating positive cash flow from operations. This strong financial position should allow the company to fund its growth initiatives without the need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** GoPro's management team regularly communicates with investors through earnings calls and presentations. They are generally transparent about the company's performance, both good and bad. However, some analysts have criticized the company for not providing enough detail on its future product roadmap.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There have been no major legal or ethical scandals involving GoPro's management team. The company has a code of conduct and appears to be committed to good corporate governance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

---
Synthesis: GoPro's strongest positive attributes are its commitment to ongoing development, its solid financial position, and its transparent communication with investors. The company also has good cost analysis and accounting controls. However, GoPro faces significant challenges, including a mature core market, inconsistent profitability, and a heavy reliance on its founder and CEO. The score is unlikely to change significantly in the next 12-24 months unless the company can successfully launch a new product that expands its addressable market or demonstrates a sustained improvement in profitability. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" for "Worthwhile Profit Margins" with several quarters of consistent profitability.

fisher score is 6 / 15
