### **4) Forecast & Assumptions**
The following assumptions are for a 5-year forecast horizon (Year 1 = 2026).

| Assumption | Value/Method | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | 1.0% annually | This uses the most conservative end of the "low single-digit" guidance, reflecting cautious consumer sentiment. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 1, 2025) |
| **Operating Margin** | 21.1% (flat) | Consistent with TTM margin and conservative due to the lack of specific, cited drivers for margin expansion. (stockanalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| **Tax Rate** | 22.5% | Reflects the TTM effective tax rate, a reasonable proxy for future obligations. (stockanalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 3.0% | Directly from management guidance. (Q1 2025 10-Q, Apr 25, 2025) |
| **D&A Growth** | 1.0% annually | D&A is assumed to grow slowly from its TTM base, slightly below the rate of capex. (stockanalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| **Change in NWC** | 1.0% of Revenue | A conservative plug, assuming working capital is a use of cash, consistent with instructions for volatile historical trends. |
| **SBC Treatment** | Subtracted from FCF | Stock-based compensation is treated as a real cash expense in the FCFF calculation. |

### **5) Free Cash Flow Build**
The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) - Stock-Based Comp + D&A - Capex - Change in NWC**

*(All figures in USD Millions)*
| Year | 2026 (Y1) | 2027 (Y2) | 2028 (Y3) | 2029 (Y4) | 2030 (Y5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 20,198 | 20,400 | 20,604 | 20,810 | 21,018 |
| **EBIT** | 4,262 | 4,304 | 4,347 | 4,391 | 4,435 |
| EBIT * (1-Tax Rate) | 3,303 | 3,336 | 3,369 | 3,403 | 3,437 |
| - Stock-Based Comp | (148) | (150) | (151) | (153) | (154) |
| + D&A | 603 | 609 | 615 | 621 | 627 |
| - Capex | (606) | (612) | (618) | (624) | (631) |
| - Change in NWC | (202) | (204) | (206) | (208) | (210) |
| **FCFF** | **2,950** | **2,979** | **3,009** | **3,039** | **3,069** |

### **6) Discount Rate (WACC)**
| Component | Value | Formula/Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.30% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (YCharts, Aug 19, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 6.50% | Conservative estimate as per instructions. |
| Beta (β) | 1.00 | Conservative assumption. |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **10.80%** | `Rf + β * ERP` |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt (Kd) | 5.50% | Conservative estimate reflecting current credit market conditions. |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 4.26% | `Kd * (1 - Tax Rate)` |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | 69,530 | $85/share * 818M shares (stockanalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | 8,758 | Total Debt (stockanalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| **WACC** | **10.1%** | `(E/(E+D) * Ke) + (D/(E+D) * Kd * (1-T))` |

### **7) Terminal Value**
*   **Method:** Gordon Growth Model
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a conservative rate, assuming long-term growth in line with a modest inflation proxy and below the risk-free rate.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Terminal FCFF (Y6) = FCFF Y5 * (1 + g) = $3,069M * (1.025) = $3,146M
    *   **Terminal Value** = Terminal FCFF / (WACC - g) = $3,146M / (10.1% - 2.5%) = **$41,395M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Terminal Value implies an exit multiple on Year 5 EBIT of $41,395M / $4,435M = **9.3x**. This is a conservative multiple for a stable consumer staples company, providing confidence in the terminal value assumption.

### **8) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
*(All figures in USD Millions)*
| Component | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) | 11,374 |
| PV of Terminal Value | 25,699 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **37,073** |
| (-) Total Debt | (8,758) |
| (+) Cash & S-T Investments | 1,412 |
| **Net Debt** | **(7,346)** |
| (-) Minority Interest | (350) |
| **Equity Value** | **29,377** |

### **9) Per-Share Valuation**
| Metric | Value | Formula/Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Equity Value | 29,377 | USD Millions |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 818 | Millions (stockanalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| **Base Intrinsic Value/Share** | **$35.91** | `Equity Value / Diluted Shares` |
| **Low Intrinsic Value/Share** | **$32.32** | 10% discount to base case |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price** | **$22.62** | 30% below Low estimate |

Given the single-point guidance, a range is derived by applying a discount to the base case. The analysis produces a conservative base-case value significantly below recent trading prices.

### **10) Risk Notes**
1.  **Margin Pressure:** The model assumes flat operating margins. Continued inflation in raw materials, packaging, and logistics, along with tariff impacts, could lead to margin compression if cost savings and price increases do not fully offset them.
2.  **Consumer Behavior:** The valuation is sensitive to the 1.0% revenue growth assumption. A prolonged period of cautious consumer spending, particularly in North America, or market share losses to private label brands could result in flat or negative growth, reducing the intrinsic value.
3.  **Foreign Exchange:** With ~66% of sales outside the U.S., the company has significant exposure to currency fluctuations. A strengthening USD would negatively impact reported earnings and cash flows beyond the model's simplified assumptions.

final answer is 35.91 $
