Company: Allison Transmission Holdings, Inc. (ALSN)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024; Q4 2024 Earnings Release (February 11, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission has two primary growth avenues. First, the company is the dominant player in fully-automatic transmissions for commercial vehicles in North America, but manual transmissions still prevail in many international markets; increasing the adoption rate of automatic transmissions outside North America presents a significant, long-term growth opportunity. Second, Allison is actively investing in and launching next-generation propulsion solutions, including its "eGen" portfolio of electric hybrid and fully electric axles, to compete in the market for alternative energy commercial vehicles. This dual strategy of penetrating existing markets and innovating for new ones provides a long runway for sales growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison's management demonstrates a clear commitment to future growth through consistent investment in research and development, with a stated focus on expanding its portfolio of electric hybrid and fully electric propulsion solutions. Engineering and R&D expenses rose to $200 million in 2024 from $194 million in 2023, funding new product initiatives. This investment addresses the primary technological shift in the industry and positions Allison to capture sales from the transition to electric vehicles, ensuring relevance beyond its current product lines.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Allison spent $200 million on R&D, representing 6.2% of its $3.225 billion in net sales. This level of investment is significant when compared to larger competitors like Eaton (3.2% of revenue) and Dana Inc. (2.2% of revenue), and slightly below technology-focused ZF (8.7%). Given Allison's market leadership in its core niche and its focused development of the eGen Power and eGen Flex platforms for the EV transition, its R&D spending appears effective and appropriately scaled to defend its current business and invest in the future.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison maintains a robust, multi-channel sales organization that effectively creates demand. The company sells directly to large OEM customers, with whom it secures multi-year long-term agreements (LTAs) that covered over 90% of its North American on-highway unit volume in 2024. Crucially, it complements this with a "pull-through" marketing strategy that targets end-users directly, educating them on the benefits of Allison products to generate specific requests at the point of vehicle purchase. This is supported by a global network of approximately 1,600 independent distributor and dealer locations for sales and service.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison's profit margins are exceptionally strong and well above its peers, indicating significant competitive advantages. For the full year 2024, the company reported a gross margin of 47.4% and an operating margin of 30.8%. These figures are substantially higher than those of key competitors like Eaton (24.0% segment margin) and Dana Inc. (2.2% operating margin, 8.6% adjusted EBITDA margin). Such high margins demonstrate strong pricing power, brand value, and efficient operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm (February 13, 2025), https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us/company/news-insights/news-releases/2025/eaton-reports-record-fourth-quarter-2024-results.html (January 31, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to protect its high margins. The primary lever for margin maintenance has been pricing power; in 2024, gross profit was positively impacted by "$80 million of price increases on certain products." The company also focuses on operational efficiency to control costs within its manufacturing footprint. While gross margin percentage dipped slightly in 2024 due to higher manufacturing expenses including a one-time union signing bonus, the ability to consistently pass through price increases is a key tool for maintaining its superior margin profile.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison appears to have stable and constructive labor relations. In January 2024, the company entered into a new four-year collective bargaining agreement with the UAW Local 933, which represents approximately 50% of its U.S. employees. Successfully negotiating a long-term agreement without significant operational disruption is a positive indicator. The company's 2024 10-K notes, "In general, we consider our labor relations with all of our employees to be good." There is no recent evidence of widespread disputes or strikes.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a history of working together. Key leaders have been with the company for extended periods, suggesting a cohesive team. The company's definitive proxy statements outline compensation programs that align executive incentives with performance metrics such as operating income and cash flow, creating a strong link between management pay and shareholder interests. There is no evidence of public disputes or high-profile turnover at the executive level.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison's investor relations website and annual filings list a full slate of executive officers beyond the CEO, covering key functions like operations, finance, marketing, and engineering. The company has leaders for its various end-markets, indicating decentralized operational responsibility. The company has a succession plan in place and has demonstrated this with smooth transitions in senior leadership roles in recent years. This suggests a professional, non-autocratic management structure with sufficient depth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial reporting appears robust and transparent. The independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. The 10-K report confirms that management's assessment found internal controls to be effective, with no material weaknesses identified. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison's key competitive advantage lies in its singular focus and brand reputation for quality and reliability in fully automatic transmissions, a critical component where failure leads to significant vehicle downtime and cost for end-users. Unlike more diversified competitors, Allison is a specialist. This focus has created a powerful brand that allows it to command premium pricing, as evidenced by its superior margins. Furthermore, its extensive global service and support network of ~1,600 locations is a significant barrier to entry and a key factor in purchasing decisions for global fleets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a balanced approach, delivering strong current profitability while investing for the long term. The consistent and increasing R&D spending, particularly on electrification (eGen platform), shows a willingness to invest ahead of mass adoption to secure future market share. In public communications, executives consistently highlight the long-term growth opportunities in international markets and vehicle electrification, framing current investments as necessary for future returns rather than focusing solely on quarterly EPS. This commitment to funding future growth platforms, even at the cost of near-term margin points, indicates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison's financial position is very strong, eliminating the need for dilutive equity financing. The company is a powerful cash generator, producing $801 million in net cash from operating activities in 2024. Rather than issuing shares, management is aggressively returning capital to shareholders. In 2024, the company spent $254 million on share repurchases and $87 million on dividends, demonstrating significant financial strength and a commitment to reducing share count, not increasing it.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently discusses both opportunities and challenges in its public filings and investor communications. The "Risk Factors" section of the 10-K is detailed and highlights specific threats, such as the competition from vertically integrated OEMs and the risk of slow adoption of automatic transmissions internationally. In the MD&A section, the company provides clear explanations for segment-level performance, attributing a 37% decline in Global Off-Highway sales in 2024 to lower demand in specific sectors rather than obscuring the issue. This transparency suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm (February 13, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant integrity issues with Allison's management. A review of legal proceedings in the 10-K indicates only routine claims arising from the normal course of business. The company has an independent auditor, a formal code of conduct, and a corporate governance structure appropriate for a company of its size. There are no recent or pending material lawsuits, SEC investigations, or scandals related to executive conduct that would call their integrity into question.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Allison Transmission scores perfectly across Fisher's 15 points, painting a picture of a high-quality, durable business. The company's strongest attributes are its dominant market position, which translates into exceptionally high profit margins, and its robust financial health, enabling significant and consistent capital returns to shareholders. The management team appears to be prudently balancing near-term execution with long-term strategic investment in electrification. The most critical variable that could change this score in the next 12-24 months is the pace of EV adoption in the commercial vehicle market. A rapid, disruptive shift could challenge Allison's R&D effectiveness and product runway if competitors' EV solutions gain superior market traction. To maintain its perfect score, evidence must continue to show successful commercialization and order wins for its eGen platform, demonstrating that its R&D is effectively translating into next-generation market share.

fisher score is 15 / 15
