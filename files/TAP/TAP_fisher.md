**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Molson Coors' management has demonstrated a clear commitment to innovation and portfolio diversification. Recent earnings calls and investor presentations have consistently highlighted the introduction of new products, such as Simply Spiked Lemonade, and the expansion of successful brands like Madri into new markets.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Molson Coors does not disclose its Research & Development expenses as a separate line item in its financial statements, which makes a quantitative assessment of its R&D effectiveness relative to its size and peers challenging. While the company has successfully launched new products, the lack of specific data on R&D spending and its correlation to new product success prevents a definitive affirmative answer.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's public statements and strategic decisions indicate a focus on long-term value creation.

Synthesis:
Molson Coors demonstrates a strong alignment with many of Philip A. Fisher's "15 Points," reflecting a well-managed company with a clear strategy and solid financial footing. The company's primary strengths are its commitment to innovation, effective sales organization, and healthy financials. The most significant areas for improvement are its labor relations, as evidenced by a recent strike, and the lack of transparency in its R&D spending. Over the next 12 to 24 months, the company's score is most likely to be influenced by its ability to continue to successfully execute its "beyond beer" strategy and the outcome of its efforts to improve relations with its workforce. A sustained period of labor stability and a move to disclose R&D metrics would be key to improving its score.

fisher score is 13 / 15
