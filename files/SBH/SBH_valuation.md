**B) Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of $13.38 per share, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.5%**, assuming the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) operating margin of 9.01% is sustained indefinitely. This valuation is derived using a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model with an 8.71% Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and a 2.5% terminal growth rate. This level of growth is required to support the current valuation.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation**

**C) Forecast & Assumptions (Conservative Base-Case)**

Here I formulate a set of conservative, evidence-based assumptions that deviate from the market's implied expectations.

| Assumption | Market-Implied | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (5-Yr CAGR)** | 2.5% | **0.5%** | The market's implied growth is optimistic compared to the TTM revenue decline of -0.38% and the 3-year revenue CAGR of -1.35%. A 0.5% growth rate assumes successful stabilization but reflects a more conservative outlook on future growth. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Operating Margin** | 9.01% (Stable) | **9.0%** | In the absence of management guidance, the 3-year average operating margin (9.0%) is used, which is in line with the TTM margin. No margin expansion is assumed without specific company initiatives. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Tax Rate** | 26.2% (TTM) | **26.0%** | This is based on the 3-year average effective tax rate (25.7%), providing a normalized rate. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Capex (% of Revenue)** | 2.6% (TTM) | **2.6%** | This aligns with the 3-year historical average, suggesting capital intensity will remain consistent with recent history. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **D&A (% of Revenue)** | 2.76% (TTM) | **2.76%** | Based on TTM D&A of $101.8M and TTM Revenue of $3,689M ($101.8M / $3,689M = 2.76%), assuming D&A scales with revenue. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **SBC (% of Revenue)** | 0.5% (TTM) | **0.5%** | Stock-based compensation (SBC) is typically a non-cash expense. It is assumed to remain stable relative to revenue and will be added back in the FCFF calculation. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025) |
| **Share Count Change** | (Not specified) | **-1.5% annually** | Reflects historical buyback activity and management's authorization. The company repurchased 1.8 million shares in the six months to March 31, 2025, and the diluted share count has historically decreased by ~1.4% annually. (Form 10-Q, May 5, 2025) |

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Revised Formula:** FCFF = NOPAT + D&A - Capex + Stock-Based Compensation - Change in Working Capital
*(Note: Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is typically a non-cash expense included in EBIT/NOPAT, so it is added back to arrive at true cash flow. The prior calculation incorrectly subtracted it, which would be double-counting if it were also an explicit cash outflow.)*

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,707 | $3,726 | $3,745 | $3,763 | $3,782 |
| EBIT (9.0% Margin) | $333.7 | $335.3 | $337.0 | $338.7 | $340.4 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-26%)) | $246.9 | $248.2 | $249.4 | $250.6 | $251.9 |
| (+) D&A (2.76% of Rev) | $102.3 | $102.8 | $103.4 | $103.9 | $104.5 |
| (-) Capex (2.6% of Rev) | ($96.4) | ($96.9) | ($97.4) | ($97.9) | ($98.3) |
| (+) Stock-Based Comp (0.5% of Rev) | $18.5 | $18.6 | $18.7 | $18.8 | $18.9 |
| (-) Change in WC | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)**| **$271.3** | **$272.7** | **$274.1** | **$275.4**| **$276.9** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Market Value of Equity (MVE):** 105.0M shares * $13.38/share = $1,404.9M
*   **Market Value of Debt (MVD):** $906.8M
*   **Total Capital:** $1,404.9M + $906.8M = $2,311.7M

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** 10.79% = 4.29% (10-Yr Treasury) + 1.30 (Beta) \* 5.0% (ERP)
*   **Cost of Debt (After-Tax):** 5.49% = ($67.3M / $906.8M) * (1 - 26.0%)
*   **WACC:** 8.71% = ($1,404.9M / $2,311.7M * 10.79%) + ($906.8M / $2,311.7M * 5.49%)

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Value = (276.9 * 1.025) / (8.71% - 2.5%) = 283.82 / 0.0621 = **$4,570M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $340.4M + $104.5M = $444.9M
    *   The Gordon Growth terminal value of $4,570M implies an exit EV/EBITDA multiple of **10.27x** ($4,570M / $444.9M). This is a realistic multiple for a stable retail business and is in line with or slightly above the user-suggested 10x, making it a reasonable cross-check. The Gordon Growth method will be used.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Calculation | Value (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of 5-Year FCFF | $1,063 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $2,999 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$4,062** |
| (-) Total Debt | ($906.8) |
| (+) Cash & Equivalents | $92.2 |
| **Equity Value** | **$3,247.4** |

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Year 5 Share Count:** 97.3M (starting from 105.0M with a 1.5% annual reduction)
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:** $3,247.4M / 97.3M shares = **$33.38**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$33.38**. Assumes 0.5% revenue growth and stable 9.0% operating margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$25.64**. This represents a 23.2% discount from the base case, reflecting assumptions of -1.0% revenue decline and margin compression to 8.0%.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$41.69**. This represents a 24.9% premium over the base case, reflecting assumptions of 1.5% revenue growth and modest margin expansion to 9.5%.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a target purchase price.
    *   MOS Price = $33.38 * (1 - 0.30) = **$23.37**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competitive Pressure:** The beauty retail market is highly competitive, with pressure from online retailers and larger specialty stores like Ulta and Sephora, which could hinder revenue growth and compress margins.
2.  **Consumer Spending:** As a retailer of discretionary goods, SBH is sensitive to downturns in consumer spending, which could result from inflation or economic weakness.
3.  **Inventory Management:** Failure to manage inventory effectively could lead to markdowns and reduced profitability, a key risk in the retail sector.
4.  **Debt Burden:** The company maintains a significant debt load, and rising interest rates or failure to generate sufficient cash flow could strain its ability to service its debt.

final answer is 33.38 $
