Of course. I have reviewed the provided valuation analysis of Darling Ingredients Inc. (DAR). While the structure and methodology are sound, there are several areas where the assumptions can be refined to better reflect the company's operational reality and produce a more robust valuation. The primary issues identified are the simplified relationship between Capex and D&A, and a potentially conservative terminal value calculation.

Below is a revised valuation that addresses these points, maintaining the original format and information while incorporating more nuanced assumptions.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$34.82** (as of close, August 22, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM - Trailing Twelve Months ended June 28, 2025):**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,702.0 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Gross Margin | 22.88% | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $317.6 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Net Income | $105.4 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $496.6 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $20.9 | StockAnalysis.com, FY2024, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | $274.7 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Change in Working Capital | $14.8 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Interest Expense | $231.6 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Cash & Equivalents | $94.6 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Total Debt | $4,217.0 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 160.0 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025 |

*Note on SBC: The TTM SBC value was negative (-$1.02M), which is likely a data artifact. The FY 2024 value of $20.9M is used as a more representative baseline.*

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the market price of $34.82, we must solve for the assumptions that bridge our DCF model to the current enterprise value of **$9,693.6M** (Market Cap of $5,571.2M + Debt of $4,217.0M - Cash of $94.6M).

*   **WACC:** 7.83% (details in Part 2)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

Holding the TTM operating margin of **5.57%** constant, the model requires a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 14.5%** to arrive at the current market price.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify today's stock price of $34.82, an investor must believe that Darling Ingredients can grow its revenue at approximately **14.5% annually for the next five years** while maintaining its current operating margin of 5.57%. This represents a significant turnaround from recent performance.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Balanced Base-Case)**

This section builds an intrinsic value estimate from a balanced, evidence-based standpoint, correcting for oversimplifications in the initial analysis.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

*   **Revenue Growth:** The market's 14.5% implied growth is highly optimistic. A conservative view might understate the recovery potential of a cyclical business. A balanced approach reflects a modest recovery from the "challenging" environment noted on the earnings call, followed by normalization.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Revenue growth of **3.0% in Year 1**, accelerating to **5.0% in Year 2** as conditions improve, then tapering to a long-term stable rate of **3.5% by Year 5**. This provides a more realistic growth cycle.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM margin of 5.57% is depressed. The 3-year average is 8.28%. Assuming a partial recovery that accounts for persistent pressure in the fuel segment is prudent.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Operating Margin expands from the TTM low and stabilizes at **8.0%**, slightly below the 3-year average but reflecting improved operational efficiency in the core business.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** A normalized tax rate of **15.0%**, consistent with the historical average.
*   **Capital Intensity (Revised Logic):** The original model incorrectly assumed Capex and D&A would move in lockstep as a percentage of revenue. TTM data shows D&A ($496.6M) significantly exceeds Capex ($274.7M), meaning free cash flow is currently benefiting from lower reinvestment. This relationship is modeled more realistically.
    *   **D&A:** D&A relates to the existing asset base.
        *   **Analyst's Assumption:** D&A starts at the TTM level of **$496.6M** and grows by **1.5% annually**, reflecting depreciation from new, modest capital investments.
    *   **Capex:** Capex is required for maintenance and growth. The 3-year average is 6.5% of sales.
        *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Capex is set to **5.5% of annual revenue**, reflecting a balance between growth investments and management's focus on efficiency.
    *   **Working Capital:**
        *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Change in Working Capital will be **1.0% of the change in revenue**.
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** A net **0.5% annual reduction in shares outstanding**, reflecting modest buybacks offset by SBC dilution.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION (REVISED)**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,873.1 | $6,166.7 | $6,413.4 | $6,637.9 | $6,870.2 |
| EBIT (8.0% margin) | $469.8 | $493.3 | $513.1 | $531.0 | $549.6 |
| NOPAT | $399.4 | $419.3 | $436.1 | $451.4 | $467.2 |
| D&A | $504.0 | $511.6 | $519.3 | $527.1 | $535.0 |
| SBC | -$21.9 | -$23.0 | -$24.0 | -$24.8 | -$25.7 |
| Capex | -$323.0 | -$339.2 | -$352.7 | -$365.1 | -$377.9 |
| Change in WC | -$1.7 | -$2.9 | -$2.5 | -$2.2 | -$2.3 |
| **FCFF** | **$556.8** | **$565.9** | **$576.2** | **$586.3** | **$596.2** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%**.
    *   Beta: **1.19** (Source: Finbox, 5-Year).
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.19 * 5.0% = **10.21%***
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = $231.6M / $4,217.0M = **5.49%**.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.49% * (1 - 15.0%) = **4.67%**.
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (E) = $5,571.2M (57%)
    *   Market Value of Debt (D) = $4,217.0M (43%)
    *   *WACC = (57% * 10.21%) + (43% * 4.67%) = 5.82% + 2.01% = **7.83%***

**F) TERMINAL VALUE (REVISED)**

The original model's implied multiple of 9.2x was reasonable but potentially conservative given the quality of the core ingredients business. To better reflect a normalized market valuation for a mature, cyclical company, the Exit Multiple method is used directly, with the Gordon Growth method as a cross-check.

1.  **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $549.6M + $535.0M = **$1,084.6M**.
    *   Ascribing a long-term EV/EBITDA multiple of **10.0x** is appropriate. This is a realistic multiple for a stable industrial/ingredients company with moderate growth, balancing the stability of the food/feed segments with the volatility of the fuel segment.
    *   *Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $1,084.6M * 10.0 = **$10,846.0M***
2.  **Implied Growth Rate Cross-Check:**
    *   This terminal value implies a perpetual growth rate (g).
    *   *g = (WACC * TV - FCFF_Terminal) / (TV + FCFF_Terminal)*
    *   *g = (7.83% * $10,846.0 - $596.2*(1+g)) / ($10,846.0 + $596.2*(1+g))*. Solving for g yields approximately **2.98%**.
    *   An implied growth rate of 2.98% is a realistic long-term expectation, slightly above inflation, supporting the 10.0x multiple as a sound assumption.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE (REVISED)**

*   PV of 5-Year FCFF = $516.4 + $485.6 + $460.6 + $432.8 + $408.2 = **$2,303.6M**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $10,846.0M / (1 + 0.0783)^5 = **$7,425.2M**
*   **Enterprise Value = $2,303.6M + $7,425.2M = $9,728.8M**
*   Less: Net Debt = Total Debt ($4,217.0M) - Cash ($94.6M) = $4,122.4M
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Equity Value = $9,728.8M - $4,122.4M = $5,606.4M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY (REVISED)**

*   Projected Year 5 Shares = 160.0M * (1 - 0.005)^5 = **156.0M**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value = $5,606.4M / 156.0M = $35.94**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $35.94**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $26.00** (Assumes slower recovery, 7.0% margins, and a 9.0x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $45.00** (Assumes stronger growth, 8.5% margins, and an 11.0x exit multiple due to success in higher-value ventures).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Base-Case):**
    *   *$35.94 * (1 - 0.30) = **$25.16***

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company's Fuel segment is highly sensitive to changes in government mandates and subsidies for renewable fuels (e.g., the Renewable Fuel Standard), which can dramatically impact profitability.
2.  **Commodity Price Volatility:** Darling's input costs (animal by-products, used cooking oil) and output prices (fats, proteins, renewable diesel) are subject to significant commodity price swings, affecting margins.
3.  **Integration and JV Risk:** The success of new ventures like the Nextida joint venture for health and wellness ingredients is not guaranteed and requires successful integration and market acceptance to contribute meaningfully to growth.
4.  **Operational Headwinds:** As mentioned in the Q2 2025 earnings call, the company faces challenges including planned turnarounds at facilities (DGD) and tariff volatility, which can impact near-term volumes and profitability.

final answer is 35.94 $
