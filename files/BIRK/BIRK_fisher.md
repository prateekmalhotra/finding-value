Company: Birkenstock Holding plc (BIRK)
Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Q3 2025 Earnings Release (Form 6-K, August 14, 2025), Form 20-F for fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, various investor presentations, and reputable news/trade sources.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Birkenstock's revenue has consistently grown at a double-digit pace, with a 16% constant currency revenue growth in Q3 2025. The company is expanding its product line beyond its iconic sandals to include more closed-toe options, which are growing at twice the rate of the overall business. This product diversification, coupled with a geographic expansion strategy, particularly in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region (24% growth in Q3 2025), suggests a long runway for growth. The company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel is also expanding, with plans to have 100 owned stores by the end of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a commitment to product development and innovation. The expansion into closed-toe shoes and other new product categories is a clear indication of this. The company is also investing in its manufacturing capacity to meet future demand, with a new factory in Pasewalk, Germany, becoming operational in late 2023 and plans to expand its component manufacturing facility in Portugal. These investments in both product and production capacity point to a long-term growth strategy.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Birkenstock does not disclose its R&D spending as a separate line item in its financial reports, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the company's long history of product innovation, centered around its proprietary footbed, and its recent expansion into new product categories, suggest an effective, albeit not traditionally accounted for, R&D function. The company's focus on materials and manufacturing processes can also be considered a form of R&D.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Birkenstock's sales organization is undergoing a strategic shift towards a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, which accounted for 38% of revenues in 2022 and continues to grow. This shift, combined with a selective wholesale distribution strategy, has allowed the company to maintain brand control and achieve high sell-through rates. The company's global presence in over 90 countries and its growing e-commerce platform are further evidence of a strong and evolving sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Birkenstock boasts impressive profit margins. For Q3 2025, the company reported a gross margin of 60.5% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 34.4%. These margins are well above the industry average and demonstrate the company's pricing power and operational efficiency. The company has also raised its full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA margin guidance to 31.3% - 31.8%.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively working to maintain and improve its profit margins through several initiatives. These include a focus on the higher-margin DTC channel, price increases, and investments in production efficiency. The company's vertically integrated manufacturing process also gives it greater control over costs. Management has expressed confidence in its ability to offset tariff and FX headwinds through these measures.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Birkenstock has a Code of Conduct that outlines its commitment to fair labor practices and employee rights, based on international standards. The company's website emphasizes its commitment to its employees and provides a platform for them to voice concerns. However, there is limited publicly available data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations to definitively assess the quality of its labor and personnel relations.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly listed company, Birkenstock is subject to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) regulations and has a dedicated SOX Control & Compliance Manager. The company's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and it provides detailed segment reporting. This suggests a robust system of cost analysis and accounting controls.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Birkenstock's key competitive advantage is its vertically integrated manufacturing process, with over 95% of its products assembled in Germany. This allows for greater control over quality and costs, and reinforces the brand's "Made in Germany" heritage. The company's focus on sustainability and the use of high-quality, natural materials also resonates with a growing segment of consumers and provides a point of differentiation.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's focus on building out the DTC channel, investing in new production capacity, and expanding into new product categories and geographies all point to a long-range outlook. The company's guidance for sustained high-teens revenue growth and strong profitability further supports this view. The company is investing for the long-term, rather than optimizing for short-term profits.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Birkenstock has a strong balance sheet with a net leverage ratio of 1.7x as of June 2025, and a target of 1.5x by year-end. The company is generating strong cash flow from operations and has a healthy liquidity position. The recent share repurchase program, concurrent with a secondary offering by its largest shareholder, demonstrates a commitment to mitigating dilution and returning capital to shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

There are no recent reports of major legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of the management team.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Birkenstock scores well on Fisher's 15-point checklist, with strong positives in its long-term growth potential, profitability, and management quality. The company's iconic brand, loyal customer base, and vertically integrated manufacturing provide a strong competitive moat. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its product and geographic expansion initiatives, as well as its ability to maintain its premium pricing and high margins in a competitive market. The two "No" answers, for R&D effectiveness and labor relations, are due to a lack of specific disclosures rather than any identified weakness. Improved transparency in these areas could lead to a higher score in the future.

fisher score is 13 / 15
