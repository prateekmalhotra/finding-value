Alaska Air Group, Inc. Fisher Analysis: August 22, 2025; Primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K (filed for year-end December 31, 2024), Q2 2025 earnings information, and various news/trade sources.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alaska Air Group, now the fifth-largest U.S. airline, significantly expanded its market potential with the September 2024 acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines. This opens up a vast network across the Pacific to Asia and Australia, supplementing its strong West Coast and North American routes. The company has firm commitments to purchase 90 new aircraft (Boeing 737s, 787s, and Embraer E175s) with options for 100 more, providing a clear path to increase capacity and serve new and existing markets. This combination of an expanded international network and a multi-year fleet growth plan supports a long runway for sales growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively developing its product and service offerings. In August 2025, the company announced the upcoming combined loyalty program, "Atmos Rewards," and a new premium co-branded credit card to enhance customer value and drive high-margin revenue. It also announced the selection of Starlink to provide "the fastest Wi-Fi in the sky," a significant upgrade to its onboard product. The most substantial development is the ongoing integration of Hawaiian Airlines, a multi-year project to combine passenger service systems and streamline operations, which management expects to unlock significant synergies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEnP1Tf0daxT3bWaSnOq5jPZh9fS4wRMNsTnfZANIlyh3yXJrmJGO6bYXz-RedTXNWzOOy1LrwYjVXSWDMAr0QDKWOdL8ejO-DIjXH2fLfx_tGNitL8ewyPMdU527_ubkHv_lzNbiOhtbw= (August 20, 2025)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For an airline, R&D is equivalent to operational efficiency. The 2024 Form 10-K highlights the use of "Flyways AI" technology to optimize flight paths for fuel efficiency, a key cost driver. The company's unit cost excluding fuel (CASMex) was 10.80¢ for the full year 2024. While a direct peer comparison for the exact period is unavailable, this metric demonstrates a focus on cost control. The company's investor materials have previously cited a "durable cost advantage" of 15-20% versus legacy carriers, which, if maintained, would indicate highly effective operational management relative to its size.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE5U-Dtlc-B5bSLCg1VPokH9m_8ggfc59xpOBh3s3VDFUa57LPMI1BN5GGM4OIFVbgOIxkpVLOUUIMZnKrB64uQYNdwJJlJAOQZODqpnLmBzEzV31iIACgaNN-hd5D4hWxDa8M6d3rlSM7UNAg1], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alaska's "sales" are driven by its distribution channels and powerful loyalty program. In 2024, 73% of sales were made through cost-effective direct channels like its website and app. The company's loyalty programs (Mileage Plan and HawaiianMiles) are a key competitive advantage, contributing approximately 16% of total revenue in 2024. The program's structure, which awards miles based on distance flown rather than dollars spent, is a key differentiator from larger competitors and fosters significant loyalty. The planned 2025 integration of the two loyalty programs is expected to further enhance this strength.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Alaska Air Group reported a GAAP pre-tax margin of 4.6% and an adjusted pre-tax margin of 7.1%. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), the airline industry's global net profit margin for 2024 was forecasted to be 2.7%. Alaska's reported adjusted pre-tax margin is substantially higher than the industry average net margin, indicating a worthwhile profit margin relative to its peers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGKS9f0hQciAAf9IZQ7cUjtI4oFGPdday5-7M1iw0ekJb5QiasACF2RO9jwmpEqgt7l2FMWB5HJk76cSgpUHrIUt3E64tQAa0mym7hdS_GozJvDR-WVfg26CntUBPJAWaT-CqhZ7JW0bpC3i60sLeAIna9scxsliT4= (December 6, 2023)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is pursuing margin improvement through several key initiatives outlined in its 2024 10-K. A primary focus is fleet modernization, replacing older aircraft with new, more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 and 787-9 aircraft, which are 20-25% more efficient per seat. Management is also focused on capturing synergies from the Hawaiian Airlines acquisition, which it expects will improve profitability. The company is also increasing the number of premium seats on its aircraft to improve revenue mix and yield.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Approximately 85% of Alaska's and 82% of Hawaiian's employees are unionized. While the company successfully ratified new agreements with its technicians and pilots in 2024, negotiations with its flight attendants were prolonged, with their contract becoming amendable in December 2022 and a tentative agreement only being reached in January 2025. The need to negotiate joint collective bargaining agreements for the combined Alaska and Hawaiian workforces presents a significant, complex challenge. While the company has not experienced major labor disruptions, the high unionization rate and extended negotiations suggest labor relations are a persistent challenge rather than "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team exhibits stability, with long tenures for most senior leaders. CEO Benito Minicucci has been with the company since 2004 and became CEO in 2021. Other key executives, such as the CFO and CCO, also have tenures exceeding a decade with the company. There is no evidence of significant turnover or public discord among the executive team. The successful completion of the complex Hawaiian Airlines acquisition further points to a cohesive and effective leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K lists a nine-person executive committee with clear responsibilities across all major functions, including Finance, Legal, Commercial, Operations, and People. The appointment of the former President of Horizon Air, Joseph Sprague, to CEO of Hawaiian Airlines following the acquisition demonstrates a bench of experienced leaders ready to step into key roles. This structure suggests a thoughtful approach to leadership and succession, mitigating key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alaska Air Group's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent auditor, KPMG LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements. Furthermore, KPMG's report confirmed the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking out results for its Alaska Airlines, Hawaiian Airlines, and Regional operations, indicating robust internal cost analysis. There is no history of major restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage is Alaska's hub dominance on the U.S. West Coast, which the Hawaiian Airlines acquisition extends into a dominant position in Hawai'i. The company's loyalty program, which awards miles based on distance flown, is a significant differentiator that attracts and retains frequent flyers compared to competitor programs based on spending. Furthermore, the company has built a strong reputation for superior customer service and operational reliability, including on-time performance, which are critical non-price competitive factors in the airline industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE5U-Dtlc-B5bSLCg1VPokH9m_8ggfc59xpOBh3s3VDFUa57LPMI1BN5GGM4OIFVbgOIxkpVLOUUIMZnKrB64uQYNdwJJlJAOQZODqpnLmBzEzV31iIACgaNN-hd5D4hWxDa8M6d3rlSM7UNAg1], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The acquisition of Hawaiian Airlines is a primary indicator of a long-range outlook, as the company is incurring significant near-term integration costs with the expectation of long-term strategic benefits and synergies. The company's fleet plan, with firm aircraft orders extending to 2029, shows a commitment to long-term capital investment in efficiency and growth. Management's strategy is centered on sustainable, long-term growth, prioritizing network and fleet investments over short-term profit maximization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong. It funded the $1.9 billion Hawaiian Airlines acquisition entirely with cash and debt, not equity. In 2024, the company repurchased $312 million of its own stock and the Board authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program in late 2024. The company generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations in 2024 and ended the year with $2.5 billion in cash and marketable securities. This demonstrates a strong ability to fund operations, capital expenditures, and strategic moves without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Following the January 5, 2024, incident involving a door plug on a 737-9 MAX flight, management communicated openly. The company provided regular updates on its website and CEO Ben Minicucci gave a public interview stating he was "angry" at Boeing and that the airline had found "some loose bolts on many of our MAX 9s." This public accountability and transparency during a major operational and safety crisis is strong evidence of candor with the public and investors, even when the news was negative. The 10-K also frankly discusses the financial impact, including receiving $162 million in initial compensation from Boeing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEHQfMsyKJjEqMphegPJiY7-3HADBqjpUNeGr_WVnyxD0TprFkhlU8o5KqSbUzbXqk35PdV8Ky1fjWU9CtyCS1nEFodV6aFg36CnfZks_JoTWynqf2VlprSmkirJdFHJDZBpb3lfq_WQUcf1IQj6Ch952FChcTudHFnFRKEO0Mt_e9FkZpviT800sZqLIiB4Y-Irla8TywgDhO5H36wJhFosZFort89gLp0GS8BBetqj06mKP3bQ6QPxMWNGFJY8_ZTC7GPg-_cFypW7kX_B2LwL-Xzo (January 23, 2024)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEKuaAtUmt1yM2PjDw0v0E4cg62wPAQau9T6oJQJxDwlDAChNiGSJbJbUgk-iNNsD8VaCJ5kmNKLrhzC6bVt4XCrO47C2v_Rq-oqqGYeUeMZBIho3gVVfIH4e_0lXK-rZj8CZbVswVnsVsriHZDCej_kQ== (January 5, 2024)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has no history of major financial restatements, and the auditor's report confirms effective internal controls. The 2024 10-K notes the company is party to various litigation incidental to its business, with no indication of material issues arising from management misconduct. CEO Ben Minicucci's direct and frank public statements holding Boeing accountable after the 737-9 MAX incident demonstrated a commitment to safety and transparency, reflecting positively on management's integrity. There are no apparent governance red flags, related-party transactions, or code-of-conduct breaches.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766421/000076642125000009/alk-20241231.htm (December 31, 2024)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEKuaAtUmt1yM2PjDw0v0E4cg62wPAQau9T6oJQJxDwlDAChNiGSJbJbUgk-iNNsD8VaCJ5kmNKLrhzC6bVt4XCrO47C2v_Rq-oqqGYeUeMZBIho3gVVfIH4e_0lXK-rZj8CZbVswVnsVsriHZDCej_kQ== (January 5, 2024)]

**Synthesis:**
Alaska Air Group scores highly on Fisher's checklist, reflecting a well-managed company with a clear long-term strategy. The strongest positives are its expanded long-term growth runway following the Hawaiian Airlines acquisition, a demonstrated commitment to product development (e.g., Starlink Wi-Fi, new loyalty program), a strong balance sheet that obviates the need for dilutive financing, and a management team that has shown stability and candor under pressure. The primary negative and area of risk is labor relations. While relations appear functional, the high degree of unionization and the complexity of integrating two workforces could pressure costs and operations. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two factors: the execution of the Hawaiian Airlines integration and the outcomes of joint labor contract negotiations. Successfully integrating the two loyalty programs and passenger service systems while achieving cost-competitive labor agreements would solidify the company's long-term competitive position and could flip the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes".

fisher score is 14 / 15
