### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CarMax has a significant share repurchase authorization from its Board of Directors. As of February 28, 2025, $1.94 billion remained available for repurchase with no expiration date.
*   **Mechanism:** Aggressive execution of the buyback program reduces the number of shares outstanding. This directly increases Earnings Per Share (EPS), which, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher share price. It also signals management's confidence that the stock is undervalued.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with potential for acceleration in the next 0-12 months. Repurchases are at management's discretion.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Repurchase of $500 million. At an assumed average price of $80/share, this retires 6.25 million shares, or ~4.1% of the 153.3 million shares outstanding (as of Feb 28, 2025), leading to a ~4.3% EPS accretion.
    *   **Base Case:** Repurchase of $1 billion. At an assumed average price of $80/share, this retires 12.5 million shares, or ~8.2% of shares outstanding, leading to a ~8.9% EPS accretion.
    *   **High Case:** Repurchase of $1.5 billion. At an assumed average price of $80/share, this retires 18.75 million shares, or ~12.2% of shares outstanding, leading to a ~13.9% EPS accretion.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (5-15%). The impact is directly tied to the level of EPS accretion and the signal of undervaluation it sends to the market.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a history of repurchasing shares, the authorization is large and in place, and management has stated returning capital to shareholders is part of its allocation strategy. The pace is the main variable.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Sufficient free cash flow generation and management's belief that the share price is attractive for buybacks. Market stability is also a factor.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly cash flow statements (Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities section in 10-Q/10-K).
    *   Changes in shares outstanding reported in quarterly earnings releases.
    *   Management commentary on capital allocation during earnings calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant operational downturn could divert cash flow away from buybacks.
    *   Management may choose to prioritize debt reduction or strategic investments over share repurchases.
    *   A rapid increase in the stock price could make buybacks less attractive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the quarterly execution rate of the buyback program as a key indicator of management's confidence and capital allocation priorities.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Operational Cost Efficiencies in Reconditioning & Logistics
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Management has identified and is pursuing specific cost-saving opportunities in its vehicle reconditioning and logistics network. The company achieved $125 per unit in savings in fiscal 2025 and is targeting an additional $125 per unit in fiscal 2026.
*   **Mechanism:** Realized cost savings per unit directly increase the gross profit per unit, assuming selling prices remain constant. This flows directly to the bottom line, improving operating margins and net income, which can lead to a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** Throughout fiscal year 2026 (March 2025 - February 2026).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Target:** $125 per unit in additional savings in FY2026.
    *   **Low Case ($75/unit savings):** On 789,050 used units sold in FY2025, this implies a gross profit increase of ~$59.2 million, or ~$0.38 per share pre-tax.
    *   **Base Case ($125/unit savings):** On 789,050 used units sold in FY2025, this implies a gross profit increase of ~$98.6 million, or ~$0.63 per share pre-tax.
    *   **High Case ($150/unit savings):** On 789,050 used units sold in FY2025, this implies a gross profit increase of ~$118.4 million, or ~$0.76 per share pre-tax.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-10%). While the absolute dollar amount is significant, it is a smaller component of the overall profit picture but provides a clear, near-term boost to earnings.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company successfully achieved its FY2025 target and has provided a specific target for FY2026, suggesting high confidence in its ability to execute.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful implementation of new processes and technologies in reconditioning centers and logistics network. Stable labor costs.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Used Vehicle Gross Profit per Unit (reported quarterly).
    *   Wholesale Vehicle Gross Profit per Unit (as logistics also affect this).
    *   Management commentary on efficiency initiatives in earnings calls/filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Inflationary pressures on parts and labor could offset savings.
    *   Execution challenges in rolling out new processes across a large network.
    *   Supply chain disruptions for reconditioning parts.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This catalyst is high-probability and provides a tangible floor for near-term earnings improvement.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) Full-Spectrum Lending Expansion
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CarMax is expanding its captive finance arm, CAF, to provide lending across the full credit spectrum, aiming to capture profitable originations currently going to Tier 2 and Tier 3 lending partners. The company began testing new credit scoring models in fiscal 2025 to enable this expansion.
*   **Mechanism:** By originating and holding a higher percentage of the loans made to its customers, CarMax can capture the entire net interest margin, which is more profitable than the fees received from third-party lenders. Successfully underwriting and servicing these loans at scale would create a significant, high-margin recurring revenue stream.
*   **Timing:** 12–36 months. The company began testing in FY2025 and plans a measured expansion, anticipating capturing more volume in the back half of fiscal 2026.
*   **Quantification:** Management states that each additional percentage point of CAF penetration is expected to generate $10 million to $12 million in lifetime pre-tax income per year of origination.
    *   **Low Case (2% penetration gain):** 2 * $10M = $20 million in additional annual pre-tax income run-rate.
    *   **Base Case (5% penetration gain):** 5 * $11M = $55 million in additional annual pre-tax income run-rate.
    *   **High Case (8% penetration gain):** 8 * $12M = $96 million in additional annual pre-tax income run-rate.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%). A $55 million pre-tax income increase represents a ~8% increase over FY2025 earnings before tax and would be a high-margin, recurring addition to profits, likely warranting a significant valuation re-rating.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company is deliberately investing in and testing this strategy. The primary uncertainty lies in the magnitude of the penetration gain and the credit performance of the new loan cohorts over a full economic cycle.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Success of new proprietary credit scoring models in accurately pricing risk.
    *   Availability of efficient funding for non-prime receivables through the securitization market.
    *   Maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment to avoid a spike in loan losses.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   CAF net penetration rate (reported quarterly).
    *   CAF income and Provision for Loan Losses (reported quarterly).
    *   Delinquency rates and net credit losses as a percentage of managed receivables.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A recession or economic downturn could lead to higher-than-expected loan losses, negating the benefits of higher penetration.
    *   Inaccurate credit models could lead to adverse selection and poor portfolio performance.
    *   Disruptions in the asset-backed securitization market could increase funding costs.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The potential long-term value creation is significant. Investors should monitor credit quality metrics closely as the strategy rolls out.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase (Catalyst #1)**
*   **Mechanism:** EPS Accretion.
*   **Formula:** New EPS = Net Income / (Old Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)
*   **Assumptions:** Base Case repurchase of $1.0 billion; Avg. Price = $80/share; FY2025 Net Income = $500.6M; FY2025 Shares Outstanding (diluted) = 156.1M.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Shares Repurchased = $1,000,000,000 / $80 = 12.5 million shares.
    *   New Shares Outstanding = 156.1M - 12.5M = 143.6 million.
    *   FY2025 EPS = $500.6M / 156.1M = $3.21.
    *   New EPS = $500.6M / 143.6M = $3.49.
    *   **EPS Uplift: +8.7%**
*   **Valuation Impact:** Assuming a constant P/E ratio, this implies an **8.7% increase in the share price**.

**2. CAF Expansion (Catalyst #2)**
*   **Mechanism:** Net Income Growth.
*   **Formula:** New Net Income = Old Net Income + (Penetration Gain * Income per Point * (1 - Tax Rate))
*   **Assumptions:** Base Case 5% penetration gain; $11M pre-tax income per point; Effective Tax Rate of 25.2%.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Pre-Tax Income Gain = 5 * $11,000,000 = $55 million.
    *   After-Tax Income Gain = $55,000,000 * (1 - 0.252) = $41.14 million.
    *   FY2025 Net Income = $500.6 million.
    *   New Net Income = $500.6M + $41.14M = $541.74 million.
    *   **Net Income Uplift: +8.2%**
*   **Valuation Impact:** An 8.2% increase in net income would justify a similar rise in share price, but given this is a high-margin, recurring revenue stream, it could lead to multiple expansion, potentially driving a **10-15% share price increase** over the long term.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts (0-12 months) appears positive. The high probability of realizing further operational cost savings provides a tangible floor for gross profit improvement. This, combined with the significant potential for EPS accretion from the authorized share repurchase program, creates a favorable setup for positive stock performance. While the macro environment for used cars remains a headwind, these company-specific initiatives provide a clear path to value creation independent of the broader market, sending a bullish short-term signal.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Economic Downturn:** A sharp rise in unemployment and contraction in credit availability could significantly reduce consumer demand for used vehicles and dramatically increase loan losses in the CAF portfolio, overwhelming any internal cost-saving or buyback efforts. (Risk Factors, 10-K)
2.  **Aggressive Competitive Pricing:** Increased competition from online-only retailers or franchised dealers could lead to a price war, compressing retail gross margins and negating the benefits of operational efficiencies. (Competition, 10-K)
3.  **Credit Market Disruption:** A seizure in the asset-backed securitization market would severely limit CarMax's ability to fund CAF's loan originations, halting the CAF expansion strategy and potentially impacting retail sales volumes. (Capital and Credit Markets Risk, 10-K)

---

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

Based on this analysis, the recommendation is a **Buy**. The most significant near-term catalyst is the execution of the $1.94 billion share repurchase authorization, which alone could drive a 5-15% EPS accretion. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly CAF net penetration rate, as success in the long-term full-spectrum lending strategy represents the largest opportunity for sustained, high-margin earnings growth and a potential stock re-rating.
