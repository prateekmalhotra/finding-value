### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

*   **Organic Revenue Growth:** "for fiscal 2025, we remain confident in our ability to deliver low-single-digit organic revenue growth".
*   **Core Constant Currency EPS:** To be "approximately even with the prior year".
*   **Shareholder Returns:** "Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8.6 billion, comprised of dividends of $7.6 billion and share repurchases of $1.0 billion".

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Based on management's "low-single-digit" guidance, a 3.0% growth rate is assumed for Year 1, tapering down to 2.5% by Year 5 to reflect a mature market.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 15.2%. This is assumed to remain stable over the forecast period, as no specific margin expansion initiatives were detailed in the guidance.
*   **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is 19.3%. Management has not provided specific guidance, so this rate will be used for the forecast period.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex as a percentage of revenue is 5.6%. This is assumed to continue over the forecast period.
    *   **Working Capital:** The 3-year average change in working capital as a percentage of the change in revenue is 25%. This will be used to project future working capital needs.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is treated as a real cash cost and will be subtracted in the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) calculation.
    *   The latest diluted share count of 1,373 million will be used for the final per-share value calculation.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

FCFF is calculated using the following formula:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - SBC**

This represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $94,500 | $14,364 | $8,834 |
| 2 | $97,144 | $14,766 | $9,088 |
| 3 | $99,853 | $15,178 | $9,350 |
| 4 | $102,599 | $15,595 | $9,619 |
| 5 | $105,164 | $16,000 | $9,864 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 0.46 (5-year monthly beta). This reflects the company's lower volatility relative to the broader market.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 0.46 * 5.0% = 6.60%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Interest Expense / Average Debt = $876 / (($51,384 + $47,751)/2) = 1.77%**
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 1.77% * (1 - 19.3%) = 1.43%
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Capitalization = $150.73 * 1,373 = $206,950 million
    *   Enterprise Value = $206,950 + $51,384 - $7,631 = $250,703 million
    *   **WACC = (206,950/250,703) * 6.60% + (43,753/250,703) * 1.43% = 5.70%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of 2.5% is used, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = ($9,864 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.057 - 0.025) = $312,856 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = $16,000 (EBIT) + $3,765 (D&A) = $19,765 million.
    *   Assuming a conservative 12x exit multiple (in line with historical averages): **$19,765 * 12 = $237,180 million**.
    *   The lower of the two terminal values, the Exit Multiple, will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value** = PV of explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value
    *   PV of FCFF = $8,834/(1.057)^1 + $9,088/(1.057)^2 + ... + $9,864/(1.057)^5 = $42,963 million
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $237,180 / (1.057)^5 = $179,890 million
    *   **Enterprise Value = $42,963 + $179,890 = $222,853 million**
*   **Equity Value** = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Net Debt = $51,384 (Total Debt) - $7,631 (Cash) = $43,753 million
    *   **Equity Value = $222,853 - $43,753 = $179,100 million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **$179,100 million / 1,373 million shares = $130.44 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($110):** Assumes lower revenue growth (1.5%) and margin compression (14.5% operating margin).
    *   **High/Bull Case ($150):** Assumes higher revenue growth (4.0%) and slight margin expansion (15.5% operating margin).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value results in a **MOS Price of $91.31**.

### **Risk Notes**

The base-case valuation is subject to several risks, including: 1) sustained inflation and higher input costs pressuring margins; 2) shifts in consumer preferences away from core snack and beverage categories toward healthier alternatives; 3) increased competition from private label and smaller, more agile brands; 4) adverse foreign currency fluctuations given the company's significant international presence; and 5) potential for increased regulation and taxes on sugary drinks and snacks.

final answer is 130.44 $
