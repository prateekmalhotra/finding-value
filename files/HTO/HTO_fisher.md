Company: H2O America (HTO) [analyzing SJW Group], August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Q1 2025 Financial Results Press Release, 2023 Annual Report.

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a water utility, H2O America's growth is driven by rate increases tied to capital investments and customer base expansion. The company announced a 25% increase in its five-year capital investment plan to approximately $2.0 billion, underpinning a long-term earnings growth rate target of 5% to 7% through 2029. In 2023, the company saw accelerated customer growth in its Texas service area of 12%. A successful General Rate Case (GRC) decision in California that took effect on January 1, 2025, is set to increase revenues by $53.1 million over the three-year cycle, demonstrating the regulatory path for sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's development is focused on improving its infrastructure and operations rather than creating new "products." Management's commitment is demonstrated by its significant capital expenditure plan, which includes $473 million for 2025 alone. These investments in infrastructure are what drive rate cases and, consequently, future revenue. The 2023 Annual Report details specific process improvements, such as replacing 47 miles of water mains to enhance reliability and reduce long-term operating costs. The company is also actively securing new water supplies to support high-growth regions like Texas.
**Answer:** Yes

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** H2O America, as a regulated utility, does not have a formal R&D program in the traditional sense of developing new products for competitive markets. Its innovation is focused on adopting and deploying proven technologies to improve operational efficiency and water quality. An older filing from 2021 mentioned plans to deploy Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI). However, recent financial reports and transcripts do not provide specific metrics on R&D spending or its direct outcomes, making it impossible to evaluate its effectiveness relative to size.
**Answer:** No

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the utility context, an effective "sales" function translates to successful customer growth and regulatory management. The company demonstrates strength here, having added approximately 3,000 new residential connections in 2023, with its Texas operation growing its customer base by 12%. Critically, management has a proven ability to navigate the regulatory process to secure rate increases, which is the primary driver of revenue growth. The recently approved GRC in California authorizes a $53.1 million revenue increase over three years (2025-2027) and was a key driver of strong Q1 2025 results.
**Answer:** Yes

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, H2O America reported revenue of $748.4 million and GAAP net income of $94.0 million, yielding a net profit margin of approximately 12.5%. While this is below the 22% margin reported by its largest peer, American Water Works, it is above the general utility sector average of 10-11% cited in a Q1 2022 analysis. In Q1 2025, the company's net income grew 41%, demonstrating strong profitability and margin support from new rates.
**Answer:** Yes

6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The primary strategy for margin maintenance is securing timely and adequate rate relief from public utility commissions to recover capital investments and operating costs. The successful California GRC, which authorized new rates for 2025-2027, is a prime example of this strategy in action. In its Q1 2025 earnings call, management attributed strong results to this rate increase and "prudent cost management." The company is also pursuing a System Infrastructure Charge in Texas to provide an additional $4.1 million in annual revenue.
**Answer:** Yes

7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent earnings call transcripts and financial press releases do not contain specific information regarding employee attrition, engagement metrics, union relations, or safety records. While the company was named one of "America's Most Responsible Companies 2025" by Newsweek, which touches on social factors, this is a high-level award and not concrete evidence of outstanding internal labor relations. Without specific disclosures, this point cannot be verified.
**Answer:** No

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable at the highest levels, with Eric Thornburg (CEO) and Andrew Walters (CFO) leading earnings calls consistently. There is evidence of orderly succession planning, with the appointment of a new Chief Accounting Officer in June 2025. Insider ownership is reported at 8.19%, indicating significant alignment between management and shareholder interests. This level of ownership and stability in key roles suggests strong executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** H2O America's quarterly earnings calls feature a broad team of executives beyond the CEO, including the Chief Financial Officer (Andrew Walters), Chief Operating Officer (Bruce Hauk), and Chief Administrative Officer (Kristen Johnson). This demonstrates a deep bench of senior leaders actively involved in operations and strategy. The company has also made recent appointments to key roles, such as a new Chief Human Resources Officer in April 2025 and a new Chief Accounting Officer in June 2025, suggesting a focus on maintaining management depth.
**Answer:** Yes

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed financial reporting in accordance with GAAP. It also presents non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted net income, and clearly reconciles them to their GAAP counterparts, explaining adjustments for items like merger-related expenses. This level of transparency in financial reporting indicates robust accounting controls. Operating expenses are broken down, with specific drivers like higher water production costs and extraction charges being called out in quarterly results, suggesting a granular level of cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEd-ZwnfIDOeZBiL-iUGKuf2oASEb_JamBsUoBRwRQrgHT-XsjUDtZvDAlEg2MdDg_8iwPUDAjrbundozPA6J3Sh0zFPoqKvdEKIk3LZo3SUn7t8CLrf2iW0YnI0ggw1Ol7lyh0m4MwbLmA1uJLgy6_Z0UOapCN4Omlp9FtkizhaR3mGE4qKn8Uhq17fCPPeWHVZgiDC5L8p27QINQhKt6L0SdV12pxtkecSksnWBsPMkJsYTFjgww6BduE] (April 28, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHlzumsp66vojP3WKB2hxSpGXR3KMfXhmrESvugVg7WQRySBMnVutObRQjg0tQi7gAb3Ct075Eo1resmanSESQZenNxlg4FhtIdFP3o8n8XuCD-7S9MhzE0wnh94f54twdL3soePDvdvXFu_XBDc64lahEMpgqBtUXogkTx4ZU1WzPiNNFBbPFY8LL_SbySayknJ5g4njS6GaKRhlNABc_jx70b7w8SjTi8HZWRyK5QsOGWVzCmGfhXEQ==] (April 29, 2025)

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a water utility, key differentiators are service territory quality and regulatory skill. H2O America operates in diverse geographic areas, including the high-growth corridor north of San Antonio, Texas, which saw 12% customer growth in 2023. This geographic diversification insulates it from regional risks like droughts or singular adverse regulatory environments. The company's consistent success in securing favorable rate cases, such as the recent GRC in California, is a testament to its strong regulatory relationships, a crucial competitive advantage in this industry.
**Answer:** Yes

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's entire business model is predicated on a long-range outlook. Management has committed to a five-year, ~$2.0 billion capital investment plan, which requires significant near-term spending to generate future returns through rate increases. They provide a long-term earnings growth target of 5% to 7% through 2029, explicitly guiding investors to focus on multi-year performance. This strategy demonstrates a clear willingness to reinvest heavily in the business for sustainable, long-term profit growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGQBUZWndz_mAA4ZBQ0wS4lWSQ73aXF0TNJq3u16thJWO3T5GYlQhxcM5fkGvagSvvO_g7B8hDHmYoJCLo7OulpiSnHwy5MFQkExek4QkANkh1DIexuPHYlGpNT8r6xTLGZITHdGVonn7l6uXNBnKMbZUqbTNGoM52usbvLdHSzMHdYXrZOl57NeEOsPsnJtDjYxeSiNpRFu8iAXY00otgZd98Q_LRaGAaJrQqmBeMV61WtSzf7_IEY8xbUzrgTzsppsOBo] (February 27, 2025)

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Based on Q1 2025 results, the company has a long-term debt of $1.691 billion and stockholders' equity of $1.397 billion, for a debt-to-equity ratio of ~1.21. This level of leverage is common for capital-intensive utilities and appears manageable. The company funds its capital program through a combination of debt and internally generated cash flow, with returns provided by rate increases. H2O America has a 57-year history of consecutive dividend increases, signaling a stable and predictable financial model that has not historically relied on dilutive equity financing for its core growth.
**Answer:** Yes

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management communicates with investors through regular quarterly earnings calls, providing detailed slide presentations and hosting Q&A sessions. In its Q1 2025 results, the company openly discussed challenges, such as the rise in water production expenses and ongoing litigation risks, while also highlighting positive results. They provide both GAAP and non-GAAP financial figures with clear reconciliations, and they issue long-term growth guidance, all of which are signs of a transparent and candid relationship with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent financial reports and news does not reveal any significant legal issues, regulatory actions, or governance red flags that would question management's integrity. The company highlights its recognition by Newsweek as one of "America's Most Responsible Companies 2025," which is based on a holistic view of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. While the Q1 2025 results mention ongoing litigation related to contaminants, this is a common issue for the water utility industry and not indicative of a specific integrity lapse.

Synthesis:
H2O America (SJW Group) scores well on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting the classic strengths of a well-managed, regulated water utility. Its strongest positives are a long runway for growth driven by a substantial $2.0 billion capital investment plan, a proven ability to secure growth through regulatory rate cases, and a stable, shareholder-aligned management team. The primary weaknesses identified are a lack of information on labor relations and the absence of a formal R&D function, which is typical for this industry. The Fisher score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables: the outcome of pending rate cases in Texas and other jurisdictions, and the company's ability to execute its large capital expenditure plan on budget. A "No" on R&D effectiveness would flip to a "Yes" if management began disclosing metrics on technology adoption (like AMI) and its direct impact on operational efficiency or water loss reduction.

fisher score is 13 / 15
