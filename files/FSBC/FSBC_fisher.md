Five Star Bancorp (FSBC), August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed include the Annual Report (Form 10-K) for the year ended December 31, 2024, and the Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q) for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**  
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Star Bancorp focuses on commercial banking for small and medium-sized businesses in Northern California, a large and dynamic market. The company is actively pursuing growth, as evidenced by its 2024 expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area, where it opened a new branch and hired a team of eight business development officers. This geographic expansion into a major metropolitan area provides a significant runway for growth in both loans and deposits. For the first quarter of 2025, total loans held for investment grew by $89.1 million, or 2.52%, demonstrating continued strong demand for its services.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a clear commitment to developing its business beyond its core market. The most significant evidence is the strategic expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area in 2024, a major initiative to enter a new market and increase sales potential. The company also continues to invest in technology to support growth, noting in its Q1 2025 report that data processing and software expenses rose due to "increased usage of our digital banking platform" and a higher number of users on its loan origination system. This shows a dual focus on geographic expansion and technological enhancement to drive future growth.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a community bank, R&D is analogous to investments in technology and new product capabilities. Five Star Bancorp is investing in this area, as shown by a 25.9% year-over-year increase in data processing and software expenses in the first quarter of 2025. These investments support the bank's digital platform and loan origination systems. However, the company's public filings do not provide specific metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of this spending, such as quantifying market share gains from new technology or comparing the ROI of these investments to peers. Without such evidence of output or effectiveness, this criterion is not met.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's performance indicates a strong sales function, which for a bank consists of its business development officers and lending teams. Loan growth is robust, with total loans held for investment increasing by $89.1 million in Q1 2025, an annualized growth rate of over 10%. This growth is driven by a relationship-focused strategy and supported by a specific, targeted expansion into the San Francisco market, for which the company hired a team of eight business development officers in 2024. Sustained, high-quality loan growth is the primary indicator of an effective sales organization for a bank.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Star Bancorp exhibits strong profitability. For the quarter ended March 31, 2025, its Net Interest Margin (NIM) was 3.45%, its Return on Average Assets (ROAA) was 1.30%, and its Return on Average Equity (ROAE) was 13.28%. The bank's efficiency ratio was 42.58% for the same period, which is a key indicator of profitability in banking (a lower ratio is better) and suggests excellent cost control relative to revenues. These figures represent strong and worthwhile margins for a community bank.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively managing its balance sheet to support margins. Management attributes the 31 basis point year-over-year increase in net interest margin to growth in "a higher balance of loans with higher yields," indicating a focus on disciplined underwriting and pricing in its core business. The company's expansion into new markets and focus on commercial lending are strategic actions aimed at originating higher-yielding assets. Furthermore, the company maintains a low efficiency ratio (42.58%), demonstrating a continuous focus on operating expense discipline which directly supports profitability.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 Annual Report states, "We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements." It highlights a commitment to creating an inclusive workplace with competitive compensation, benefits, and professional development opportunities managed by a Director of Employee Engagement. As of December 31, 2024, the company had 210 employees, and none are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The available evidence points to positive labor relations.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the proxy statement containing detailed executive tenure is incorporated by reference, the company's filings provide no indication of instability or disputes among the executive team or the board. The bank has operated since 1999, and the consistent execution of its strategy suggests a stable and effective leadership team. The 2024 10-K also details a Management Loan Committee and a Director Loan Committee, indicating a structured and collaborative relationship between management and the board on core business operations.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's ability to execute a major strategic initiative like entering the San Francisco market provides evidence of management depth. The 2024 10-K states that this expansion involved hiring a team that included eight business development officers, four relationship managers, and three loan officers, not just a single executive. This demonstrates an ability to attract and build out experienced teams rather than relying on a few key individuals. The existence of a formal Management Loan Committee comprised of the CEO, CCO, and other senior officers also points to a team-based approach to critical decision-making.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Moss Adams LLP, issued an unqualified "clean" opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, stating they are presented fairly in all material respects. In Item 9A of the same report, management concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There is no history of restatements or mention of material weaknesses in internal controls. The company's consistently low efficiency ratio (42.58% in Q1 2025) further suggests strong cost controls.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key clue for a community bank's performance is its efficiency ratio, which measures non-interest expense as a percentage of revenue. Five Star's efficiency ratio of 42.58% for Q1 2025 is exceptionally strong and well below the industry average, indicating superior operational management. Another clue is its market position; as of June 30, 2024, it was the sixth-largest bank by deposit share in its core Sacramento market, with the top five being money-center banks, making it a dominant local institution. The bank's focus on niche lending areas like manufactured home communities and RV parks also suggests specialized expertise that can lead to better risk-adjusted returns.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions demonstrate a long-range outlook. The strategic decision to expand into the highly competitive San Francisco Bay Area in 2024 is a multi-year investment in future growth. This initiative required significant upfront non-interest expense for hiring and a new branch, which impacts short-term profitability but is aimed at building a larger, more diversified revenue base for the long term. The 2024 Annual Report explicitly states a strategy to "leverage our technology platforms to improve our efficiency" and "further engage in the economic development of our communities," both of which are long-term value creation activities.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's capital position is strong, with a total risk-based capital ratio of 13.97% at the end of Q1 2025, well above the 10.5% threshold to be considered well-capitalized with buffers. However, in April 2024, the company completed a public offering of common stock that raised net proceeds of approximately $80.9 million to "support continued growth." While this capital raise was executed from a position of strength to accelerate growth, it did result in dilution for existing shareholders. Because management recently resorted to a meaningful equity issuance to fund its growth plans, the answer is no.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s disclosures in its SEC filings are detailed and transparent. For example, the Management's Discussion and Analysis section of the 2024 10-K provides a clear, quantitative breakdown of changes to its Allowance for Credit Losses methodology, explaining the specific dollar impact of adjustments for different loan pools. The Q1 2025 10-Q clearly explains the drivers of changes in non-interest income and expense, such as a decrease in gain on sale of loans and an increase in professional services fees related to its San Francisco expansion. This level of specific and clear disclosure in its official filings suggests a culture of candor.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's recent SEC filings reveals no evidence of significant legal or regulatory issues that would call management's integrity into question. The 2024 Annual Report notes that while the company is subject to legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, management does not believe any pending matters will have a material adverse effect. Furthermore, the company received an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, and there are no disclosed related-party transactions that appear problematic.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

---  
**Synthesis:**  
Five Star Bancorp scores well on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting strong profitability, a disciplined and growth-oriented management team, and a clear strategy with a long runway. The bank's strengths are its dominant position in its core Sacramento market, excellent operational efficiency, and a proven ability to expand into new markets. The primary negatives identified are a lack of specific data to prove the effectiveness of its technology spending and a recent, dilutive equity offering to fund growth. The score would most likely be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the success of the San Francisco expansion. Evidence of significant, profitable loan and deposit growth from that market would be a major positive catalyst. To flip the "No" on R&D Effectiveness, the company would need to disclose metrics linking its technology investments to specific positive business outcomes. The "No" on Equity Financing would flip if the company can demonstrate its ability to fund its next phase of growth through retained earnings and other non-dilutive sources, proving the 2024 offering was a one-time acceleration event rather than a recurring necessity.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
