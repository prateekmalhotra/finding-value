**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Given ASML's highly concentrated customer base of major chipmakers, its sales organization is more of a strategic partnership and engineering collaboration function. The company's backlog of €39.0 billion at the end of 2023 demonstrates the effectiveness of its customer relationships. The fact that all major chipmakers use ASML's technology is another indicator of an effective, albeit unconventional, sales organization.

Synthesis:
ASML scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its dominant market position, strong financial performance, and long-term growth prospects. The company's near-monopoly in EUV lithography, a critical technology for the semiconductor industry, provides a strong competitive advantage and significant pricing power. The primary risk to the company's score in the next 12-24 months is geopolitical, particularly related to export controls and tariffs, which could impact sales to China. A significant worsening of the macroeconomic environment could also impact customer capital expenditures. To change the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes," more disclosure on employee satisfaction and retention metrics would be needed.

fisher score is 14 / 15
