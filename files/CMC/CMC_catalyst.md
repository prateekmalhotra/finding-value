### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
- **Type:** Corporate Action
- **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has an active share repurchase program with $305.3 million remaining available for execution as of February 28, 2025. Continued execution of this program will reduce the number of outstanding shares.
- **Mechanism:** A lower share count increases earnings per share (EPS), all else being equal. A rising EPS is a key metric for many investors and can lead to a higher stock price.
- **Timing:** Ongoing, with potential for acceleration or completion within the next 12 months.
- **Quantification:**
    - **Low Case:** 25% of the remaining authorization is used (~$76 million), repurchasing ~1.4 million shares (at an assumed $55/share), leading to a ~1.2% reduction in shares outstanding.
    - **Base Case:** 50% of the remaining authorization is used (~$153 million), repurchasing ~2.8 million shares, leading to a ~2.3% reduction in shares outstanding.
    - **High Case:** 100% of the remaining authorization is used (~$305 million), repurchasing ~5.5 million shares, leading to a ~4.6% reduction in shares outstanding.
- **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (+2-5%). The impact is directly tied to the reduction in shares outstanding, which should lead to a proportional increase in EPS and, therefore, the stock price, assuming a constant P/E multiple.
- **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, with 1,001,096 shares repurchased in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024.
- **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's cash flow must remain sufficient to fund the repurchases without compromising operational needs or dividend payments.
- **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    - Quarterly reports (10-Q, 10-K) for updates on the remaining repurchase authorization.
    - Cash flow from operations in quarterly financial statements.
    - Announcements of any new or expanded repurchase programs.
- **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    - A significant downturn in the steel market could reduce cash flow and lead the company to preserve cash rather than repurchase shares.
    - The company could choose to allocate capital to other priorities, such as debt reduction or acquisitions.
    - The share price could increase significantly, making repurchases less attractive.
- **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of share repurchases each quarter.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** North American Infrastructure Spending
- **Type:** Macro
- **Description (1–2 sentences):** CMC is well-positioned to benefit from increased infrastructure spending in North America, driven by government initiatives. This increased spending is expected to drive demand for the company's steel products, such as rebar, which is a key component of most construction projects.
- **Mechanism:** Increased demand for CMC's products will lead to higher sales volumes and potentially higher prices, boosting revenue and earnings. This would likely lead to a higher valuation for the company.
- **Timing:** 12-60 months. Infrastructure projects have long lead times.
- **Quantification:**
    - **Low Case:** A 5% increase in North American finished steel volumes over the next 3-5 years.
    - **Base Case:** A 10% increase in North American finished steel volumes over the next 3-5 years.
    - **High Case:** A 15% increase in North American finished steel volumes over the next 3-5 years.
- **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+10-20%). A sustained increase in demand would lead to higher earnings and a potential re-rating of the stock.
- **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. There is bipartisan support for infrastructure spending, and many projects are already in the planning stages.
- **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Government funding for infrastructure projects must be approved and disbursed. The company must have the capacity to meet the increased demand.
- **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    - Government announcements on infrastructure spending.
    - Company's backlog and new project awards.
    - North American finished steel shipment volumes in quarterly reports.
- **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    - Political delays or reductions in infrastructure spending.
    - A recession could reduce overall construction activity, offsetting the impact of infrastructure spending.
    - Increased competition could limit the company's ability to capitalize on the increased demand.
- **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The long-term trend of increased infrastructure spending is a significant tailwind for the company.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Margin Expansion from New Micro Mills
- **Type:** Operational
- **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is investing in new, lower-cost micro mills, such as Arizona 2. These mills are more energy-efficient and have a lower operating cost than traditional steel mills, which should lead to higher margins.
- **Mechanism:** Lower operating costs will lead to higher EBITDA margins, which will increase profitability and cash flow. This should result in a higher valuation for the company.
- **Timing:** 12–36 months. The new mills need to be fully ramped up to realize their full potential.
- **Quantification:**
    - **Low Case:** 50 basis point improvement in consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin.
    - **Base Case:** 100 basis point improvement in consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin.
    - **High Case:** 150 basis point improvement in consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin.
- **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+15-25%). A significant and sustained improvement in margins would be a major driver of the stock price.
- **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a proven track record of successfully operating micro mills.
- **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The new mills must be completed on time and on budget. The company must be able to operate the new mills at high utilization rates.
- **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    - Company announcements on the progress of the new mills.
    - Commissioning costs related to the new mills in quarterly reports.
    - Consolidated and segment adjusted EBITDA margins in quarterly reports.
- **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    - Delays or cost overruns in the construction of the new mills.
    - A sharp drop in steel prices could offset the benefits of the lower operating costs.
    - The company may not be able to achieve the expected efficiency gains.
- **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The new micro mills are a key part of the company's long-term strategy and have the potential to be a major value driver.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Margin Expansion from New Micro Mills**
- **Base Case:** A 100 basis point improvement in consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin on $7.9 billion of sales (fiscal 2024) would result in an additional $79 million of EBITDA. At a 6x EV/EBITDA multiple, this would add ~$474 million to the company's enterprise value, or a ~10% increase to the company's current market capitalization.

**2. Share Repurchase Program Execution**
- **Base Case:** The repurchase of ~$153 million of stock would reduce the share count by ~2.3%. This would increase EPS by ~2.3%, and at a P/E of 10x, would result in a ~2.3% increase in the stock price.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**
The near-term catalysts for CMC are moderately positive. The ongoing share repurchase program provides a direct, albeit small, boost to EPS and shareholder returns. The primary near-term risk is a cyclical downturn in the construction market, but the company's healthy backlog and recent project awards provide some visibility. The market signal is cautiously optimistic for the next 0-12 months.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**
1. **Severe Global Recession:** A deep and prolonged global recession would significantly reduce demand for steel, leading to lower prices and volumes, and negating the positive impact of any company-specific catalysts.
2. **Major Operational Disruption:** A major fire, explosion, or other accident at one of the company's key facilities could halt production and lead to significant financial losses.
3. **Unexpected Regulatory Action:** New environmental or safety regulations could impose significant costs on the company, reducing profitability and cash flow.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**
Based on the analysis, the recommendation is a **Buy** for investors with a long-term time horizon. The most significant catalyst is the margin expansion from the new micro mills, which has the potential to add 15-25% to the stock price over the next 12-36 months. The most important indicator to monitor is the company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin, as reported in its quarterly financial statements.

### **12) Final Rating**
catalyst score is 3 / 5
