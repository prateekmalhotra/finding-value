Scholastic Corporation (SCHL), analysis date August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: FY 2025 10-K, Q3 2025 10-Q, and Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### **1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic is a mature company in the children's publishing and education market. While it benefits from evergreen franchises like *Dog Man* and *The Hunger Games*, its core markets are characterized by modest growth. For fiscal year 2025, the company narrowed its outlook from 4-6% growth to "modest full-year revenue growth," citing "increasing pressure on family and school spending." The Education Solutions segment, in particular, has seen declining revenues due to shifts in school district spending. While the recent acquisition of 9 Story Media Group for the new Entertainment segment offers a potential new growth avenue, its immediate impact is still developing amidst industry-wide production slowdowns. The company's ability to generate a "sizable" increase in sales is not strongly supported by recent performance or market conditions.
**Answer:** No

### **2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic demonstrates a commitment to development primarily through strategic acquisitions and product line extensions. The June 2024 acquisition of 9 Story Media Group created a new Entertainment segment, aiming to better monetize its vast intellectual property across different media platforms. The company is also actively developing new products for its Education Solutions segment, with launches planned for the upcoming school year to address market shifts toward evidence-based core programs. In its core publishing business, Scholastic continues to support and expand its major franchises, such as the recent release of a new *Hunger Games* book. These actions indicate a clear strategy to evolve beyond its traditional base.
**Answer:** Yes

### **3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic does not break out R&D spending in its financial statements, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. Development costs are captured in "Prepublication costs," which are amortized. For the nine months ended February 28, 2025, prepublication expenditures were $15.8 million, a slight decrease from $17.2 million in the prior year period. The company's primary "R&D" is in content acquisition and development. Its effectiveness is demonstrated by its ability to create and sustain global best-selling series like *Dog Man* and *Hunger Games*, which continue to drive sales. However, the Education Solutions segment has struggled, with recent product impairments and declining sales suggesting less effective development in that area. The mixed results suggest an effective, but not outstanding, R&D function relative to its size.
**Answer:** No

### **4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's unique, school-based distribution network for its Book Fairs and Book Clubs represents a significant competitive advantage and a highly effective sales channel. In Q3 2025, Book Fairs revenue grew 8% year-over-year, driven by a higher fair count, and the company is on track to hold 90,000 fairs in fiscal 2025. Book Clubs revenue increased 14% in the same period due to higher order volumes. This demonstrates strong execution in its core school channels. However, the Education Solutions segment, which relies on a different sales model targeting school districts, has seen revenues decline by 16.5% in the quarter, indicating challenges in that area. While the school-based organization is clearly above-average, the difficulties in the education segment prevent a "Yes" for the consolidated company.
**Answer:** No

### **5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the nine months ended February 28, 2025, Scholastic's consolidated operating margin was negative at (3.4%), an expected result due to the high seasonality of its business. The Children's Book Publishing and Distribution segment, its largest, posted a healthy operating margin of 10.8% for the same period. In the seasonally strong Q4 of fiscal 2025, the company is targeting solid earnings growth for fiscal 2026, with an Adjusted EBITDA forecast of $160 million to $170 million, implying a worthwhile margin on a full-year basis. The company's ability to consistently generate profits and positive cash flow over a full fiscal year, particularly in its core segment, supports the conclusion of worthwhile margins.
**Answer:** Yes

### **6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement through disciplined cost management and restructuring. In the Q3 2025 earnings call, the CEO highlighted that improved operating results were driven by a "reduction in discretionary overhead expenses." For fiscal 2026, the company is targeting adjusted EBITDA growth of approximately $20 million, "mainly driven by disciplined cost management and restructuring initiatives." Specific actions include severance expenses related to cost-saving initiatives in both the Entertainment segment and corporate overhead. These actions demonstrate a clear and ongoing effort to improve profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### **7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific disclosure in the recent SEC filings or earnings call transcripts that provides sufficient evidence to conclude that labor and personnel relations are "outstanding." The filings contain standard language about employees and do not mention any specific programs, metrics (like turnover or engagement scores), or recent labor disputes. While the absence of negative reports is a positive sign, it does not meet Fisher's high bar of demonstrating outstanding relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### **8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, led by President and CEO Peter Warwick, appears stable and presents a unified message in public communications like the Q3 2025 earnings call. There have been no reports of significant executive turnover or public disputes. However, there is a lack of specific information in the provided documents regarding succession planning or other indicators of "outstanding" long-term executive harmony and depth. The information available supports competence and stability, but not necessarily the exceptional quality Fisher's point requires.
**Answer:** No

### **9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public presentations feature the CEO, Peter Warwick, and the CFO, Haji Glover, who articulate the company's strategy and results. The company's segment reporting structure implies there are leaders for Children's Book Publishing and Distribution, Education Solutions, Entertainment, and International, but they are not prominently featured in the reviewed investor materials. The recent acquisition of 9 Story Media has brought in new management for the Entertainment segment. While the top-level management appears capable, the provided sources do not offer enough detail on the breadth and depth of the next tier of operational leaders to confidently assess management depth as being outstanding.
**Answer:** No

### **10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's SEC filings are detailed and provide clear segment-level revenue and operating income breakdowns, allowing for analysis of business unit performance. The Q3 2025 10-Q includes a statement from the CEO and CFO concluding that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of February 28, 2025. There have been no recent restatements or public announcements of material weaknesses in internal controls. This consistent and compliant reporting suggests the company has good and reliable cost analysis and accounting controls in place.
**Answer:** Yes

### **11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Scholastic's direct-to-school sales channel, particularly its Book Fairs, is a unique and powerful competitive advantage in the children's publishing industry. This channel provides unparalleled access to children, parents, and teachers, creating a trusted purchasing environment that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's ability to run approximately 90,000 fairs in a single fiscal year demonstrates a logistical and relationship-based moat. Furthermore, its ownership of iconic intellectual property, such as *Harry Potter* (publishing rights), *The Hunger Games*, and *Clifford the Big Red Dog*, provides a durable content advantage that fuels its publishing, education, and now entertainment segments.
**Answer:** Yes

### **12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions suggest a balance between near-term performance and long-term investment. The acquisition of 9 Story Media Group, funded by taking on $275 million in debt, is a clear long-range strategic move to build out its Entertainment segment and leverage its IP. This investment temporarily increased interest expense and impacted short-term profitability. Similarly, the continued investment in new products for the struggling Education Solutions segment, set to launch in the next school year, demonstrates a willingness to invest through a downturn for future recovery. However, the company also emphasizes short-term measures like "disciplined cost management" and share buybacks, indicating a dual focus. The significant long-term investments slightly outweigh the short-term focus.
**Answer:** Yes

### **13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, and management is actively anti-dilutive. As of February 28, 2025, the company had $94.7 million in cash and access to a $400 million credit facility. Instead of issuing shares, Scholastic has a robust share repurchase program. In fiscal 2025, the company returned over $92 million to shareholders, repurchasing nearly 3.5 million shares, which represented 11% of shares outstanding net of issuances. On March 19, 2025, the board increased its share repurchase authorization to $100 million. This consistent and significant buyback activity demonstrates a clear commitment to reducing share count, not diluting it.
**Answer:** Yes

### **14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates reasonable candor in its communications. In the Q3 2025 results, CEO Peter Warwick acknowledged "increasing pressure on spending by families and schools" and "softness in the retail book market." He also directly addressed the slowdown in the Education Solutions segment and delays in production greenlights for the Entertainment segment. The company also narrowed its full-year guidance downward, reflecting these challenges, which is a sign of transparency. This willingness to discuss both positive and negative factors openly suggests management is candid with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

### **15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags regarding management's integrity in the reviewed documents. The company files its financial reports on time, the auditor's opinion is clean, and the CEO and CFO certify the effectiveness of internal controls. There are no mentions of major legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions that raise concerns, or governance red flags in the Q3 2025 10-Q. While this point is difficult to confirm absolutely from public documents alone, the absence of any negative indicators supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Scholastic Corporation presents a mixed but generally solid profile against Fisher's 15 points. The company's strongest positives are its unique competitive position through its school-based sales channels, its portfolio of valuable intellectual property, its commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and its solid financial controls and management integrity. The primary negatives and areas of concern center on its modest growth prospects in a mature market, the current underperformance of its Education Solutions segment, and a lack of clear evidence for outstanding management depth and labor relations. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the performance of the newly acquired 9 Story business and its ability to successfully leverage Scholastic's IP into a high-growth Entertainment segment, and the success of the new product launches aimed at turning around the Education Solutions division. A successful turnaround in Education Solutions would flip the "No" on the sales organization (Point 4) to a "Yes," while strong, profitable growth from the Entertainment segment could change the calculus for its long-runway potential (Point 1).

fisher score is 9 / 15
