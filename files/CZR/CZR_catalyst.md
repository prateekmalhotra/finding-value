### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

#### **1. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program**

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On October 2, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a $500 million common stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $450 million remained available for repurchases under this program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** The 2024 Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. Given the authorization date, the bulk of the repurchases are expected within the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $150 million of stock.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $300 million of stock.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company utilizes the full remaining $450 million for repurchases.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-10%). This is based on the remaining authorization representing a small percentage of the company's market capitalization.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a history of share repurchases and has already begun utilizing the 2024 program.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must have sufficient cash flow and be in compliance with its debt covenants to execute the repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K for disclosures on share repurchase activity.
    *   Company press releases announcing repurchase activity.
    *   Changes in the number of outstanding shares reported in SEC filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business could lead to the suspension of the program.
    *   The company may choose to use its cash for other purposes, such as debt reduction or acquisitions.
    *   The stock price could increase to a level where management no longer views it as an attractive use of cash.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of share repurchases in the coming quarters.

#### **2. Catalyst Title: Growth in Caesars Digital**

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Caesars Digital segment, which includes sports betting and iGaming, has shown significant growth. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the segment's net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA improved significantly.
*   **Mechanism:** Continued growth in the high-margin digital business will improve the company's overall profitability and cash flow. As the digital segment becomes a larger portion of the company's business, it could lead to a re-rating of the company's valuation multiple.
*   **Timing:** The growth of the digital segment is ongoing. New state launches and product offerings are expected in the near term.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The digital segment's net revenue growth slows to 10% year-over-year.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The digital segment's net revenue grows by 20% year-over-year, in line with the growth seen in 2024.
    *   **High Scenario:** The digital segment's net revenue growth accelerates to 30% due to new state launches and increased market share.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). Continued strong growth in the digital segment could lead to a significant increase in the company's overall valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The digital gaming market is still in a high-growth phase, and Caesars is a major player.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   The legalization of sports betting and iGaming in new states.
    *   The company's ability to compete effectively in the digital marketplace.
    *   Continued consumer adoption of online gaming.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly earnings reports for the Caesars Digital segment's net revenues, Adjusted EBITDA, and key metrics such as sports betting handle and iGaming handle.
    *   Announcements of new state launches for sports betting and iGaming.
    *   Market share data for the digital gaming industry.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Increased competition in the digital gaming space could lead to lower margins.
    *   Regulatory changes in existing markets could negatively impact the business.
    *   A slowdown in the legalization of online gaming in new states.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The digital segment represents a significant growth opportunity for the company.

#### **3. Catalyst Title: New Property Openings and Renovations**

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company recently opened two new properties: Caesars Virginia on December 17, 2024, and Harrah's Columbus, Nebraska, on May 17, 2024. The company also completed the rebranding of Harrah's New Orleans to Caesars New Orleans in October 2024.
*   **Mechanism:** The new properties and renovated facilities will contribute to revenue and earnings growth. The ramp-up of these new properties should provide a tailwind to the company's financial results in the coming year.
*   **Timing:** The financial impact of the new properties will be seen in the company's financial results over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The new properties underperform expectations, contributing less than $50 million in incremental Adjusted EBITDA.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The new properties meet expectations, contributing $75-100 million in incremental Adjusted EBITDA.
    *   **High Scenario:** The new properties exceed expectations, contributing over $125 million in incremental Adjusted EBITDA.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-10%). The new properties are relatively small in the context of the company's overall portfolio.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The properties are now open, and the primary risk is the level of customer demand.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   The new properties must be able to attract a sufficient number of customers.
    *   The company must be able to manage the costs of operating the new properties effectively.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly earnings reports for disclosures on the performance of the new properties.
    *   Local gaming market data for Virginia and Nebraska.
    *   Customer reviews and feedback on the new properties.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The new properties may not generate the expected level of revenue and earnings.
    *   The new properties could cannibalize revenue from the company's other properties in the region.
    *   An economic downturn could negatively impact demand at the new properties.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the performance of the new properties in the coming quarters.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

#### **1. Catalyst Title: Deleveraging and Debt Reduction**

*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a significant amount of debt, with $12.3 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2024. Management has stated that debt reduction is a priority.
*   **Mechanism:** As the company reduces its debt, its interest expense will decrease, which will lead to higher net income and cash flow. A lower level of debt will also reduce the company's financial risk, which could lead to a higher valuation multiple.
*   **Timing:** Debt reduction is an ongoing process. Significant progress is expected over the next 12-60 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company reduces its debt by $1 billion over the next five years.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company reduces its debt by $2-3 billion over the next five years.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company reduces its debt by more than $4 billion over the next five years.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). A significant reduction in debt could lead to a substantial re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. Management has a stated goal of reducing debt, and the company is generating significant cash flow.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   The company must continue to generate strong cash flow.
    *   The company must be able to refinance its debt on favorable terms.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly and annual reports for disclosures on the company's debt levels.
    *   Credit rating agency reports on the company.
    *   Interest expense in the company's income statement.

    *   Rising interest rates could make it more expensive to refinance debt.
    *   The company may choose to use its cash for other purposes, such as acquisitions or share repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. Deleveraging is a key long-term catalyst for the stock.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Caesars Entertainment are moderately positive.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A significant economic downturn:** A recession would likely lead to a decrease in consumer discretionary spending, which would negatively impact all of Caesars' businesses.
2.  **Increased competition in the digital gaming market:** The online gaming market is highly competitive, and increased competition could lead to lower margins and slower growth for Caesars Digital.
3.  **A failure to effectively manage the company's debt load:** If the company is unable to reduce its debt and/or refinance its debt on favorable terms, it could face financial distress.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**
