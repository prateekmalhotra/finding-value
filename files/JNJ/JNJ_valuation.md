### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Δ in Working Capital

| Equity Risk Premium (ERP)| 5.00% | Standard market premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Levered Beta (β) | 0.40 | 5-Year monthly beta, reflecting lower volatility than the overall market, typical for a large, stable healthcare firm. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = FCFF\_Y5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Calculation:** $25,548 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.0582 - 0.025) = $789,956 M
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT ($27,951M) + D&A ($9,144M) = $37,095M
    *   A conservative 10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple for JNJ is ~12.0x.
    *   **Implied Terminal Value:** $37,095M * 12.0 = $445,140M
    *   The Exit Multiple method yields a significantly more conservative Terminal Value. Therefore, the lower value will be used in the base case.

**Selected Terminal Value:** **$445,140 M**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Litigation:** Ongoing talc and other product liability lawsuits remain a significant overhang, with the potential for large cash outflows not modeled in this base case.
2.  **Pharmaceutical Patent Expirations:** The loss of exclusivity for key drugs like Stelara creates revenue headwinds that must be offset by new product launches and acquisitions.
3.  **Regulatory & Pricing Pressure:** As a global healthcare leader, JNJ is exposed to regulatory changes and government-led drug pricing negotiations, which could compress future margins.
4.  **Integration Risk:** The success of recent large acquisitions (e.g., Shockwave) is not guaranteed, and failure to realize synergies could impair value.

final answer is 167.72 $
