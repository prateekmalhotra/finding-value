Of course. I have reviewed the provided valuation of Academy Sports and Outdoors, Inc. (ASO). It is a well-structured and detailed analysis. However, as you pointed out, several key assumptions lean heavily towards a conservative bias, particularly concerning revenue growth and the terminal value.

The following is a revised valuation that adjusts these assumptions to be more in line with the company's strategic plans and market realities, aiming for a "just right" base-case scenario. The original format and information have been preserved, with changes and their rationales clearly noted.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

*(This section is unchanged as it accurately deconstructs the market price based on the provided data.)*

This section deconstructs the market's current valuation to understand the growth and profitability expectations embedded in the stock price.

**A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $55.10 (August 24, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months - TTM):**

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,056 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Gross Margin | 34.1% | $2,065 / $6,056; StockAnalysis.com. |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $615 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Net Income | $440 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $161 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $28 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Capital Expenditures | ($201) | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Change in Working Capital | ($19) | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Interest Expense | $51 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ending Q1 2025. |
| Cash & Equivalents | $401 | StockAnalysis.com, as of May 3, 2025. |
| Total Debt | $1,202 | StockAnalysis.com, as of May 3, 2025. |
| Diluted Shares | 78.1 | StockAnalysis.com, as of May 3, 2025. |

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of $55.10 (an equity value of $4,304 million), the market must be pricing in a specific set of future performance assumptions.

*   **Market-Implied Assumptions:** Assuming a stable TTM operating margin of 10.1% ($615M / $6,056M) and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, the model requires a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 5.5%** to arrive at the current market price.

This analysis answers the question: "What does one have to believe to justify today's stock price?" The answer is a belief in a sustained re-acceleration of growth to 5.5% annually for the next five years while maintaining current profitability.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation from the ground up, adjusting key assumptions from the original analysis to better reflect the company's growth strategy and industry norms.

**C) Formulate Realistic Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue for Years 1–5:**
    *   **Original Assumption:** 2.0% CAGR.
    *   **Revised Assumption:** **3.5% annual growth rate for the next five years.**
    *   **Rationale for Change:** The 2.0% assumption was overly conservative. Management's plan to open 15-17 new stores per year represents a ~5.5% annual increase in store count. A 3.5% revenue growth rate more realistically balances this new store unit growth with a conservative assumption of slightly negative comparable store sales (approx. -2.0%) due to the "softness in consumer demand" noted. This is a more balanced view than assuming almost no net growth from the expansion plan.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Original Assumption:** 10.0% operating margin.
    *   **Revised Assumption:** Stable operating margin of **10.1%** (equal to TTM).
    *   **Rationale for Change:** While competitive pressures are real, assuming a decline from the current TTM margin is pessimistic. A base case should assume management can maintain current levels of profitability as they execute their strategy. Holding the margin stable at 10.1% is a more neutral and realistic starting point.
*   **Taxes:** *(Unchanged)* The **24.0% effective tax rate** is a sound assumption.
*   **Capital Intensity:** *(Unchanged)* Capex of **$300 million annually** aligns with management's guidance for store expansion. Change in working capital as **1.0% of incremental revenue** remains a reasonable projection.
*   **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:** *(Unchanged)* Projecting **$30 million in SBC** and a **net annual share reduction of 2.5%** appropriately models company policy and historical action.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,268 | $6,487 | $6,714 | $6,949 | $7,192 |
| EBIT (10.1% margin) | $633 | $655 | $678 | $702 | $726 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 0.76) | $481 | $498 | $515 | $533 | $552 |
| Add: D&A | $165 | $170 | $175 | $180 | $185 |
| Less: Stock-Based Comp | ($30) | ($30) | ($30) | ($30) | ($30) |
| Less: Capex | ($300) | ($300) | ($300) | ($300) | ($300) |
| Less: Change in WC | ($2) | ($2) | ($2) | ($2) | ($2) |
| **Free Cash Flow to Firm** | **$314** | **$336** | **$358** | **$381** | **$405** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.25%
    *   Equity Risk Premium (ERP): 5.0%
    *   **Beta (β): 1.50** (Revised from 1.65).
    *   **Rationale for Change:** A beta of 1.65 is on the high end for a specialty retailer. A beta of 1.50 is still well above the market average, reflecting consumer cyclicality, but is more in line with industry peers and less punitive, creating a more realistic cost of capital.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.50 * 5.0% = **11.75%***
*   **Cost of Debt:** *(Unchanged)* *After-tax Cost of Debt = **3.2%***
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: $4,304 million.
    *   Market Value of Debt: $1,202 million.
    *   Total Capital: $5,506 million.
    *   *WACC = (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd) = (78.2% * 11.75%) + (21.8% * 3.2%) = **9.88%** (rounded to **9.9%**)*

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Method Change:** From Gordon Growth to **Exit Multiple Method.**
*   **Rationale for Change:** The original cross-check correctly identified that the Gordon Growth method produced a conservative implied EV/EBITDA multiple of 5.4x, at the low end of the historical range. For a company with a clear expansion runway, using a mid-cycle multiple is more appropriate. The Exit Multiple method provides a more direct, market-based valuation for the terminal year.
*   **Exit Multiple Calculation:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $726M + $185M = $911M.
    *   Exit Multiple: **6.5x EV/EBITDA**. This multiple sits comfortably in the middle of ASO's historical 4x-8x range and is reasonable for a specialty retailer with moderate growth and solid margins.
    *   *Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $911M * 6.5 = **$5,922 million***
*   **Implied Growth Rate Cross-Check:**
    *   A terminal value of $5,922M implies a perpetual growth rate (g) of:
    *   *g = (WACC * TV - FCFF_Year5) / (TV + FCFF_Year5) = (9.9% * $5,922 - $405) / ($5,922 + $405) = **2.8%***
    *   This implied growth rate of 2.8% is still reasonable and aligns with long-term economic growth + inflation, confirming that the 6.5x multiple is not overly aggressive.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: $314/1.099^1 + $336/1.099^2 + $358/1.099^3 + $381/1.099^4 + $405/1.099^5 = $1,475 million.
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $5,922 / 1.099^5 = $3,695 million.
    *   *Total EV = $1,475 million + $3,695 million = **$5,170 million***
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $1,202M - $401M = $801 million.
    *   *Equity Value = $5,170 million - $801 million = **$4,369 million***

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Share Count:** *(Unchanged)*
    *   Starting Shares: 78.1 million.
    *   *Year 5 Diluted Shares = 78.1 * (1 - 0.025)^5 = **68.8 million shares***
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Fair Value = $4,369 million / 68.8 million shares = **$63.50 per share***
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $63.50.** Assumes 3.5% revenue growth and 10.1% operating margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $45.00.** Assumes 1.0% revenue growth and margin compression to 9.0% as expansion stalls and competition intensifies.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $80.00.** Assumes 5.0% revenue growth (strong comps + new stores) and margin expansion to 11.0% driven by operational excellence.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety below the base-case fair value is desired.
    *   *MOS Price = $63.50 * (1 - 0.30) = **$44.45***

### **Risk Notes**

*(These risks from the original analysis remain highly relevant and are unchanged.)*

1.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** ASO's results are highly sensitive to the health of the consumer. A prolonged economic downturn could significantly impact sales and profitability.
2.  **Competitive Pressures:** The sporting goods retail market is intensely competitive, with pressure from larger rivals (like Dick's Sporting Goods), mass-market retailers (Walmart, Target), and online specialists.
3.  **Inventory Management:** Failure to manage inventory effectively in response to shifting consumer trends can lead to markdowns and margin erosion.
4.  **Store Expansion Risk:** The company's growth strategy relies heavily on opening new stores. Poor site selection or local economic weakness could lead to underperforming new locations.

final answer is 63.50 $
