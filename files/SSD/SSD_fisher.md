**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong product development, a robust sales organization, and healthy profit margins. The company demonstrates a long-term outlook through consistent investment in R&D and capital expenditures. Its financial position is solid, with strong cash flow and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. The primary area for improvement is in labor relations, given that a portion of the workforce is unionized and contracts will require renegotiation. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful negotiation of collective bargaining agreements, the continued successful integration of recent acquisitions, and the company's ability to maintain its strong margins in the face of potential economic headwinds in the housing market. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with the successful and amicable renegotiation of union contracts.

fisher score is 14 / 15
