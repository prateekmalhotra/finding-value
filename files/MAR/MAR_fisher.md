### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Marriott's key competitive advantages are its powerful brand portfolio, its massive and growing loyalty program, and its extensive global footprint.

Synthesis: Marriott International scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong brand portfolio, asset-light business model, and experienced management team. The primary areas of strength are its long runway for growth, commitment to development, and strong financial position. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12–24 months by the company's ability to navigate the evolving travel landscape, including potential economic headwinds and changing consumer preferences. The "No" for labor relations could flip to a "Yes" with evidence of improved employee satisfaction metrics and a reduction in labor-related risks.
