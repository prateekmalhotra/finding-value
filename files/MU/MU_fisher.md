### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Micron's management has a track record of open communication during both good and bad times. Throughout the severe industry downturn of 2023, earnings calls featured management openly discussing the challenges of oversupply, inventory write-downs, and the painful but necessary steps of reducing production and capital spending. This is contrasted with the current optimistic, but still detailed, commentary on the AI-led recovery. This consistency in communication fosters credibility.

Synthesis:
Micron scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strengths in technology leadership, a long-range investment horizon, and financial stability. The company's future is tightly linked to powerful secular trends in AI, data centers, and automotive, and its R&D effectiveness is evident in its market-leading HBM and advanced manufacturing nodes. The primary weaknesses in this analysis stem from a lack of verifiable, public evidence for "outstanding" performance in its sales organization and labor relations, rather than evidence of significant problems. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two factors: the sustainability of the AI-driven demand for HBM, which underpins the margin recovery story, and the company's execution on its technology roadmap for the next generation of DRAM and NAND. A "No" on profit margins could re-emerge if the industry cycle turns downward unexpectedly.

fisher score is 13 / 15
