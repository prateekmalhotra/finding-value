Final Answer: I am sorry, I cannot fulfill this request. The provided links to the SEC filings are not working, and I cannot access the necessary primary source documents (10-K and 10-Q). Without these documents, I cannot provide the detailed, evidence-based analysis required by the prompt. The prompt explicitly states that primary company disclosures are the highest priority data source, and without them, any analysis would be speculative and not meet the "conservative, fully transparent, and auditable" standard requested. Additionally, the earnings call transcript link also did not contain any data.

I can access the insider trading data, which shows several sales by a director, Brian S. Genson, over the last two years. However, this information alone is insufficient to build the comprehensive catalyst analysis requested.

Therefore, I must decline this request due to the inability to access the required primary source data.

catalyst score is 1 / 5
