### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Key guidance from the Q2 2024 earnings call:

*   **Full-Year 2024 Adjusted EBITDA:** "we expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA margins in the 19% to 20% range and expect to deliver adjusted EBITDA in the range of $1.73 billion to $1.83 billion." (Q2 2024 Earnings Call, July 30, 2024)
*   **Volume Outlook:** "Overall volumes were flat, in line with our expectation of flat to slightly positive" (Q2 2024 Earnings Call, July 30, 2024)

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year)**

| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | **2.0% annually.** With volumes expected to be "flat to slightly positive," a conservative 2.0% growth rate is assumed, driven by price/mix. This is below recent historical averages to reflect a normalized environment. | (Q2 2024 Earnings Call, July 30, 2024) |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **13.0% of Revenue.** This is slightly below the TTM margin of 11.93% and in line with management's target of 19-20% adjusted EBITDA margins. | (Q2 2024 Earnings Call, July 30, 2024) |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **25.0%.** Aligns with the TTM effective tax rate of 25.21%. | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **6.0%.** Consistent with the TTM average of 6.07% ($524M / $8,635M). | (Calculation from Baseline Financials) |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.3%.** Consistent with the TTM average of 0.28% ($24M / $8,635M). | (Calculation from Baseline Financials) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **12.0%.** Below the TTM of 13.5% ($1,164M/$8,635M) which was elevated due to a new facility. A normalized rate is assumed. | (Author's estimate based on historicals) |
| **Change in WC as % of Incr. Revenue** | **10.0%.** Based on historical averages. | (Author's estimate based on historicals) |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.5%.** Reflects long-term inflation expectations and a mature industry. | (Author's estimate) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity), making it independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $8,807.7 | $8,983.9 | $9,163.5 | $9,346.8 | $9,533.7 |
| EBIT (13.0%) | $1,145.0 | $1,167.9 | $1,191.3 | $1,215.1 | $1,239.4 |
| NOPAT | $858.8 | $875.9 | $893.4 | $911.3 | $929.5 |
| D&A | $528.5 | $539.0 | $549.8 | $560.8 | $572.0 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($26.4) | ($26.9) | ($27.5) | ($28.0) | ($28.6) |

| Change in WC | ($17.3) | ($17.6) | ($18.0) | ($18.3) | ($18.7) |
| **FCFF** | **$286.5** | **$292.3** | **$298.1** | **$304.1** | **$310.2** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value/Calculation | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.30% | (US 10 Year Treasury, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | (Standard market assumption) |
| Beta | 0.73 | (MarketBeat, Aug 21, 2025) |
| *Cost of Equity* | *4.30% + 0.73 * 5.00% = **7.95%*** | |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Interest Expense / Total Debt | $215M / $5,871M = **3.66%** | (Calculation from Baseline Financials) |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 3.66% * (1 - 0.25) = **2.75%** | |
| **WACC** | | |
| Market Cap (Equity) | $6,670M | (MarketBeat, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt | $5,871M | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| *WACC* | *(6,670/12,541)*7.95% + *(5,871/12,541)*2.75% = **5.52%*** | |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal FCFF (Year 6) = $310.2M * (1 + 2.5%) = $317.96M
    *   Terminal Value = $317.96M / (5.52% - 2.5%) = **$10,528.4M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $1,239.4M + $572.0M = $1,811.4M
    *   Assuming a conservative 7.0x EV/EBITDA multiple (in-line with historical averages), Terminal Value = $1,811.4M * 7.0 = **$12,679.8M**
    *   The Gordon Growth method results in a more conservative terminal value and will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF | $1,343.8 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $8,024.1 |

| **High/Bull Case (+4.0% growth, 14% EBIT margin)** | **$15.25** |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Base)** | **$8.37** |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Input Cost Volatility:** The company is exposed to fluctuations in raw material and energy prices, which could compress margins if not passed through to customers.
2.  **Consumer Demand:** A significant portion of revenue is tied to consumer staples, but a prolonged economic downturn could still impact volumes and product mix.
3.  **Integration Risk:** The company has a history of acquisitions. Future M&A carries integration risk and could disrupt operations.
4.  **Capital Intensity:** The business requires significant capital expenditures for maintenance and growth projects. Misallocation of capital or project delays could negatively impact returns.
