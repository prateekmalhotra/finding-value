The company also generates strong cash flow from operations, which was $206.4 million in 2024.

**Synthesis:**
Alarm.com scores well on the Fisher checklist, with many positive attributes. The company's strongest points are its large and growing market opportunity, its strong competitive position, its profitable and scalable business model, and its strong financial position. The two areas where the company scores a "No" are due to a lack of publicly available information, rather than any known issues. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to successfully expand into international markets and the commercial sector. To change the "No" scores to "Yes", more information would be needed on the company's labor relations and the depth of its management team.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
