Synthesis: Allison Transmission scores highly on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its product development, financial strength, and management quality. The company's commitment to innovation in electric propulsion systems is a key driver for future growth. The primary variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the pace of adoption of electric commercial vehicles and Allison's ability to maintain its market leadership in this new technology. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosures on employee satisfaction and turnover, or a new long-term labor agreement that is viewed as favorable by both the company and its employees.

fisher score is 14 / 15
