### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Key guidance from the Q2 2025 earnings call on July 29, 2025:

*   **Full-Year Transaction Margin (TM) Dollars:** "For the full year, we now expect TM dollars to be between $15.35 billion and $15.5 billion, which represents 5% to 6% growth." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2025)
*   **Q3 TM Dollars:** "We expect third quarter TM dollars to be between $3.76 billion and $3.82 billion, which represents 4% growth at the midpoint." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2025)
*   **Branded Checkout Growth:** "Branded experiences TPV, which includes online checkout, PayPal and Venmo debit, as well as Tap to Pay, posted another quarter of 8% growth." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2025)
*   **Venmo Growth:** "Venmo TPV increased 12%, its highest rate of growth in 3 years." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2025)

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1:** 5.5%. This is based on the midpoint of management's full-year guidance for transaction margin dollar growth (5-6%), which is a close proxy for revenue growth. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Jul 29, 2025)
    *   **Years 2-5:** The growth rate is projected to gradually decline from 5.5% to 4.0% over the forecast horizon. This reflects a blend of strong performance in areas like Venmo and BNPL, offset by the law of large numbers and persistent competition in the digital payments space.
*   **Operating Margin:**
    *   The model assumes a stable TTM operating margin of **18.72%** throughout the forecast period. (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) While management is focused on profitable growth, no specific margin expansion targets were provided. To maintain a realistic, evidence-based forecast, margins are held constant.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   The effective tax rate is assumed to be **21.5%**. This is based on the average effective tax rate over the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024), normalizing for anomalies. (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed to be **2.4% of revenue**, consistent with the TTM average (774M / 32,292M). (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeled as **-5.5% of incremental revenue**, based on the TTM Change in WC / TTM Revenue Growth. This negative change indicates efficient working capital management. (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is treated as a real cash expense. It is projected at **3.4% of revenue**, in line with the TTM average (1,102M / 32,292M). (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   The final share count used is **1,003 million** diluted shares. (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in WC

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 34,068 | 35,772 | 37,372 | 38,867 | 40,422 |
| *Growth Rate* | *5.50%* | *5.00%* | *4.48%* | *4.00%* | *4.00%* |
| EBIT (18.72% Margin) | 6,378 | 6,697 | 6,997 | 7,277 | 7,568 |
| Tax on EBIT (21.5%) | (1,371) | (1,440) | (1,504) | (1,564) | (1,627) |
| **NOPAT** | **5,007** | **5,258** | **5,493** | **5,713** | **5,941** |
| D&A | 531 | 557 | 583 | 606 | 630 |
| Stock-Based Comp | (1,158) | (1,216) | (1,271) | (1,321) | (1,374) |
| Capex | (818) | (859) | (897) | (933) | (970) |
| Change in WC | 98 | 94 | 88 | 80 | 80 |
| **FCFF** | **2,860** | **2,834** | **2,995** | **3,144** | **3,307** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.33%**, based on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield. (Trading Economics, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**. This is a standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta (Î²):** **1.36**. The 5-year monthly beta reflects the stock's higher-than-market volatility, which is reasonable for a technology-driven financial services company subject to competitive and macroeconomic pressures. (TradingView, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.33% + 1.36 * 5.0% = 11.13%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-tax Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt = 420M / 12,172M = **3.45%**. (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.45% * (1 - 21.5%) = **2.71%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity = 67.68 \* 1,003M shares = 67,883M. (TradingView, Aug 22, 2025; StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Market Value of Debt = 12,172M (using book value as proxy). (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   **WACC = (67,883 / 80,055) * 11.13% + (12,172 / 80,055) * 2.71% = 9.85%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation and global economic growth expectations.
    *   Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Value = (3,307 \* 1.025) / (9.85% - 2.5%) = **46,120M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   EBITDA Year 5 = EBIT Year 5 + D&A Year 5 = 7,568M + 630M = 8,198M.
    *   The 5-year median EV/EBITDA multiple for PayPal has been approximately **16.0x**. (Investing.com, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Terminal Value (Multiple) = 8,198M \* 16.0 = **131,168M**.
    *   **Decision:** There is a significant discrepancy. The lower, more conservative Gordon Growth terminal value of **$46,120M** will be used for the base-case valuation.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   PV of Explicit FCFF = (2,860/1.0985^1) + (2,834/1.0985^2) + (2,995/1.0985^3) + (3,144/1.0985^4) + (3,307/1.0985^5) = **11,438M**
*   PV of Terminal Value = 46,120 / (1.0985^5) = **28,812M**
*   **Enterprise Value (EV) = 11,438M + 28,812M = 40,250M**
*   Less: Net Debt = Total Debt (12,172M) - Cash (6,688M) = 5,484M. (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
*   **Equity Value = 40,250M - 5,484M = 34,766M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $34,766M / 1,003M shares = $34.66**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $34.66**. Assumes 5.5% fading to 4.0% revenue growth and stable 18.7% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$27.00**. Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 3-4%) and margin compression to ~17.5% due to competition and macro headwinds.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$45.00**. Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 6-7%) and modest margin expansion to ~20.0% from successful new product rollouts and cost discipline.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a target purchase price.
    *   **MOS Price = $34.66 \* (1 - 0.30) = $24.26**

### **One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include intense competition from players like Apple, Google, and traditional financial institutions, which could compress margins and slow growth. Regulatory changes in the rapidly evolving fintech landscape could impose additional costs or restrictions. The company's performance is also highly sensitive to global consumer spending and macroeconomic conditions, which can impact transaction volumes. Execution risk on new initiatives, such as the rollout of PayPal World and AI-driven services, is significant; failure to gain traction could lead to slower growth than anticipated. Lastly, the high stock-based compensation remains a drag on free cash flow available to shareholders.

final answer is 34.66 $
