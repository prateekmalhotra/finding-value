### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program Execution**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a Board-authorized stock repurchase program for up to $100.0 million of its common stock, effective through July 31, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, $29.7 million remained available for repurchases under this program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share, assuming all other factors remain constant. A lower share count can lead to a higher stock price as the market re-rates the stock based on improved per-share metrics.
*   **Timing:** August 23, 2025 – July 31, 2026. The current authorization expires July 31, 2025, and a new authorization is possible.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company repurchases $15 million of stock at an average price of $45/share (~333,333 shares).
    *   **Base Case:** The company repurchases the remaining $29.7 million authorized at an average price of $45/share (~660,000 shares).
    *   **High Case:** The company repurchases the remaining $29.7 million and authorizes and repurchases an additional $20 million, for a total of $49.7 million at an average price of $45/share (~1,104,444 shares).
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). This is based on the potential for a 1-3% reduction in shares outstanding and the positive signal of management's view of undervaluation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a consistent history of share repurchases.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The stock price remaining at a level management deems attractive for repurchases. No major negative changes in the company's financial position or outlook.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K for "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
    *   Press releases announcing new or expanded repurchase authorizations.
    *   Daily trading volume and price.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   A deterioration in the company's financial performance or a need to conserve capital for other purposes could halt the program.
    *   The market may not react positively to the repurchases if they are seen as a lack of better investment opportunities.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases as an indicator of management's confidence in the current stock valuation.

**2. Catalyst Title: Insider Purchases Signal Confidence**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** There have been recent open-market purchases of EIG stock by insiders, including the company's EVP and CFO, Michael Pedraja, who purchased 5,000 shares on August 5, 2025, and 3,050 shares on May 6, 2025.
*   **Mechanism:** Insider purchases are often seen by the market as a strong signal that the company's management believes the stock is undervalued. This can increase investor confidence and attract new buyers, leading to an increase in the stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 23, 2025 – February 23, 2026. The impact of insider purchases is typically most pronounced in the weeks and months following the transactions.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** No further insider purchases.
    *   **Base Case:** One or two additional small-to-medium-sized purchases by other executives or directors.
    *   **High Case:** Multiple significant purchases by several insiders, including the CEO.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (1-3%). Insider purchases are a positive signal but are unlikely to have a large, direct impact on the stock price unless they are very large or widespread.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. Recent purchases suggest a positive sentiment among insiders, and it is plausible that more could follow.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Insiders having the personal financial capacity and the belief that the stock is undervalued to make additional purchases. No negative developments that would change insider sentiment.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   SEC Form 4 filings on OpenInsider or the SEC's EDGAR database.
    *   The size and price of insider purchases.
    *   The number of different insiders buying stock.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Insider selling could negate the positive signal from recent purchases.
    *   The market may ignore the insider purchases if there are overriding negative concerns about the company or the market in general.
    *   The purchases may be for personal financial planning reasons rather than a signal of undervaluation.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Continued insider buying would strengthen the investment thesis.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Special Dividend Declaration**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a history of paying special dividends, with the last one paid in 2022. The company's strong capital position and consistent profitability could support the declaration of another special dividend in the future.
*   **Mechanism:** A special dividend provides a direct return of capital to shareholders, which can make the stock more attractive to income-oriented investors. It can also be a signal that management believes the company has excess capital that cannot be deployed in value-creating projects, and returning it to shareholders is the best use of that capital.
*   **Timing:** August 2026 – August 2030. The timing of a special dividend is highly discretionary and depends on the company's performance and capital needs.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** A special dividend of $1.00 per share.
    *   **Base Case:** A special dividend of $2.00 per share.
    *   **High Case:** A special dividend of $3.00 per share.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (5-15%). The price impact will depend on the size of the dividend. A significant special dividend can have a material impact on the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The company has a history of paying special dividends, but the timing is uncertain.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong financial performance, a stable or improving capital position, and a lack of large-scale M&A opportunities.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly and annual financial statements for cash flow, net income, and capital levels.
    *   Press releases announcing dividend declarations.
    *   Company presentations and earnings calls for discussions on capital allocation.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant increase in claims or a deterioration in underwriting performance could reduce the company's excess capital.
    *   A large acquisition or other investment opportunity could be a better use of capital.
    *   Regulatory changes could require the company to hold more capital.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. A special dividend would be a significant positive catalyst.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Share Repurchase Program Execution**
*   **Formula:** Adjusted EPS = Net Income / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)
*   **Scenario:** If EIG repurchases the remaining $29.7 million under its authorization at an average price of $45 per share, it would retire approximately 660,000 shares.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Shares Outstanding (as of Dec 31, 2024): 24,556,706
    *   Shares Repurchased: 660,000
    *   New Shares Outstanding: 23,896,706
    *   % Reduction in Shares: 2.7%
*   **Valuation Impact:** A 2.7% reduction in shares outstanding would lead to a ~2.7% increase in EPS and book value per share, which could translate to a similar increase in the stock price.

**2. Special Dividend Declaration**
*   **Formula:** Dividend Yield = Special Dividend / Stock Price
*   **Scenario:** If EIG declares a special dividend of $2.00 per share, and the stock price is $45 at the time of the announcement.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Special Dividend Yield = $2.00 / $45.00 = 4.4%
*   **Valuation Impact:** The stock price would likely increase by an amount close to the dividend amount, as the dividend represents a direct return to shareholders. The stock could also see a re-rating due to the signal of strong financial health.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for EIG are generally positive, with a high probability of continued share repurchases and a strong signal from recent insider buying. These catalysts are likely to have a small but positive impact on the stock price in the next 0-12 months. The potential for a special dividend is a significant long-term catalyst that could provide a more substantial boost to the stock price if it materializes. Overall, the short-term market signal is positive, but not overwhelmingly so.

### **9) Evidence Matrix (required)**

| Citation | Claim(s) / Field(s) Supported |
| :--- | :--- |

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A major catastrophic event:** A large-scale natural disaster or terrorist attack could lead to a surge in claims that would significantly impact the company's financial position and ability to return capital to shareholders.
2.  **A sharp and sustained economic downturn:** This could lead to a significant increase in unemployment, which would reduce the company's premium income and could also lead to an increase in claims.
3.  **Adverse regulatory changes:** Changes in workers' compensation laws or regulations in key states like California could have a material negative impact on the company's profitability.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

Based on the analysis, the near-term outlook for EIG is positive, supported by a clear commitment to share repurchases and encouraging insider buying. These catalysts could provide a 2-5% upside in the near term. The most important indicator to monitor is the pace of share repurchases reported in the company's quarterly filings, as this will be the most direct measure of management's confidence in the stock's valuation.
