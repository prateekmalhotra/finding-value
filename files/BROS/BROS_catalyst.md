### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Continued Strong Same-Shop Sales Growth:**

*   **Formula:** Change in Revenue = (Company-Operated Revenue \* (1 + Same-Shop Sales Growth)) - Company-Operated Revenue
*   **Base Case (5% growth):** ($381M \* 1.05) - $381M = $19.05M increase in quarterly revenue
*   **High Case (7% growth):** ($381M \* 1.07) - $381M = $26.67M increase in quarterly revenue

**2. Successful New Store Openings and Expansion:**

*   **Formula:** New Store Revenue = Number of New Stores \* AUV
*   **Base Case (160 stores, $2.05M AUV):** 160 \* $2.05M = $328M in annualized revenue
*   **High Case (170 stores, $2.1M AUV):** 170 \* $2.1M = $357M in annualized revenue

2.  **A major food safety incident:** Any issue with the safety or quality of Dutch Bros' products could severely damage the brand's reputation and lead to a loss of customer trust.
3.  **Increased competition from larger players:** While Dutch Bros has a loyal following, increased competition from established coffee chains like Starbucks or Dunkin' could put pressure on pricing and market share.

Dutch Bros is a compelling growth story with multiple near- and long-term catalysts. The company's strong same-shop sales growth and successful expansion strategy are key drivers of its value. We recommend a **Buy** rating with a 12-month price target of $85, representing a significant upside from the current price. The most important indicator to monitor is the company's ability to continue driving transaction growth in its same-shop sales, as this will be a key indicator of its long-term success.
