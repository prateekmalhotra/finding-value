**Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed:** The Walt Disney Company (DIS), August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed include the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 29, 2024, and the Q2 FY25 Earnings Call Transcript from May 7, 2025.

### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Walt Disney Company's growth potential is supported by its diversified segments. The Experiences segment is undergoing significant investment, with plans to invest over $30 billion into its theme parks in Florida and California to enhance offerings. The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) streaming business, particularly Disney+, continues to be a core growth platform, with Disney+ Core subscribers growing to 122.7 million as of September 2024, a 9% increase year-over-year. The upcoming launch of a flagship ESPN direct-to-consumer service in late 2025 is designed to capture the market of sports fans who are not traditional cable subscribers.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is heavily investing in future growth drivers. The company plans to invest over $30 billion in its domestic theme parks and has expansion projects underway globally, including new cruise ships, the Disney Adventure and the Disney Destiny, scheduled for fiscal 2026. In media, the company is preparing for the launch of a new flagship ESPN direct-to-consumer product in the fall of 2025. These significant capital expenditures and strategic initiatives demonstrate a clear commitment to developing new products and experiences to drive future sales.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney does not report a single "R&D" line item; its innovation is embedded within content production and capital expenditures for Parks & Experiences. Walt Disney Imagineering serves as the primary R&D engine for the Experiences segment, creating new attractions and technologies. The effectiveness of its content development is demonstrated by the box office success of films like *Inside Out 2* and the continued growth of its streaming platforms, indicating a strong return on creative investment. The company's ability to create and monetize intellectual property across all its segments is a key indicator of its effective, albeit decentralized, R&D efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's sales organization is multifaceted, encompassing advertising sales, distribution, and consumer-direct transactions. The company's ability to secure broad distribution for its linear networks and DTC services, and its successful negotiation of affiliate agreements, points to a strong sales function. In its DTC business, Disney ended Q2 FY25 with 22.5 million ad-tier subscribers globally, demonstrating effective ad sales and subscriber acquisition strategies. The consistent high attendance and occupancy rates at its parks and resorts also reflect a best-in-class direct-to-consumer sales and marketing engine.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, Disney's income before income taxes was $7.6 billion on $91.4 billion in revenue, yielding a pre-tax margin of approximately 8.3%. While the Entertainment Direct-to-Consumer business has historically incurred losses, it achieved profitability in Q2 2025. The Experiences segment consistently delivers strong margins, with operating income of $9.3 billion on $34.2 billion in revenue (a 27% margin) for fiscal 2024. These results, especially in the established Experiences segment, indicate worthwhile profit margins at the consolidated level, with a clear trajectory for improvement in streaming.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/q2-fy25-earnings-conference-call/](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/q2-fy25-earnings-conference-call/) (May 7, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement through cost controls and strategic pricing. The company has implemented significant cost-saving initiatives and is executing a cost rationalization plan. In the streaming business, Disney is improving margins through price increases and the introduction of ad-supported tiers, which are showing strong subscriber adoption. The Experiences segment is focused on managing costs while using dynamic pricing and premium offerings like Lightning Lane to optimize revenue and margins. These actions have contributed to the entertainment streaming business reaching profitability in Q2 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/q2-fy25-earnings-conference-call/](https://thewaltdisneycompany.com/q2-fy25-earnings-conference-call/) (May 7, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024), [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/07/walt-disney-dis-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/07/walt-disney-dis-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/) (May 7, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of September 28, 2024, Disney employed approximately 233,000 people, with a significant number covered by collective bargaining agreements. While the company invests in employee development through programs like Disney Aspire, it has also faced labor disputes. Fiscal 2023 saw work stoppages by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA, which impacted content production. More recently, in July 2024, SAG-AFTRA commenced a work stoppage against video game employers, which could affect Disney's gaming division. While the company manages a large and complex workforce, the recent high-profile disputes prevent a clear "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent years have seen notable executive turnover and a proxy contest. Robert A. Iger returned as CEO in November 2022, replacing Bob Chapek. Hugh F. Johnston was appointed CFO in December 2023. In early 2024, the company engaged in a proxy contest with Trian Fund Management, which sought board seats. While Disney's management and board nominees ultimately won the shareholder vote, the public nature of the dispute suggests underlying tensions. This recent history of leadership changes and public shareholder disputes points to executive relations that are not currently "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company lists its key executive officers in its annual report, including the CEO, CFO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Human Resources Officer, and Chief Communications Officer. The company is managed through three distinct segments—Entertainment, Sports, and Experiences—each with its own leadership team responsible for its operations. This structure suggests a decentralized management model with leaders in charge of significant business units. However, the recent return of Bob Iger as CEO and the lack of a publicly named successor raise questions about the succession plan and the depth of the bench immediately below the CEO level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's financial reporting is detailed, with segment-level breakdowns of revenues and operating income, providing a clear view of business performance. The company's internal control over financial reporting was deemed effective as of September 28, 2024, and the effectiveness of these controls was audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Management's report on internal controls states they are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or significant accounting issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's key competitive advantage is its unparalleled portfolio of intellectual property (IP) and its ability to monetize that IP across a synergistic ecosystem of movies, streaming, parks, and consumer products. This flywheel effect, where a successful film drives streaming engagement, theme park attendance, and merchandise sales, is unique in the industry. For example, the success of franchises like *Star Wars* and *Marvel* is leveraged across Disney+ content, themed lands at parks (e.g., Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge), and extensive merchandise lines, creating multiple revenue streams from a single creative asset.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney has demonstrated a willingness to make substantial long-term investments, even at the expense of short-term profits. The multi-billion dollar investment in its DTC streaming services, which incurred significant losses for years before reaching profitability, is a prime example. Similarly, the planned $30 billion-plus investment in the Experiences segment over the coming years is a long-term initiative aimed at driving durable growth. Management's commentary consistently emphasizes building for the future and positioning the company for long-term sustainable growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 29, 2024, the company had $6.0 billion in cash and cash equivalents and generated $14.0 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2024. The company has a strong balance sheet and access to capital markets, with committed credit facilities of $12.25 billion. Furthermore, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program in February 2024, and the company repurchased $3.0 billion of its stock in fiscal 2024, signaling confidence in its financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, not diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000232/dis-20240629.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000232/dis-20240629.htm) (filed August 6, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's management communicates regularly with investors through quarterly earnings calls, SEC filings, and investor conferences. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed challenges, such as the expected loss for entertainment DTC in Q3 due to cricket rights and a projected lack of core subscriber growth for Disney+ in the same quarter. The company also provides detailed segment data and key performance indicators, like subscriber counts and average revenue per user, offering transparency into its operations, both positive and negative.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024), [https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/07/walt-disney-dis-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/07/walt-disney-dis-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/) (May 7, 2024)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is a defendant in a private securities class action lawsuit filed in May 2023, alleging misstatements and omissions concerning costs and subscriber growth of Disney+. While the company intends to defend itself vigorously, and the lawsuit is in its early stages, the existence of such litigation regarding financial disclosures raises questions. Without a definitive resolution or finding of wrongdoing, it is difficult to give an unequivocal "Yes." Given the pending legal action concerning disclosures to investors, a conservative assessment is warranted.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1744489/000174448924000276/dis-20240928.htm) (filed November 14, 2024)

---
**Synthesis:**
Disney scores well on its long-term growth prospects, commitment to reinvestment, strong sales and IP monetization, and financial controls. The company's core strengths lie in its powerful brand ecosystem and its willingness to make significant, long-range investments in its Parks and Streaming businesses to ensure future growth. However, the analysis highlights significant weaknesses in management stability and relations, as evidenced by recent leadership turmoil and a proxy contest. Recent labor disputes and a pending securities class action lawsuit also detract from the score. Over the next 12–24 months, the variables most likely to change the score are the successful execution and profitability ramp of the DTC streaming segment, particularly the new ESPN service, and a clear resolution to the CEO succession plan. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on management depth would require the naming of a credible successor to Bob Iger, while improved labor relations would depend on the smooth negotiation of future union contracts without significant work stoppages.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
