### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs' R&D expenses are not explicitly broken out in its financial statements, but are included in SG&A.

### 9) Depth of Management

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs has a well-defined management structure with clear roles and responsibilities for its executive team, as detailed in its 2024 10-K. The company has also demonstrated a commitment to developing talent from within, with several key executives having been with the company for a number of years.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs' key competitive advantage lies in its proprietary Croslite™ material, which provides a unique combination of comfort, lightness, and durability. This material is a trade secret and is a key differentiator for the brand.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a willingness to invest for long-term growth. The acquisition of HEYDUDE in 2022 is a prime example of this, as it diversifies the company's brand portfolio and provides a new avenue for growth. The company is also investing heavily in its digital capabilities and international expansion, particularly in China. While these investments may impact short-term profitability, they are aimed at driving long-term, sustainable growth. In its preliminary 2024 outlook, the company stated its intention to reinvest gross margin improvements into strategic SG&A investments to support long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs has a strong track record of cash flow generation. The company has been actively repurchasing its own shares, which is the opposite of dilutive equity financing. As of June 30, 2024, the company had a significant share repurchase authorization in place. The company's strong balance sheet and access to debt financing should be sufficient to fund its growth initiatives without the need for significant equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Crocs' management team regularly hosts earnings calls and participates in investor conferences, providing detailed updates on the company's performance and outlook. The transcripts of these calls show a willingness to address both positive and negative developments. For instance, the company has been transparent about the challenges it has faced with the HEYDUDE brand, including the recent impairment charges.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of any significant legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of Crocs' management team. The company has a code of ethics in place, and its financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm. While the company is involved in some litigation, as disclosed in its SEC filings, this is normal for a company of its size and does not appear to be indicative of a lack of integrity on the part of management.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**

Crocs scores very highly on the Fisher 15-point checklist, with a perfect score. The company has a strong brand with a loyal customer base and is well-positioned in growing segments of the footwear market. Its innovative products, strong profitability, and experienced management team are all key strengths. The biggest risk to the company's score in the next 12-24 months is the performance of the HEYDUDE brand. The recent impairment charges related to HEYDUDE are a concern, and a continued decline in this brand's performance could lead to a "No" on several of the growth-related points. A successful turnaround of the HEYDUDE brand, on the other hand, would solidify the company's position as a multi-brand powerhouse and further strengthen its investment case. Another factor to watch is the impact of tariffs and the broader macroeconomic environment on consumer spending.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
