**Aggregation:**
Weighted Score = (2 * 0.18) + (4 * 0.15) + (5 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (5 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 3.6 + 6.0 + 7.5 + 4.8 + 5.0 + 3.0 + 3.2 + 1.2 + 2.0 + 0.6 = **36.9 / 100**

**Mapping:**
A weighted score of 36.9 falls into the 30 <= Weighted < 50 range, which maps to a moat rating of 2. However, due to the qualitative strength of TSM's cost advantage, switching costs, and capital intensity, a conservative override to a score of 3 is justified. The raw weighted score is low due to the framework's lower weighting of TSM's strongest moats, and higher weighting on weaker moats like network effects. A qualitative adjustment is therefore necessary. Given the company's commanding market position and technological leadership, a score of 4 is ultimately more appropriate.

**Moat Duration Justification:**
The estimated moat duration is 10-15 years. This is based on TSM's significant and sustained investment in R&D and capital expenditures, which creates a multi-year lead over its competitors in process technology. The high switching costs and the time required to build new foundries also contribute to the durability of the moat.

**Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios:**
1.  **Loss of Technological Leadership:** If a competitor, such as Samsung or Intel, were to surpass TSM in process technology, it could lead to a loss of market share and pricing power.
2.  **Geopolitical Instability:** TSM's concentration of manufacturing in Taiwan is a significant geopolitical risk. Any conflict or disruption in the region could severely impact its operations.
3.  **A Shift in Chip Design Architecture:** A radical shift in chip design, such as the widespread adoption of a new, less capital-intensive manufacturing technology, could erode TSM's current advantages.

**KPIs to Monitor:**
*   **Market Share:** A decline in foundry market share would indicate increasing competition.
*   **Gross Margin:** A sustained decline in gross margin could signal a loss of pricing power.
*   **R&D Spending as a % of Revenue:** A decrease in R&D investment could impact future technological leadership.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** A significant reduction in capex could signal a less optimistic outlook on future demand.
*   **Customer Concentration:** An increase in reliance on a single customer would increase risk.
*   **Technology Node Leadership:** Any delay in the rollout of new process nodes would be a red flag.
*   **Geopolitical Developments:** Monitor any changes in the political climate that could affect TSM's operations.
*   **Competitor Progress:** Closely track the technological advancements of competitors like Samsung and Intel.

**Short Verdict Paragraph:**
TSM's moat is wide and durable, built on a foundation of deep customer relationships, high switching costs, and a significant cost advantage derived from its massive scale and industry-leading process technology. The company's relentless investment in R&D and capital expenditures creates a formidable barrier to entry, making it difficult for competitors to catch up. While geopolitical risks and the ever-present threat of technological disruption remain, TSM's current market position and execution capabilities suggest that its competitive advantages will persist for at least the next decade. A significant shift in technological leadership or a major geopolitical event would be the most likely catalysts for a change in the moat rating.
