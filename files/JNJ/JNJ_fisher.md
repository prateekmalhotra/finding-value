### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson's Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments are well-positioned for sustained growth. In Innovative Medicine, key products like DARZALEX (multiple myeloma), TREMFYA (psoriatic arthritis), and CARVYKTI (multiple myeloma) continue to see strong sales growth, with the company projecting at least $57 billion in revenue for the segment by 2025. The MedTech division is also expanding, particularly in high-growth areas like cardiovascular, through acquisitions such as Abiomed and Shockwave.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J maintains a strong commitment to R&D, investing $15.1 billion in 2023, which represents 17.8% of sales. The company's pipeline is a key focus, with numerous late-stage assets and plans to launch over 20 new therapies and 50 product expansions before 2030. Strategic acquisitions, such as the recent purchases of Shockwave Medical and Proteologix, are actively used to supplement the internal pipeline and enter new, high-growth technology areas. This dual approach of internal R&D and external M&A demonstrates a clear strategy for future growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000075/jnj-20240630.htm']

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J's R&D spending as a percentage of sales (17.8% in 2023) is substantial and has proven effective. The company's pipeline has delivered numerous blockbuster drugs, and it has a strong track record of securing regulatory approvals for new products and expanded indications for existing ones. Management highlights its R&D productivity, noting that a significant portion of its sales comes from recently launched products. The separation from the lower-margin Consumer Health business (Kenvue) has allowed for an even greater focus on high-innovation areas in medicine and medical technology.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's global scale and broad portfolio across Innovative Medicine and MedTech provide its sales force with significant leverage and access to healthcare systems worldwide. Sales have shown consistent growth, with a 7.4% increase in 2023 (excluding the COVID-19 vaccine). The company's ability to drive strong performance in key products, such as the 24% operational sales growth for DARZALEX in 2023, showcases the effectiveness of its commercial execution. The company also has a strong global presence, with 48.7% of its 2023 sales generated outside the United States.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson maintains strong profitability. For the fiscal year 2023, the company's gross profit margin was 69.1%, and its net earnings margin from continuing operations was 17.9%. In the second quarter of 2024, the gross margin was 69.4%. These margins are indicative of a company with strong pricing power and a favorable product mix, particularly after divesting the lower-margin consumer business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000075/jnj-20240630.htm']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving margins through a combination of shifting its portfolio toward higher-growth, higher-margin products and executing on cost efficiencies. The separation of Kenvue was a major strategic move to enhance the company's margin profile. Additionally, J&J is undertaking restructuring initiatives within its MedTech segment to optimize its cost structure and streamline operations. The company also actively manages its product portfolio, investing in new technologies and divesting non-strategic assets to improve profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000075/jnj-20240630.htm']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J's long-standing Credo emphasizes its responsibility to its employees. The company offers competitive benefits and invests in employee development and well-being programs. While the company's 2023 10-K notes that some employees are represented by unions, it states that it considers its employee relations to be good. There are no recent, widespread reports of major labor disputes or strikes that would suggest systemic issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Johnson & Johnson shows stability and a clear succession plan, with Joaquin Duato having taken over as CEO in January 2022 after a long tenure with the company. The executive committee is comprised of experienced leaders with deep industry knowledge. The company's proxy statement outlines a compensation program designed to align executive interests with long-term shareholder value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson operates with a decentralized management structure, which empowers leaders within its Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. The company's 10-K and investor presentations name numerous executives beyond the CEO and CFO who lead major divisions and functions, indicating a deep bench of talent. This structure allows for focused leadership within each segment while maintaining a cohesive corporate strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large accelerated filer, J&J is subject to rigorous accounting and internal control standards. The independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023. The company provides detailed segment reporting, offering transparency into the performance of its Innovative Medicine and MedTech businesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J's key competitive advantages are its scale, diversification, and robust supply chain and commercial infrastructure. In an industry defined by patent cycles, J&J's ability to manage a portfolio of products at different stages of their lifecycle provides a buffer against individual patent expirations. The company's regulatory expertise and long-standing relationships with healthcare providers are critical intangible assets that are difficult for smaller competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J's consistent and substantial investment in R&D, even during periods of market uncertainty, demonstrates a focus on long-term value creation. The company's strategic decision to separate the Consumer Health business, while complex and costly in the short term, was explicitly aimed at sharpening its focus on higher-growth, innovation-driven markets for the long run. Management's long-term financial targets and pipeline development goals further underscore this long-range perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J has a very strong financial position. As of June 30, 2024, the company had $24.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It generates significant cash flow from operations ($9.3 billion in the first six months of 2024) which is more than sufficient to fund R&D, capital expenditures, and dividends. The company has a history of share repurchase programs and has not recently relied on dilutive equity financing for its growth initiatives, including major acquisitions, which are typically funded with cash and debt.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000075/jnj-20240630.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor presentations, and SEC filings. During these communications, executives address both successes and challenges, such as the impact of patent expirations on key products like STELARA and ongoing litigation risks. While the company's legal discussions are necessarily guarded, management does provide updates on the status of major litigation and its financial provisions for these matters.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/JNJ/transcripts/2025/2/']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** This is the most challenging point for Johnson & Johnson. The company faces significant, high-profile litigation related to its talc-based baby powder, with allegations of asbestos contamination and links to cancer. It has also been involved in litigation concerning the opioid crisis and other product liability claims. While J&J maintains that its products are safe and has vigorously defended itself, the sheer volume and severity of the litigation, as well as the proposed multi-billion dollar settlements, raise significant questions and prevent an assessment of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040624000009/jnj-20231231.htm']

**Fisher Score: 14/15**

### Synthesis
Johnson & Johnson scores highly on nearly all of Fisher's points, reflecting its status as a well-managed, innovative, and financially robust healthcare leader. Its primary strengths lie in its commitment to R&D, a strong product pipeline, and a clear strategy for long-term growth in its focused Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. The company's financial discipline is evident in its strong margins, powerful cash flow, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. The single, but significant, blemish is the "unquestionable integrity" criterion, due to the ongoing and reputationally damaging talc and opioid litigation. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are a definitive and final resolution of the talc litigation, which could potentially flip the "No" on point 15 to a "Yes," and the successful integration and performance of its recent large acquisitions, particularly Shockwave Medical, which is crucial for validating its M&A-driven growth strategy in MedTech.
