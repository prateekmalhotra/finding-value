### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

This model, combined with a strong brand and effective marketing, has resulted in consistent growth. The company's digital sales infrastructure, which generates over 85% of U.S. sales, and its expanding loyalty program with 35.7 million members in 2024, are indicative of a highly effective and modern sales organization.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Domino's is focused on improving profit margins through several initiatives. These include procurement productivity in its supply chain, which led to a 1.1 percentage point decrease in food costs as a percentage of revenue in 2024. The company also benefits from its asset-light franchise model, which provides a consistent royalty stream with minimal capital investment. Furthermore, ongoing technological improvements and a focus on operational efficiency contribute to margin stability.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Domino's executive team, as detailed in its 2024 10-K, includes leaders with extensive experience in the QSR industry and within the company. The company's structure, with dedicated leadership for its U.S., international, and supply chain segments, demonstrates a depth of management.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Domino's "fortressing" strategy of increasing store density in existing markets is a key competitive advantage, as it improves delivery times and enhances carryout convenience. The company's vertically integrated supply chain ensures quality control and cost efficiencies, a significant advantage in the QSR industry. The company's early and aggressive adoption of technology for ordering and delivery has also been a major differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Domino's "Hungry for MORE" strategy, with its goal of 7% annual global sales growth through 2028, indicates a long-range outlook.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Domino's has a strong cash flow generation, with free cash flow surging 43.9% to $331.7 million in the first two quarters of 2025. The company has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, with $814.3 million remaining under its share repurchase authorization as of December 29, 2024. While the company has substantial debt, its strong cash flow and access to debt markets suggest it can fund its growth without significant equity dilution.

Synthesis:
Domino's Pizza, Inc. scores very highly on Fisher's 15-point checklist, with all 15 points receiving a "Yes." The company's strongest positives are its dominant position in a growing global market, its effective use of technology and a franchise model that fuels expansion and profitability. The "Hungry for MORE" strategy provides a clear roadmap for future growth. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its e-commerce platform redesign and its ability to continue to innovate on the menu to maintain consumer interest. Continued success in international markets will also be a key factor. There are currently no "No" answers to flip, but a significant downturn in same-store sales growth or a major disruption in its supply chain could warrant a re-evaluation of some points.

fisher score is 15 / 15
