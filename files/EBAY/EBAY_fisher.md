**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's core marketplace business operates in the massive global e-commerce market, which is projected to continue growing. The company is focusing on non-new, in-season products, collectibles, and refurbished items, creating a niche. However, the Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), a key metric, has been relatively stagnant, showing low single-digit growth, which casts doubt on the idea of a "sizable" increase in sales.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay is investing in technology, such as AI-powered tools like "Magical Listing" to improve the user experience. They are also focused on growing their advertising business and improving payment and shipping processes. These initiatives show a commitment to ongoing development.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's R&D spending is significant, but its effectiveness is debatable. While they are launching new features, the overall GMV and revenue growth remain sluggish compared to the size of their investment. The impact of R&D on the company's top-line growth is not as pronounced as it is for some of its faster-growing competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's "sales" are generated through its marketplace, so the effectiveness of its sales organization is tied to its ability to attract and retain buyers and sellers. While eBay has a massive user base, its active buyer number has been declining. This suggests that their marketing and user-acquisition efforts are not as effective as they could be, especially when compared to the growth of other e-commerce platforms.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay consistently maintains high gross profit margins, often in the 70-80% range. Its operating margins are also healthy, although they can be affected by investments and restructuring costs. These margins are generally strong compared to many other e-commerce companies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm](https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has been focused on cost discipline and operational efficiency. This includes optimizing marketing spend, controlling headcount, and streamlining workflows. The growth of higher-margin revenue streams, such as advertising, also contributes to margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no widespread reports of significant labor disputes or poor employee relations at eBay. The company frequently appears on "best places to work" lists. However, like many tech companies, it has undergone layoffs, which can impact morale.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at eBay has been relatively stable in recent years under CEO Jamie Iannone. There are no public signs of significant discord or turnover among the top ranks.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's leadership team includes experienced executives from various technology and e-commerce backgrounds. The company has a clear organizational structure with leaders for different regions and functions, suggesting a good depth of management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a long-standing public company, eBay has well-established accounting and financial reporting processes. Its SEC filings are detailed and audited by a major accounting firm. There are no indications of significant issues with its accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's key differentiator is its focus on non-new and unique items, which creates a treasure-hunt-like experience. This focus, along with its auction-style listings, sets it apart from competitors like Amazon. However, the rise of specialized online marketplaces for high-value collectibles is a threat.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary often emphasizes long-term, sustainable growth. They are making investments in technology and marketing that may not have an immediate payoff but are intended to strengthen the platform for the future. However, the company is also focused on near-term profitability and shareholder returns through buybacks.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay has a strong balance sheet with a healthy cash position and generates significant free cash flow. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks, which reduces the number of outstanding shares rather than diluting them. There is very low risk of equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's management team holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed financial reports. They are generally transparent about the challenges the company faces, such as slowing growth and competition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/EBAY/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/EBAY/transcripts/)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1065088/000106508825000037/ebay-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**Synthesis**

eBay scores well on many of Fisher's points related to financial strength, management quality, and profitability. The company has a solid balance sheet, high profit margins, and a stable and experienced leadership team. However, its biggest challenge is its lack of growth. The stagnant GMV and declining active buyer base are major concerns that cast a shadow over its long-term prospects. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are a sustained turnaround in GMV growth, a reversal of the decline in active buyers, or a significant competitive blow from a niche marketplace. To turn the "No" answers into "Yes," eBay would need to demonstrate that its R&D and sales efforts can translate into meaningful and sustainable top-line growth.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
