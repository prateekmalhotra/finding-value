Here is the Fisher analysis for Apple Inc.:

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's Services division continues to show strong growth, with a 13% increase in net sales for the nine months ended June 28, 2025, driven by advertising, the App Store, and cloud services. The company's large and loyal customer base provides a significant opportunity for further expansion of its high-margin services. While iPhone sales remain a significant portion of revenue, the growth in services and other product categories like Mac provide runways for future sales increases.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's research and development (R&D) expenses increased to $25.7 billion for the nine months ended June 28, 2025, up from $23.6 billion in the same period of the prior year, primarily due to increases in headcount-related expenses and infrastructure-related costs. This sustained high level of R&D spending indicates a strong commitment to developing new and improved products and services. The company also announced updates to all of its operating systems (iOS 26, macOS Tahoe 26, etc.) in the third quarter of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's R&D as a percentage of net sales was 8% for the nine months ended June 28, 2025. While this is a significant absolute investment, it is a relatively low percentage compared to many other technology companies. However, Apple's R&D is highly effective, as demonstrated by its consistent introduction of successful new products and features that drive significant revenue.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000073/aapl-20250628.htm (June 28, 2025)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of September 28, 2024, Apple's direct distribution channels, including its retail and online stores, accounted for 38% of total net sales, with the remaining 62% coming from indirect channels like third-party cellular network carriers and retailers. This multichannel approach, combined with a strong global brand, has created a highly effective and extensive sales organization. The company continues to invest in its retail presence and direct sales force to enhance customer experience and drive sales.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the nine months ended June 28, 2025, Apple's total gross margin percentage was 46.8%, up from 46.2% in the prior year period. The gross margin for services was particularly high at 75.5%. These margins are consistently high and demonstrate Apple's strong pricing power and cost management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019325000073/aapl-20250628.htm (June 28, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple is focused on improving its product and services mix, with services having a significantly higher gross margin percentage (75.5%) than products (36.9%) for the nine months ended June 28, 2025. Continued growth in the high-margin services business is a key driver of overall margin improvement. Additionally, the company is focused on cost savings in its product manufacturing.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of September 28, 2024, Apple had approximately 164,000 full-time equivalent employees. While there have been some reports of unionization efforts at certain retail locations, there is no evidence of widespread labor disputes that would materially impact the company's operations. Apple states its commitment to providing a safe, inclusive, and supportive work environment.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple has a stable and long-tenured executive team, with many key leaders having been with the company for over a decade. The company's 2025 Proxy Statement will provide further details on executive compensation and any related-party transactions, but there is no public information to suggest any significant issues with executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019324000123/aapl-20240928.htm (September 28, 2024)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's management team, as detailed on its website and in its proxy statements, shows a deep bench of experienced executives across all key functions and geographies. The company has a strong track record of promoting from within, indicating a focus on management development and succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. This indicates that the company maintains effective internal controls. Additionally, the detailed segment and product-level financial data provided in their SEC filings suggests robust cost analysis and accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019324000123/aapl-20240928.htm (September 28, 2024)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's key competitive advantage is its vertically integrated ecosystem of hardware, software, and services, which creates a strong "walled garden" effect and high switching costs for customers. The seamless integration between devices like the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, along with services like iCloud and the App Store, creates a user experience that is difficult for competitors to replicate. This ecosystem fosters strong brand loyalty and provides a significant long-term competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320193/000032019324000123/aapl-20240928.htm (September 28, 2024)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's consistent and significant investment in R&D, even during periods of slower sales growth, demonstrates a long-range outlook. The company's willingness to invest in new product categories and technologies that may take years to become profitable, such as the Apple Vision Pro, further supports this conclusion. R&D spending was $31.4 billion for the year ended September 28, 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 28, 2025, Apple had $36.3 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $96.7 billion in marketable securities. The company also has a strong history of share buybacks, having repurchased $69.3 billion of its common stock in the nine months ended June 28, 2025. Given its substantial cash reserves, strong cash flow generation, and access to debt markets, there is no foreseeable need for equity financing that would dilute shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple's management regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls and provides detailed financial data in its SEC filings. While the company is known for its secrecy regarding future products, management is generally forthcoming about business trends and challenges during its public communications. For example, in the Q1 2025 earnings call, management discussed the decrease in Greater China net sales and the factors contributing to it.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Apple is currently subject to a number of legal proceedings and government investigations, including an antitrust lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and investigations by the European Commission under the Digital Markets Act. These legal and regulatory challenges, while not definitive proof of a lack of integrity, raise questions and prevent a clear "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No

---
Synthesis: Apple demonstrates strength across the majority of Fisher's 15 points, particularly in its long-term growth potential in Services, commitment to R&D, strong financial position, and well-established sales organization. The primary area of concern is the increasing legal and regulatory scrutiny the company faces, which casts a shadow on its otherwise strong position. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the outcomes of the ongoing antitrust investigations and the success of new product launches in maintaining sales momentum. A resolution of the legal challenges in Apple's favor would likely flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes" and solidify its position as an outstanding long-term investment according to Fisher's criteria.

fisher score is 14 / 15
