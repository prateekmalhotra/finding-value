### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

---

#### **1. Catalyst Title: Membership Fee Increase**

*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Costco increased its annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada, effective September 1, 2024. The fee for Gold Star, Business, and Business affiliate memberships increased to $65 per year, and the Executive membership fee increased to $130.
*   **Mechanism:** A membership fee increase directly boosts high-margin revenue. Since membership fees are almost pure profit, this increase will flow directly to the bottom line, increasing net income and EPS, which should lead to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** The fee increase took effect on September 1, 2024, and its full impact will be realized over the following 12 months as memberships are renewed.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Assumes a 5% increase in membership fee revenue over the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Assumes an 8% increase in membership fee revenue over the next 12 months, in line with recent performance.
    *   **High Scenario:** Assumes a 10% increase in membership fee revenue over the next 12 months, driven by strong renewal rates and new member sign-ups.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). The market has likely priced in some of this increase, but the full impact on earnings will become clearer over the next few quarters.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The fee increase has already been implemented. The only uncertainty is the impact on renewal rates.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Maintaining high membership renewal rates despite the fee increase.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly membership fee revenue growth (reported in 10-Q filings).
    *   Membership renewal rates (reported in 10-Q filings).
    *   New member sign-up trends (discussed in earnings calls).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Higher than expected membership churn due to the price increase.
    *   Negative consumer reaction impacting brand perception.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor renewal rates in upcoming quarterly reports to assess the impact of the fee increase.

---

#### **2. Catalyst Title: Special Dividend**

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Costco has a history of returning cash to shareholders through special dividends, including a $15 per share special dividend in January 2024. Given the company's strong cash position and cash flow generation, another special dividend is possible.
*   **Mechanism:** A special dividend directly returns capital to shareholders, making the stock more attractive to income-oriented investors and signaling management's confidence in the company's financial health.
*   **Timing:** A special dividend could be announced at any time, but is most likely in late 2025 or early 2026, consistent with past trends.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** A special dividend of $10 per share.
    *   **Base Scenario:** A special dividend of $15 per share, in line with the most recent special dividend.
    *   **High Scenario:** A special dividend of $20 per share, driven by exceptionally strong cash flow.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (3-6%). The impact would be a one-time boost to the stock price around the announcement and payment dates.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The company has a history of special dividends, but there is no guarantee of another one in the near term.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a lack of other immediate capital allocation priorities (e.g., major acquisitions).
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet (reported in 10-Q filings).
    *   Free cash flow generation (calculated from cash flow statements).
    *   Management commentary on capital allocation (in earnings calls).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant economic downturn could lead the company to conserve cash.
    *   A large acquisition or other capital-intensive project could divert funds.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the company's cash balance and management commentary for any indications of a potential special dividend.

#### **3. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program**

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Costco has an active $4 billion share repurchase program authorized through January 2027. As of May 11, 2025, $2.242 billion remained available under the program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing. The company can repurchase shares at any time under the current authorization.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Repurchase of $1 billion in shares over the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Repurchase of $2 billion in shares over the next 12 months.
    *   **High Scenario:** Repurchase of the full remaining authorization of $2.242 billion over the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (1-3%). The impact is gradual and depends on the pace of repurchases.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The program is authorized and the company has a history of executing on its repurchase plans.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The stock price being at a level management deems attractive for repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly share repurchase activity (reported in 10-Q filings).
    *   Remaining authorization under the repurchase program.
    *   Management commentary on share repurchases (in earnings calls).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A sharp increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   A need to conserve cash for other purposes could slow down the pace of repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The share repurchase program provides ongoing support for the stock price.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Costco continues to expand its international footprint, with a focus on markets in Asia and Europe. New warehouse openings in these regions are a key driver of long-term growth.
*   **Mechanism:** International expansion provides access to new markets and sources of revenue growth. As these new markets mature, they are expected to contribute significantly to both sales and profits.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with a steady pace of new warehouse openings expected over the next several years.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 10-15 new international warehouses per year.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 15-20 new international warehouses per year.
    *   **High Scenario:** 20-25 new international warehouses per year.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20% over the long term). The impact will be gradual as new stores are opened and mature.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a proven track record of successful international expansion and has stated its intention to continue this strategy.

    *   Comparable sales growth in international segments.
    *   Management commentary on international expansion plans (in earnings calls).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Economic or political instability in key international markets.
    *   Execution challenges in new markets.
    *   Increased competition from local and international retailers.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. International expansion is a key long-term growth driver for the company.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

#### **1. Membership Fee Increase**

*   **Formula:** Change in Stock Price = (Increase in Membership Fee Revenue \* P/E Ratio) / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Increase in Membership Fee Revenue: $370 million (as estimated in the 10-K).
    *   P/E Ratio: 35x (approximate current P/E).
    *   Shares Outstanding: 444 million.
*   **Calculation:** ($370,000,000 \* 35) / 444,000,000 = **$29.17 per share increase**, or a **~3.3%** increase from a hypothetical current price of $880.

#### **2. Special Dividend**

*   **Formula:** Stock Price Impact = Dividend per Share
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Special Dividend per Share: $15 (in line with the last special dividend).
*   **Calculation:** A $15 special dividend would result in a direct cash return to shareholders of that amount, and the stock price would likely increase by a similar amount in the short term. This represents a **~1.7%** return on a hypothetical current price of $880.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for Costco is positive. The realization of the recent membership fee increase, the high probability of continued share repurchases, and the potential for a special dividend all provide a positive tailwind for the stock over the next 0-12 months. While there are risks, such as a potential for higher-than-expected membership churn, the overall outlook for the near term is favorable.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Global Recession:** A deep and prolonged global recession could significantly impact consumer spending, leading to lower sales and membership renewal rates, which would negate the positive impact of any catalysts.
2.  **Major Supply Chain Disruption:** A major disruption to global supply chains, whether due to geopolitical events, natural disasters, or other factors, could lead to product shortages and higher costs, which would negatively impact Costco's business.
3.  **Significant Data Breach:** A major cybersecurity incident that compromises the personal or financial data of millions of members could severely damage the company's reputation and lead to a loss of trust, resulting in a decline in membership and sales.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on this analysis, the outlook for Costco is positive, with several near-term and long-term catalysts that could drive the stock price higher. The most significant near-term catalyst is the full realization of the recent membership fee increase, which is expected to have a direct and positive impact on earnings. The primary indicator to monitor is the company's membership renewal rates, which will be a key gauge of the consumer response to the fee increase.
