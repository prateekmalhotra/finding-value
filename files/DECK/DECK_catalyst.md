### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Aggressive Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Deckers has a history of robust share buybacks. On May 21, 2025, the Board approved an additional authorization of $2,250,000 to repurchase shares of common stock, demonstrating a continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price, assuming the company's valuation multiple remains constant. This signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with the new authorization effective immediately.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Repurchase of $1 billion in shares over the next 12 months.

### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. HOKA Brand Growth Impact:**
*   **Assumptions:** Current DECK Enterprise Value (EV) of ~$30B. HOKA contributes ~45% of revenue. A 20% increase in HOKA revenue could add ~$446M in revenue. Assuming a 25% operating margin, this adds ~$111.5M in operating income. Applying a 20x multiple to this incremental operating income could add ~$2.23B to the EV, a ~7.4% increase.

**2. Share Repurchase Impact:**
*   **Assumptions:** Current market cap of ~$30B. Repurchase of $1.5B in shares reduces the share count by ~5%. This would increase EPS by a corresponding amount, potentially leading to a 5% increase in the stock price, all else being equal.

### **Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Deckers are predominantly positive. The aggressive share repurchase program provides a strong backstop for the stock, while the continued hyper-growth of the HOKA brand and the resilience of the UGG brand provide a powerful one-two punch for revenue and earnings growth. The combination of these factors suggests a positive stock performance in the 0–12 month timeframe.

### **Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A sudden and severe downturn in consumer discretionary spending:** This would impact both the HOKA and UGG brands, potentially leading to a sharp decline in revenue and earnings.
2.  **A significant fashion shift away from the "chunky sneaker" and "comfort" trends:** This would directly impact the core aesthetics of both HOKA and UGG.
3.  **Major supply chain disruptions or a significant increase in input costs:** This could impact margins and the ability to meet demand.

### **Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Deckers Outdoor Corporation presents a compelling investment case driven by the powerful combination of a large-scale share repurchase program and the exceptional growth of its HOKA brand. The continued resilience and profitability of the UGG brand provide a stable foundation for the company's growth initiatives. We recommend a "Buy" rating with an expected upside of 15-25% over the next 12-18 months. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly revenue growth of the HOKA brand.
