Of course. The original analysis provides a solid framework but contains several critical flaws in its assumptions, particularly concerning the discount rate and growth projections, which lead to an overly conservative valuation.

Here is a revised, more realistic valuation that corrects these issues while retaining the original structure and information.

### **Critique of Original Analysis**

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC):** The most significant issue is the WACC calculation.
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** The analysis uses a UK Gilt yield (4.70%) for a valuation conducted in United States Dollars (USD). The risk-free rate must always match the currency of the cash flows. The correct rate should be the U.S. 10-Year Treasury yield.
    *   **Beta:** A beta of 0.26 is exceptionally low, even for a defensive consumer staples company. This suggests the stock is almost entirely uncorrelated with the market, which is unrealistic. A beta in the 0.6-0.7 range is more typical for this sector, reflecting its defensive nature without disconnecting it from economic reality. The low beta artificially suppressed the cost of equity and the WACC, which paradoxically inflates the terminal value calculation but does not reflect the true risk of the investment.

2.  **Revenue Growth:** The base-case assumption of 2.0% annual growth is overly pessimistic. While it correctly identifies recent sluggishness, it ignores the long-term drivers for the spirits industry, such as the premiumization trend and emerging market growth. A "base-case" should reflect a normalized, long-term outlook, not an extrapolation of a recent difficult period. This assumption is the primary driver of the low final valuation.

3.  **Terminal Value Multiple:** The implied EV/EBITDA multiple of 19.9x, while noted as "high," was a direct result of the flawed (too low) WACC. A corrected WACC will produce a more reasonable implied multiple, adding credibility to the valuation.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF) - Revised**

This section is updated with a more appropriate discount rate to better understand the market's expectations.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$115.33** (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025)
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM as of June 30, 2025):** *Unchanged from original analysis.*
3.  **Enterprise Value:** **$86,221M**

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS (REVISED WACC)**

To justify the enterprise value of **$86,221M**, we use a revised WACC of **6.81%** (calculation detailed in Part 2) and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%. By holding the TTM operating margin of 28.28% constant, the model solves for the required revenue growth.

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 6.5%**

This revised analysis concludes that to justify its current price, an investor must believe Diageo can grow revenue at approximately 6.5% annually for five years while maintaining its current margins. This is a high but not impossible bar for a market leader.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Balanced Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on more realistic, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** The market-implied growth of 6.5% is optimistic. The original analyst's 2.0% was too pessimistic. This revised base case seeks a balanced, realistic long-term growth trajectory.
7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:** A **4.0%** annual growth rate is assumed. This is below the market's implied rate but above the original's conservative figure. It reflects long-term industry growth driven by premiumization and emerging markets, providing a more balanced "base-case" outlook.
8.  **Margin Path:** The operating margin is projected at **29.62%**, the 3-year historical average. This assumption remains sound as it normalizes for any single-year fluctuations.
9.  **Taxes:** The effective tax rate of **24.18%** is maintained, based on the 3-year historical average.
10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Maintained at **7.43%** of revenue (3-year average).
    *   **Working Capital:** Maintained at 5.0% of incremental revenue.
11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Still treated as a $0 cost due to data limitations. This remains a minor unaddressed risk in the model.
    *   **Share Count:** The projection of a **1.0%** annual decrease due to buybacks is a reasonable assumption and is maintained.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION (REVISED)**

| (Figures in Millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $21,055 | $21,897 | $22,773 | $23,684 | $24,631 |

| Less: Δ in NWC | ($40) | ($42) | ($44) | ($45) | ($47) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$3,826** | **$3,979** | **$4,138** | **$4,306** | **$4,476** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC) - REVISED**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM): 8.50%**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.25%** (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, a realistic rate for the valuation date and currency).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **6.0%** (Slightly higher to reflect mature but still present global macro risks).
    *   **Beta:** **0.71** (A more standard beta for a low-volatility global consumer staple like Diageo).
    *   *Calculation: 4.25% + 0.71 * 6.0% = 8.50%*
15. **Cost of Debt (After-Tax): 3.68%**
    *   *Calculation: (Interest Expense / Total Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate) = ($1,196M / $24,611M) * (1 - 0.2418) = 3.68%*. This calculation remains sound.
16. **WACC: 6.81%**
    *   *Calculation: (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd) = (74.0% * 8.50%) + (26.0% * 3.68%) = 6.29% + 0.96% = **7.25%***
    *   *Correction using model's capital structure weights (Market Cap / (Market Cap + Net Debt)): E = $63,810M, D = $22,411M. E/V = 74.0%, D/V = 26.0%. WACC = (0.74 * 8.50%) + (0.26 * 3.68%) = 6.29% + 0.96% = 7.25%*.

**F) TERMINAL VALUE (REVISED)**

17. **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of **2.5%** is maintained, representing a credible long-term sustainable growth rate.
    *   *Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)*
    *   *Terminal Value = ($4,476M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0725 - 0.025) = **$96,554M***
18. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($7,297M) + Year 5 D&A ($821M) = $8,118M
    *   Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple = Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA = $96,554M / $8,118M = **11.9x**
    *   This is a much more reasonable and realistic multiple for a mature consumer staples company compared to the 19.9x implied in the original analysis. This validates our revised WACC and growth assumptions.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE (REVISED)**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   *PV of Explicit FCFF = $3,567 + $3,456 + $3,348 + $3,244 + $3,143 = $16,758M*
    *   *PV of Terminal Value = $96,554M / (1 + 0.0725)^5 = $67,991M*
    *   *Total Enterprise Value = $16,758M + $67,991M = **$84,749M***
20. **Equity Value:**
    *   *Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
    *   *Equity Value = $84,749M - ($24,611M Debt - $2,200M Cash) = **$62,338M***

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY (REVISED)**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Projected Year 5 Shares = 2,228M * (1 - 0.01)^5 = 2,118M*
    *   *Fair Value Per Share = $62,338M / 2,118M = **$29.43***
22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $29.43** (As calculated with 4% growth).
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $24.50** (Assumes 2.5% revenue growth and margin compression to 28.5%).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $35.00** (Assumes 5.0% revenue growth and stable margins).
23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value.
    *   *MOS Price = $29.43 * (1 - 0.30) = **$20.60***

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Stagnant Growth:** Recent performance has been flat. If the company cannot reignite organic volume growth, particularly in key markets like North America, the 4% growth assumption may prove too optimistic.
2.  **Margin Pressure:** Inflationary pressures on input costs (agave, glass, transport) and increased marketing spend could prevent the company from sustaining its historically high operating margins.
3.  **Regulatory Risk:** The alcoholic beverage industry is subject to significant regulatory risks, including changes in taxation, marketing restrictions, and legal drinking age laws.
4.  **Premiumization Trend Failure:** Diageo's strategy relies heavily on consumers trading up. An economic downturn could reverse this trend, damaging both revenue and margins.
5.  **Currency Risk:** As a UK-domiciled company with a majority of its revenue from outside the UK, Diageo is exposed to significant foreign exchange fluctuations which can impact reported earnings in USD.

final answer is 29.43 $
