Company, Carriage Services, Inc. (CSV), date of analysis, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed, Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and a list of recent earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The death care industry is mature, with stable demand underpinned by long-term demographic trends like the aging of the U.S. population. Carriage Services' growth runway stems from consolidating this fragmented market via acquisitions and expanding its preneed (pre-planned) service backlog. As of December 31, 2024, the company had a substantial backlog of 102,799 preneed funeral contracts and 69,408 preneed cemetery contracts. Furthermore, a 2023 partnership with a national insurance provider is projected to drive 20% year-over-year growth in preneed funeral sales over the next five years, indicating a clear path to sizable sales increases.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While not a technology firm, management demonstrates a commitment to development through process innovation and strategic growth initiatives. The company is implementing “Trinity,” a digital transformation project to streamline processes and enhance customer service. It actively pursues growth through strategic mergers and acquisitions to expand its market reach. A key process development is the focus on preneed sales channels, highlighted by the aforementioned partnership with a national insurance provider to accelerate sales growth and market share.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carriage Services, like other companies in the funeral and cemetery industry, does not have a formal research and development (R&D) function, and its financial statements do not list any R&D expenditures. The company’s innovation is focused on service methods, sales processes, and acquisitions rather than technological or product R&D. Therefore, this criterion is not applicable to the company's business model.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a strong and improving sales function, particularly in its strategic focus on preneed sales. Preneed cemetery revenue grew to represent 69% of total cemetery revenue in 2024, up from 63% in 2023, driven by a 22.9% increase in the number of preneed interment rights sold. The new partnership with a national insurance provider, expected to double commission income and drive 20% annual growth in preneed funeral sales, is a testament to an effective, forward-looking sales strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carriage Services maintains substantial profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross profit of $143.4 million on revenues of $404.2 million, yielding a gross margin of approximately 35.5%. Its operating income was $81.8 million, for an operating margin of 20.2%. These margins are strong on an absolute basis and are competitive within the death care industry, indicating effective cost management and pricing power.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on enhancing profit margins through multiple initiatives. The company's "Relentless Improvement" strategy employs a "kaizen mindset" to boost operational efficiency and reduce costs. This was evidenced in 2024 by a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue. Concurrently, the company successfully implemented an "enhanced pricing strategy," which increased the average revenue per funeral contract during the same period.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company states in its 2024 10-K that none of its 2,420 employees are represented by unions and highlights its incentive programs designed to motivate its local Managing Partners. However, the filings do not provide quantitative metrics such as employee turnover, satisfaction scores, or safety records that would be required to independently verify "outstanding" personnel relations. Without such concrete evidence, a definitive positive conclusion cannot be reached.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent filings indicate significant instability rather than outstanding relations at the executive and board levels. In early 2024, the company's founder, Melvin Payne, ceased serving as Executive Chairman and transitioned to a consulting role. On June 6, 2024, the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer resigned, with a permanent successor not starting until January 2, 2025. This level of turnover in key leadership positions points to a period of transition and instability, not outstanding executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a named executive team beyond the CEO, and it successfully navigated a CFO transition by appointing an Interim Principal Financial Officer from within (the Chief Accounting Officer) before hiring a permanent replacement. Operationally, the company's decentralized model relies on local "Managing Partners" who have "extensive funeral and cemetery industry experience" and are responsible for day-to-day operations. This structure suggests significant operational depth in the field, mitigating key person risk at the corporate level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s accounting controls appear robust. In its Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2024, management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective. This assessment was supported by the company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, which issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal controls. There is no mention of any material weaknesses or financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the death care industry, reputation and local heritage are paramount competitive advantages. Carriage's strategy is to acquire and operate businesses with strong, established local brands, thereby preserving this key asset. A critical industry-specific moat is a large preneed contract backlog, which provides high-visibility future revenue. With a combined backlog of over 172,000 preneed contracts at year-end 2024, Carriage has a significant, locked-in customer base that provides a competitive advantage over firms that rely solely on at-need business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's stated strategy and incentive structures demonstrate a long-range profit outlook. The company is investing in long-term projects like its "Trinity" digital transformation and cemetery development, with capital expenditures for growth totaling $8.8 million in 2024. A key indicator is the "Good to Great" incentive program for field managers, which rewards performance based on a five-year compound annual growth rate, explicitly aligning employee compensation with long-term value creation rather than short-term results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial strategy does not rely on dilutive equity financing. Its primary sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations ($52.0 million in 2024) and its credit facility. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders, with a board-authorized share repurchase program that had $48.9 million available as of December 31, 2024. This demonstrates a clear preference for share buybacks over new issuances, protecting existing shareholders from dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public filings demonstrate a high degree of candor regarding both positive and negative developments. The 2024 10-K openly discusses a 4.9% decline in funeral contract volume and attributes it to specific market factors. Most notably, the company was transparent about its 2023-2024 review of strategic alternatives, its decision to remain independent, and the subsequent significant leadership transitions, including the founder stepping away from his executive role. Regular earnings calls provide a consistent forum for communication.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Based on available documents, there are no red flags indicating a lack of integrity. The company’s independent auditor provided an unqualified opinion on its financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. The Board of Directors approved amendments to the company's Code of Business Conduct and Ethics on October 30, 2024, suggesting attention to governance matters. The SEC filings do not mention any material legal proceedings, regulatory actions, or related-party transactions that would call management's integrity into question.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm) (Filed February 28, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Carriage Services scores well on Fisher's criteria related to its business model, financial management, and long-range outlook. Its strongest positives are a clear growth runway through acquisitions and preneed sales, worthwhile profit margins supported by active cost and pricing management, and a strong financial posture that avoids shareholder dilution. The primary negatives are concentrated in recent leadership instability, with significant turnover in the Chairman and CFO roles, and a lack of verifiable data to support "outstanding" employee relations. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are evidence of stability and cohesion within the new executive team, which would flip "Executive Relations" from No to Yes, and the successful execution of the preneed sales growth strategy, which would further solidify its market position. A "No" on Labor Relations could be flipped to "Yes" with the disclosure of quantitative data like employee retention or engagement metrics that benchmark favorably against peers.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
