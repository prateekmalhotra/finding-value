Company: The Kraft Heinz Company (KHC)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K (filed February 13, 2025), public market data.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The global packaged food market is projected to grow at a CAGR of approximately 4% to 6% over the next decade, providing a stable, albeit mature, backdrop for growth. Kraft Heinz is a major player, but its own Organic Net Sales decreased by 2.1% in fiscal 2024, driven by a 3.5% decline in volume/mix that was not fully offset by price increases. The company's strategy focuses on eight consumer-driven platforms, with "Taste Elevation" being the largest, accounting for 44% of 2024 net sales. While the overall market has a long runway, KHC's recent performance shows struggles in capturing this growth, with sales declining and reliance on pricing rather than volume.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's stated R&D objectives include "product innovations, renovations, and new technologies to meet changing consumer needs...and drive growth." The company spent approximately $150 million on R&D in 2024, a slight increase from $147 million in 2023. Strategic acquisitions like Germany-based Just Spices in 2022 indicate a willingness to buy into new growth areas. The 2024 10-K also describes a strategic reorganization of its international segment to "enable enhanced focus on the different strategies required for each of these regions as part of our long-term strategic plan," suggesting a commitment to future development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, Kraft Heinz's R&D expense was approximately $150 million on $25.85 billion in net sales, equating to just 0.58% of revenue. This level of spending is low for the industry; for comparison, competitors like General Mills and Mondelez historically spend around 1.5% and 0.9% of revenue on R&D, respectively. While KHC focuses on continuous optimization and brand renovation, the low absolute and relative R&D spend makes it difficult to classify their efforts as a key driver of growth or particularly effective relative to the company's large scale. The recent 2.1% decline in organic net sales further questions the effectiveness of current R&D in generating demand.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kraft Heinz has a massive distribution network, selling through its own sales organization as well as brokers and distributors to a wide range of channels including large-format retailers, e-commerce, and foodservice. However, the company has significant customer concentration, with its top five North American customers accounting for 46% of segment sales and Walmart alone representing 21% of consolidated net sales in 2024. This high concentration creates risk and reduces negotiating leverage. The 4.2% volume/mix decline in North America in 2024 suggests the sales organization is struggling to maintain shelf space and drive volume in its largest market.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal year 2024, Kraft Heinz reported a gross profit margin of 34.7% (calculated as $8.968B gross profit / $25.846B net sales). Its operating margin for the same period was 6.5% ($1.683B operating income / $25.846B net sales), though this was heavily impacted by $3.67 billion in goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses. Excluding these impairments, the adjusted operating margin would be significantly higher. The historical gross margin is strong for the food industry, demonstrating the value of its brands.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement through several levers. The company has implemented pricing actions to mitigate inflation, which contributed 1.4 percentage points to net sales in 2024. KHC is also focused on "efficiency initiatives," noting in its 2024 10-K that lower procurement and logistics costs, along with pricing, favorably impacted operating income. The company has also engaged in ongoing restructuring programs to streamline its organization. These actions demonstrate a clear and ongoing effort to protect and enhance profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kraft Heinz employed approximately 36,000 people globally as of December 28, 2024. The company's 2024 10-K states its November 2024 global engagement survey showed an "all-time high for employee engagement" and achieved a top-quartile ranking on its Inclusion Index. The company also reports its Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), a key safety metric, improved to 0.39 in 2024 from 0.53 in 2023, indicating a focus on employee safety. These self-reported metrics point toward positive and improving personnel relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant leadership changes recently. Carlos Abrams-Rivera was appointed CEO in December 2023, and several other executive roles, including President of North America and Global Chief Growth Officer, were also filled in late 2023. Additionally, a new Global General Counsel was appointed in November 2024. While this new team may bring fresh perspectives, such a high degree of recent turnover at the highest levels does not align with Fisher's preference for stable, long-tenured executive teams with a proven long-term track record together.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K details the business experience of nine executive officers, including the CEO, CFO, and leaders for key functions like Procurement, Supply Chain, and People, as well as the head of the large North America segment. Many of these executives have extensive experience at other major consumer packaged goods companies like Campbell Soup Company, Mars, and Anheuser-Busch InBev. This roster demonstrates a bench of experienced professionals in key operational and strategic roles beyond the CEO.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 28, 2024. The auditor's report states that the company "maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024." There were no material weaknesses identified, indicating that the company's accounting and control systems are sound from a regulatory and reporting standpoint.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the consumer packaged foods industry, brand equity and distribution scale are paramount competitive advantages. Kraft Heinz possesses a portfolio of iconic brands, including *Kraft*, *Oscar Mayer*, and *Heinz*, which are material to its business and among its most valuable assets. This brand power, combined with its vast global distribution network and deep relationships with the world's largest retailers, provides a significant barrier to entry. The fact that its largest customer, Walmart, accounts for 21% of sales demonstrates the depth of its integration into the global food supply chain.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in the 2024 10-K points to a long-range view. The company is making investments in technology and go-to-market strategies, which increased SG&A in the short term. Furthermore, the reorganization of its International segment into three distinct operating segments is explicitly part of a "long-term strategic plan" to enhance focus on different regional strategies. These actions, which involve upfront costs and organizational complexity, suggest a willingness to prioritize long-term positioning over maximizing immediate-term profits.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generated $4.2 billion in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2024. Rather than issuing shares, management is actively returning capital to shareholders. The Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion share repurchase program running through December 2026, and the company bought back nearly $1 billion in stock in 2024. With strong operating cash flow and a commitment to share buybacks, the risk of dilutive equity financing appears very low.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K provides extensive, candid disclosure regarding its challenges. It openly discusses the $3.67 billion in impairment losses, detailing which specific reporting units and brands were impaired and why, including a list of brands considered at heightened risk for future impairments. The document also frankly addresses negative volume/mix trends, the impact of price elasticity, and increased manufacturing costs. This level of transparent detail on significant business challenges demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2023, the company paid cash associated with the settlement of a consolidated securities class action lawsuit related to historical accounting and internal control issues. Furthermore, the 2024 10-K discloses that the IRS has proposed adjustments for the 2018 and 2019 tax years related to transfer pricing that could result in over $400 million in additional taxes and $170 million in penalties, which the company is contesting. While the company has a new executive team as of late 2023, these recent and ongoing issues from the recent past prevent a clean assessment of unquestionable integrity at this time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1637459/000163745925000011/khc-20241228.htm (February 13, 2025)]

---
Synthesis:
The analysis of Kraft Heinz reveals a mature company with significant, deeply entrenched assets but facing clear growth challenges. Its strongest positives are rooted in its scale and financial discipline: iconic brands, strong profit margins, excellent cost controls, and robust cash flow that supports shareholder returns without risk of dilution. Management is also candid about its challenges and appears to be making long-term strategic adjustments. The primary negatives stem from a lack of growth, questionable R&D effectiveness, high customer concentration, and recent executive turnover. Lingering issues from past accounting and tax disputes also tarnish its record on integrity. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables: the effectiveness of the new executive team's strategy and the performance of its innovation pipeline. Evidence that would flip a "No" to a "Yes" would include sustained organic volume growth (flipping #1 and #4), a significant increase in R&D spending as a percentage of sales with successful product launches (flipping #3), and a clean resolution of its IRS dispute (aiding #15).
