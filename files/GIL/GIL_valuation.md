Of course. Below is a detailed critique and revised valuation of Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL).

The original valuation was well-structured and followed a sound methodology. However, several assumptions could be refined to better reflect a realistic, forward-looking base case. The primary issues identified were:

1.  **Inconsistent Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** The ERP used in the Reverse DCF (4.0%) was different from the one used in the Analyst's Valuation (5.0%). Consistency is crucial for a valid comparison.
2.  **Potentially Conservative Growth & Margin Assumptions:** While prudence is important, the 3.5% revenue growth and flat 17.5% margin might understate Gildan's potential as a low-cost market leader capable of taking share and executing on efficiency initiatives.
3.  **Terminal Value Justification:** While the Gordon Growth method and its cross-check were logical, the terminal value is the most sensitive part of a DCF. Using an Exit Multiple as the primary method, based on industry and historical norms, can provide a more market-grounded valuation, with the implied growth rate serving as the cross-check.

The following analysis corrects these issues and refines the assumptions to create a more robust valuation.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deconstructs the market's current valuation to determine the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $55.70 (Markets Insider, August 22, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM):** The trailing twelve months (TTM) financials are constructed using the most recent annual (20-F, FY2024) and interim (6-K for Q2 2025) filings. (Data unchanged from original analysis).

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,275 |
| **Operating Income (EBIT)** | **$585** |
| Cash & Equivalents | $450 |
| Total Debt | $1,250 |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 149.06 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current market price of $55.70, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used to solve for the key unknown assumptions.

*   **WACC Calculation (Corrected for Consistency):**
    *   Cost of Equity: 10.11% (using 4.26% 10-Yr Treasury, 1.17 Beta, **5.0% ERP**). *Correction: Using a consistent 5.0% ERP.*
    *   Cost of Debt: 3.32% (after-tax).
    *   WACC: **9.22%**
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

Holding the TTM EBIT margin of **17.9%** constant, the model solves for the required revenue growth rate.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
To justify the $55.70 share price with a more realistic discount rate, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 8.2%**, with operating margins remaining stable at the current strong level of 17.9%. This implies a strong belief in sustained, high-profitability growth, well above historical norms and management guidance.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on refined, realistic assumptions grounded in company strategy, historical performance, and industry dynamics.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** The market's implied 8.2% growth is highly optimistic. The original analyst's 3.5% growth was prudent but perhaps too conservative. This revised base-case reflects a middle ground: Gildan leverages its low-cost manufacturing advantage to achieve steady market share gains in a mature industry.
7.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** A **4.0% CAGR for the next five years.** This is above long-term GDP growth, reflecting Gildan's ability to capture share and benefit from modest price increases, but remains well below the market's optimistic expectations.
8.  **Operating Margin:** The original assumption of 17.5% is a safe floor. However, given ongoing efficiency initiatives ("Gildan Sustainable Growth" plan), it's realistic to model a modest margin improvement. I will model margins expanding from **17.6% in Year 1 to 18.0% by Year 5**.
9.  **Taxes:** The 3-year average effective tax rate of **21.0%** remains a sound and stable assumption.
10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeling capex at **5.0% of revenue** is consistent with management's guidance for reinvestment in efficiency and capacity. This assumption is unchanged.
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeling the change in non-cash working capital as **5.0% of incremental revenue** remains a good proxy for historical needs. This assumption is unchanged.
11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) is treated as a non-cash charge added back and then a real cash expense by subtracting it from FCFF. Projecting it at **0.8% of revenue** is reasonable.
    *   Gildan's commitment to share repurchases is a core part of its capital allocation strategy. A projected net annual reduction in shares outstanding of **2.0%** remains a key, realistic assumption.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,406 | $3,542 | $3,684 | $3,831 | $3,985 |
| EBIT Margin | 17.6% | 17.7% | 17.8% | 17.9% | 18.0% |
| EBIT | $599 | $627 | $656 | $686 | $717 |
| NOPAT | $474 | $495 | $518 | $542 | $567 |
| Add: D&A (4.5% of Rev) | $153 | $159 | $166 | $172 | $179 |
| Less: SBC (0.8% of Rev)| ($27) | ($28) | ($29) | ($31) | ($32) |
| Less: Capex (5.0% of Rev)| ($170) | ($177) | ($184) | ($192) | ($199) |
| Less: Change in WC | ($7) | ($7) | ($7) | ($7) | ($8) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)**| **$423** | **$442** | **$464** | **$484** | **$507** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. Using a consistent, standard premium for the U.S. market.
    *   **Beta (Î²):** 1.17. Unchanged.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.17 * 5.0% = 10.11%**
15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-tax Cost of Debt: ~4.2%.
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 4.2% * (1 - 21.0%) = **3.32%**
16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (Market Cap): $8.31 Billion
    *   Market Value of Debt: $1.25 Billion
    *   **WACC = (87% * 10.11%) + (13% * 3.32%) = 9.22%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Exit Multiple Method:** Instead of relying on a perpetual growth rate, we will use an EV/EBITDA multiple, which is common for valuing mature industrial companies. A **9.0x EV/EBITDA multiple** is appropriate, reflecting the company's stability, strong cash flow generation, and is in line with its historical trading range and that of its peers.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $717M + $179M = $896M.
    *   **Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $896M * 9.0 = $8,064 Million**
18. **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   The terminal value of $8,064M implies a perpetual growth rate (g).
    *   `g = (WACC * TV - Final Year FCFF) / (TV + Final Year FCFF)`
    *   `Implied g = (9.22% * $8,064 - $507) / ($8,064 + $507) = 2.8%`
    *   An implied growth rate of 2.8% is a very reasonable long-term assumption, sitting between long-term inflation and nominal GDP growth. This confirms the 9.0x multiple is not overly aggressive.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $1,885 Million
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $5,176 Million (`$8,064 / (1.0922)^5`)
    *   **Enterprise Value = $1,885 + $5,176 = $7,061 Million**
20. **Equity Value:**
    *   `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash`
    *   Equity Value = $7,061M - $1,250M + $450M = **$6,261 Million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Shares in Year 5 (after 2.0% annual buyback): `149.06 * (1 - 0.02)^5` = 134.9 Million Shares
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $6,261 Million / 134.9 Million = $46.41 per share**
22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $46.41.** Assumes 4.0% revenue growth and margins expanding to 18.0%.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$36.** Assumes 2.0% revenue growth and margin compression to 16.5% due to a recessionary environment.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$57.** Assumes 5.5% revenue growth and margins reaching 18.5% from successful new product introductions and cost savings.
23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $46.41 * (1 - 0.30) = $32.49**

**Risk Notes** (Unchanged from original analysis)

1.  **Input Cost Volatility:** Gildan's profitability is sensitive to fluctuations in cotton and other raw material prices.
2.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** As a provider of basic apparel, Gildan is exposed to downturns in consumer spending during economic recessions.
3.  **Competition and Pricing Power:** The apparel industry is highly competitive. Failure to maintain its low-cost advantage or brand positioning could erode margins.
4.  **Supply Chain & Geopolitical Risks:** A significant portion of manufacturing is in Central America and the Caribbean, exposing the company to regional instability.
5.  **Fashion & Trend Risk:** While focused on basics, shifts in consumer preferences towards different materials or styles could impact demand for core products.
