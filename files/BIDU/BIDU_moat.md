### **Aggregation**

**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(4 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 3.37

**Final Weighted Score:** 67.4 / 100

### **Mapping**

A weighted score of 67.4 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range, which maps to a moat rating of 3.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is approximately 8-12 years. This is based on Baidu's strong brand recognition, its dominant position in the Chinese search market, and its significant investments in AI and other future technologies. However, the rapidly evolving nature of the tech industry and the intense competition in the Chinese market could erode this moat over the long term.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Intensifying Competition:** Increased competition from other Chinese tech giants in the areas of AI, cloud computing, and autonomous driving could erode Baidu's market share and profitability.
2.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** A more stringent regulatory environment in China could limit Baidu's ability to innovate and expand its business.
3.  **Technological Disruption:** The emergence of new technologies could disrupt the search market and render Baidu's current advantages obsolete.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Baidu Core's online marketing revenue growth:** A sustained decline could indicate a weakening of Baidu's core business.
*   **Baidu Core's non-online marketing revenue growth:** Strong growth in this area would indicate that Baidu's diversification efforts are succeeding.
*   **R&D as a percentage of revenue:** A significant decrease in this metric could signal a reduction in Baidu's commitment to innovation.
*   **Monthly Active Users (MAUs) of the Baidu App:** A decline in MAUs could indicate that Baidu is losing its grip on the mobile search market.
*   **Apollo Go's ride-hailing orders:** This metric will be a key indicator of the success of Baidu's autonomous driving business.
*   **AI Cloud revenue growth:** Strong growth in this area is crucial for Baidu's long-term success.
*   **Operating margin:** A declining operating margin could indicate that Baidu is facing increased competition or rising costs.
*   **Net income attributable to Baidu:** This is the ultimate measure of Baidu's profitability.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Baidu possesses a moderate moat, primarily derived from its strong brand, dominant market position in China, and its early and substantial investments in AI. The company's network effects and data advantage in its core search business create a solid foundation, while its growing AI cloud and autonomous driving businesses offer potential for future growth. However, the company faces significant challenges, including intense competition, a rapidly changing regulatory environment, and the high costs associated with its AI initiatives. A sustained decline in its core online marketing revenue or a failure to successfully monetize its AI investments could lead to a downgrade in its moat rating.

moat rating is 3 / 5
