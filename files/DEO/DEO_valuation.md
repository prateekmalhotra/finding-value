---

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Rationale:** With no explicit guidance, a conservative growth rate is appropriate. The recent 1.7% is a starting point. Given Diageo's brand strength and global footprint, a rate slightly above inflation is plausible. The 3-year historical CAGR (FY22-25) is approximately -0.44% (($20,245/$20,516)^(1/3)-1), reflecting recent volatility. I will assume a conservative **2.5% annual growth**, reflecting long-term inflation and modest volume/price increases.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Rationale:** The TTM operating margin is 28.28% ($5,726 / $20,245). The 3-year average is ~29.6%. Management's cost-saving program should support margins. I will assume the **operating margin remains stable at the current 28.3%**, with cost savings offsetting inflationary pressures.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Rationale:** The effective tax rate for the TTM period was 28.24%. The average over the last three years has been approximately 24.2%. The most recent figure is likely impacted by one-off charges mentioned in press releases. I will use the 3-year average for normalization. **Tax Rate Assumption: 24%**.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex was 8.0% of revenue ($1,612 / $20,245). The 3-year average is ~7.2%. I will assume Capex reverts to the mean at **7.5% of revenue**.
    *   **Working Capital:** The TTM change was -$77M. I will model working capital as **2.0% of incremental revenue**, a common assumption for stable consumer goods companies.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** Assumed at a constant **0.5% of revenue**.
    *   **Share Count:** The latest diluted weighted-average shares of **2,228 million** will be used for the final per-share calculation.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Unlevered Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $20,751 | $21,270 | $21,802 | $22,347 | $22,905 |
| EBIT (28.3% Margin) | $5,870 | $6,018 | $6,168 | $6,322 | $6,480 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 0.76) | $4,461 | $4,574 | $4,688 | $4,805 | $4,925 |
| (+) D&A | $688 | $702 | $717 | $732 | $748 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $104 | $106 | $109 | $112 | $115 |
| (-) Capex (7.5% of Rev) | $1,556 | $1,595 | $1,635 | $1,676 | $1,718 |
| (-) Chg. in WC | $10 | $10 | $11 | $11 | $11 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$3,479** | **$3,565** | **$3,650** | **$3,738** | **$3,829** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.30%** (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**. This is a standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta:** **0.75**. (Source: Assumed). This reflects Diageo's position as a stable, low-volatility consumer defensive company whose business cycles are less pronounced than the broader market.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 0.75 * 5.0% = 8.05%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** Interest Expense / Total Debt
    *   **Calculation:** $1,196M / $24,611M = **4.86%** (Pre-tax)
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.86% * (1 - 0.24) = 3.69%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   **Market Cap (E):** $127.35B (based on a recent approximate share price of $115 and 1,107M ADRs outstanding, equivalent to the 2,228M ordinary shares at a 4:1 ratio, adjusted for price)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $24.61B (using book value as a proxy)
    *   **Total Capital (E+D):** $151.96B
    *   **WACC = ($127.35B / $151.96B) * 8.05% + ($24.61B / $151.96B) * 3.69% = 6.74% + 0.60% = 7.34%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This is a reasonable long-term growth assumption, in line with long-run inflation expectations and sustainable growth for a mature company.
    *   **Calculation:** Terminal Value = $3,829 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.0734 - 0.025) = $3,925 / 0.0484 = **$81,089 million**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **EBITDA Year 5:** EBIT ($6,480M) + D&A ($748M) = $7,228M
    *   A historical median EV/EBITDA multiple for large-cap beverage companies is in the 12x-15x range. A conservative **12.0x** multiple is appropriate.
    *   **Terminal Value (Multiple):** $7,228M * 12.0 = **$86,736 million**
    *   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative (lower) terminal value, which will be used for the base case.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: ($3,479/1.0734¹) + ($3,565/1.0734²) + ($3,650/1.0734³) + ($3,738/1.0734⁴) + ($3,829/1.0734⁵) = $3,241 + $3,078 + $2,945 + $2,817 + $2,683 = **$14,764 million**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $81,089 / (1.0734)⁵ = **$56,801 million**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $14,764 + $56,801 = $71,565 million**

*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   **Net Debt:** Total Debt ($24,611M) - Cash ($2,200M) = **$22,411 million**
    *   **Equity Value = $71,565M - $22,411M = $49,154 million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value / Diluted Weighted-Average Shares
    *   **Calculation:** $49,154 million / 2,228 million shares = **$22.06 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $22.06**. Based on the assumptions outlined above.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$17**. Assumes 1.0% revenue growth, margin compression to 27.0%, and a higher WACC of 8.0%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$28**. Assumes 3.5% revenue growth, slight margin expansion to 29.0% from cost savings, and a lower WACC of 7.0%.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value provides a margin of safety.
    *   **MOS Price = $22.06 * (1 - 0.30) = $15.44**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Consumer Spending Downturn:** Diageo's premium portfolio is susceptible to shifts in discretionary spending, particularly in key markets like North America and Europe.
2.  **Regulatory and Tax Risk:** The beverage alcohol industry is subject to significant regulatory oversight and excise taxes globally, which can change unfavorably.
3.  **Execution Risk on "Accelerate" Program:** The valuation incorporates stability supported by cost savings. Failure to realize the targeted ~$625M in savings could pressure margins.
4.  **Foreign Exchange Fluctuation:** As a UK-based company reporting in USD for this analysis, significant swings in the GBP/USD exchange rate can impact reported results.
5.  **Input Cost Inflation:** Volatility in the costs of agave, grain, glass, and energy can impact gross margins if not fully offset by pricing actions.

final answer is 22.06 $
