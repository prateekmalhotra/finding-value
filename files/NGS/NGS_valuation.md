### **C) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Y1: 12.5%, then declining to 3% | Year 1 growth is based on the midpoint of 2025 Adjusted EBITDA guidance. Growth then declines to a sustainable rate. |
| **Operating Margin** | 22.2% | Based on TTM operating margin, assuming stable profitability. (Calculated from TTM financials) |
| **Tax Rate** | 23.3% | Based on the effective tax rate for the quarter ended March 31, 2025. (Q1 2025 10-Q) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | Y1: 64.8%, then 50% | Year 1 based on midpoint of management's 2025 capex guidance. Years 2-5 are based on TTM average, reflecting continued growth investment. |
| **Change in WC as % of Revenue Change** | 13.0% | Based on the TTM average. (Calculated from TTM financials) |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 1.18% | Based on the TTM average. (Calculated from TTM financials) |
| **Diluted Shares** | 12.611 million | Latest reported diluted weighted-average shares. (Q1 2025 10-Q) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 (2025) | Year 2 (2026) | Year 3 (2027) | Year 4 (2028) | Year 5 (2029) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | **$181.4** | **$199.5** | **$214.5** | **$225.2** | **$231.9** |
| EBIT (22.2%) | $40.3 | $44.3 | $47.6 | $50.0 | $51.5 |
| EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) | $30.9 | $34.0 | $36.5 | $38.3 | $39.5 |
| \+ D&A | $36.4 | $40.0 | $43.0 | $45.1 | $46.5 |
| \- SBC | $2.1 | $2.4 | $2.5 | $2.7 | $2.7 |
| \- Capex | $117.5 | $99.8 | $107.2 | $112.6 | $116.0 |
| \- Change in WC | $2.6 | $2.4 | $2.0 | $1.4 | $0.9 |
| **FCFF** | **($54.9)** | **($30.6)** | **($32.2)** | **($33.3)** | **($33.6)** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | **12.89%** | |
| - Risk-Free Rate | 4.287% | 10-Year US Treasury Yield (August 20, 2025). |
| - Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium. |
| - Beta | 1.72 | Reflects higher-than-market volatility of the oil and gas services industry. |
| **Cost of Debt** | **5.55%** | After-tax rate based on TTM interest expense and total debt. (Calculated) |
| **WACC** | **10.34%** | Weighted average based on market cap of $316.6M and debt of $168.0M. |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g) = 2.5% (long-run inflation expectation)
    *   Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Value = (-$33.6M \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1034 - 0.025) = **-$441.5 million**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $51.5M + $46.5M = $98.0M
    *   Exit Multiple = 7.71x (Current EV/EBITDA multiple)
    *   Terminal Value = $98.0M \* 7.71 = **$755.6 million**

Due to the significant discrepancy and the negative terminal value from the Gordon Growth method (caused by negative FCFF), the **Exit Multiple method will be used**. The negative FCFF is driven by high capital expenditures for growth, making the exit multiple a more appropriate measure for a company in a high-investment phase.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Calculation | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit Period FCFF | Sum of discounted FCFFs | ($108.9) |
| PV of Terminal Value | $755.6M / (1 + 0.1034)^5 | $462.1 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **PV of FCFFs + PV of TV** | **$353.2** |
| \- Total Debt | | ($168.0) |
| \+ Cash & Equivalents | | $2.1 |
| **Equity Value** | **Enterprise Value - Net Debt** | **$187.3** |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

| Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Key Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **$14.85** | As outlined above. |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$10.50** | Lower revenue growth (8% declining to 2%), margin compression to 20%, lower exit multiple (6.5x). |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$20.00** | Higher revenue growth (15% declining to 4%), margin expansion to 24%, higher exit multiple (8.5x). |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$10.40** | 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value. |

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Commodity Price Volatility:** The company's performance is highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices, which are cyclical and can impact customer capital expenditures.
2.  **Customer Concentration:** A significant portion of revenue is derived from a small number of customers, making the company vulnerable to changes in their business plans.
3.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation is dependent on the company's ability to successfully execute its growth strategy and achieve projected returns on its significant capital investments.
4.  **Interest Rate Risk:** The company's debt is subject to variable interest rates, which could increase interest expense and reduce profitability.
5.  **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in environmental regulations could increase compliance costs or affect demand for natural gas compression services.

final answer is 14.85 $
