### **3) Guidance Extracts**

*   **Revenue:** "We expect sales for the full year of 2024 to be down around 6% compared to 2023..." (POOL 10-Q, July 30, 2024, p. 15)
*   **Gross Margin:** "...we project gross margin for the full year of 2024 to be in line with our long-term outlook of approximately 30.0%." (POOL 10-Q, July 30, 2024, p. 15)

*   **Capital Expenditures:** "...we project capital expenditures for 2024 will be approximately 1.0% to 1.5% of net sales." (POOL 10-Q, July 30, 2024, p. 24)

### **4) Forecast & Assumptions**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Year 1 growth is set to -6.0% per management guidance. For years 2-5, a growth rate of 3.0% is assumed, reflecting a return to modest growth in line with industry trends and historical performance. (POOL 10-Q, July 30, 2024)
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT):** The operating margin is held stable at 12.0% for the forecast period, consistent with management's explicit guidance. (POOL 10-Q, July 30, 2024)
*   **Tax Rate:** A rate of 25.0% is used, based on management's guidance for the annual effective tax rate, excluding discrete items. (POOL 10-Q, July 30, 2024)
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Capex is modeled at 1.25% of revenue, the midpoint of management's guidance. (POOL 10-Q, July 30, 2024)
*   **Working Capital:** Change in Working Capital is modeled at 5.0% of the change in revenue, based on historical patterns for a distribution business.
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** SBC is projected at 0.4% of revenue, consistent with the TTM average.

### **5) Free Cash Flow Build**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers. The formula is:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,196 | $5,352 | $5,513 | $5,678 | $5,848 |
| EBIT (12.0% Margin) | $624 | $642 | $662 | $681 | $702 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-T)) | $468 | $482 | $496 | $511 | $526 |
| D&A | $41 | $42 | $43 | $44 | $46 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($21) | ($21) | ($22) | ($23) | ($23) |
| Capex | ($65) | ($67) | ($69) | ($71) | ($73) |
| Change in WC | $17 | ($8) | ($8) | ($8) | ($9) |
| **FCFF** | **$439** | **$428** | **$440** | **$453** | **$468** |

### **6) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.14 (3-Year Beta from GuruFocus). This beta reflects the stock's moderate cyclicality tied to discretionary consumer spending on pool construction and renovation.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 1.14 * 5.0% = 9.99%*
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Average Debt = $53M / $1,117M = 4.74%.
    *   *After-tax Cost of Debt = 4.74% * (1 - 25.0%) = 3.56%*
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Cap (approx.): $12.1B
    *   Total Debt: $1.1B
    *   *WACC = (12.1 / 13.2) * 9.99% + (1.1 / 13.2) * 3.56% = 9.15% + 0.30% = 9.45%*

### **7) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate (g) of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   *Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($468 * 1.025) / (9.45% - 2.5%) = $6,903M*
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $702M + $46M = $748M.
    *   A 10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple of 15.0x is a reasonable assumption for a stable industry leader.
    *   *Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $748M * 15.0 = $11,220M*
*   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value, which will be used for the base-case valuation.

### **8) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| (USD Millions) | **Value** |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Year 1-5 FCFF | $1,634 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $4,409 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$6,043** |
| Less: Total Debt | ($1,117) |
| Add: Cash & Equivalents | $97 |
| **Equity Value** | **$5,023** |

### **9) Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $5,023M / 38.4M = $130.81*
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $130.81**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $95.00** (Assumes -8% revenue decline in Year 1 followed by 1% growth, and 100bps margin compression to 11.0%).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $175.00** (Assumes -4% revenue decline in Year 1 followed by 5% growth, and 50bps margin expansion to 12.5%).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value is applied for a margin of safety.
    *   *MOS Price = $130.81 * (1 - 0.30) = $91.57*

### **10) Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Economic Sensitivity:** A slowdown in consumer discretionary spending could further depress demand for new pool construction and high-end remodeling, impacting revenue and margins. 2) **Weather Patterns:** Unfavorable weather conditions can shorten the pool season, reducing demand for maintenance products. 3) **Competitive Pressure:** Competition from mass merchants and online retailers could pressure gross margins over the long term. 4) **Input Cost Inflation:** Significant inflation in raw materials for chemicals and equipment could impact profitability if not fully passed through to customers.

final answer is 130.81 $
