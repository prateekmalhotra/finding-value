**6) Timeline / Gantt (concise)**

*   **Q3 2025:** Update on synergy realization, progress on asset sales.
*   **Q4 2025:** Further updates on synergies and asset sales, potential announcement of new CEO.
*   **Q1 2026:** New CEO in place, continued focus on integration and debt reduction.
*   **Q2 2026:** Continued progress on debt reduction, potential for new strategic initiatives from the new CEO.

**7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

*   **Synergy Realization:** If the company achieves the high end of synergy estimates ($150 million), this could add approximately $1.50 to EPS. At a 15x P/E multiple, this would translate to a $22.50 increase in the stock price.
*   **Debt Reduction:** If the company can reduce its debt by $500 million, this would save approximately $30 million in annual interest expense. This would add roughly $0.30 to EPS, which at a 15x P/E multiple, would add $4.50 to the stock price.

**8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for FUN are a mixed bag. The successful integration with Cedar Fair and the potential for significant synergies is a major positive. However, the recent earnings miss and the CEO succession create a degree of uncertainty. The market signal is currently neutral to slightly negative, but a positive announcement on any of the key catalysts could quickly change the sentiment.

**10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failed Integration:** A failure to successfully integrate the Cedar Fair and Six Flags businesses could lead to operational disruptions, cost overruns, and a failure to realize synergies.
2.  **Economic Downturn:** A significant economic recession would likely lead to a sharp decline in attendance and in-park spending, making it difficult for the company to achieve its financial goals.
3.  **Botched CEO Succession:** A poor choice for the next CEO could lead to a loss of investor confidence and a decline in the stock price.

**11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

Based on the available information, the primary catalyst for Six Flags is the successful integration of Cedar Fair and the realization of the associated synergies. While there are near-term headwinds and execution risks, the potential upside from a successful integration and debt reduction is significant. Investors should monitor the company's progress on these fronts closely, as they will be the key drivers of the stock's performance over the next 12-24 months.
