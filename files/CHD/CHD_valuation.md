### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | 1.0% | Midpoint of management's 0% to 2% guidance for 2025. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 1, 2025). |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)** | 3.0% | Assumes a modest recovery from the weak 2025 consumer environment, trending below the 3-year historical CAGR of 5.6% (Calculated from 2021-2024 10-K filings) to remain conservative. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 18.6% | 3-year average adjusted EBIT margin (2022-2024), held flat as specific drivers for margin expansion were not detailed. (Calculated from 2022-2024 10-K filings). |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 23.0% | Based on direct management guidance. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 1, 2025). |
| **Capex (% of Revenue)** | 2.1% (Y1), 2.0% (Y2-5) | Year 1 based on $130M guidance. Years 2-5 align with management's stated target. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 1, 2025). |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |

| Method | Value | Calculation & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| Exit Multiple (EV/EBITDA) | 16.0x | A reasonable multiple in line with the historical range for a stable consumer staples company. |
| **Exit Multiple TV** | **$24,955 M** | `$1,559.7 M * 16.0` |
| **Selected Terminal Value** | **$24,955 M** | The lower of the two values is chosen for conservatism, as per instructions. |

| Add: Cash & Equivalents | $1,075 | Q1 2025 10-Q (May 1, 2025) |
| **Equity Value** | **$21,632** | `$22,762 - $2,205 + $1,075` |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Key Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$87.23** | **`$21,632 M / 248.0 M shares`** |
| Low/Bear Case | ~$75 | Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 2.0%) and margin compression of 100 bps due to competitive pressure and cost inflation. |
| High/Bull Case | ~$100 | Assumes stronger revenue growth (e.g., 4.0%) and margin expansion of 100 bps from successful innovation and cost controls. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (25%)** | **$65.42** | `$87.23 * (1 - 0.25)` |

### **Risk Notes**

The valuation is subject to several key risks. First, **competitive pressure** from both branded and private label products could compress margins and limit pricing power, particularly in the vitamin and water flosser categories. Second, **input cost volatility** for raw materials and transportation could erode profitability if not fully offset by price increases or productivity gains. Third, a prolonged **weakening of consumer discretionary spending** could negatively impact sales volumes for higher-priced or non-essential products more than anticipated. Finally, the company's growth relies on the successful **integration of acquisitions** and continued **international expansion**, both of which carry execution risk.

final answer is 87.23 $
