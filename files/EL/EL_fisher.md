**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL) operates in the global prestige beauty market, with products in skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care. While facing challenges in established markets like China and North America, the company is focusing on emerging markets for growth. India, in particular, is identified as a "priority emerging market" with a luxury beauty market expected to grow significantly. The company's strategy includes geographic expansion, channel diversification (especially online), and strategic acquisitions to broaden its consumer base. The company's 2024 10-K report acknowledges softness in some areas but emphasizes a long-term strategy focused on global growth.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K filing outlines a strategy of marketing and promoting products through distinctive brands. Estée Lauder's research and development (R&D) group works closely with marketing and product development teams to generate ideas, develop new products and product-line extensions, and improve existing products. The company also pursues strategic acquisitions to strengthen its brand portfolio, such as the recent acquisition of the remaining interest in DECIEM Beauty Group Inc. in May 2024. The company's Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP), launched in November 2023, is designed to drive future growth through brand expansion and strategic investments.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Estée Lauder's R&D costs totaled $360 million in fiscal 2024, an increase from $344 million in 2023 and $307 million in 2022, as detailed in its 2024 10-K. As of June 30, 2024, the company had approximately 1,430 employees in R&D. The company believes it is an industry leader in new product development and maintains relationships with scientific and educational institutions to supplement its internal capabilities. While the company does not disclose specific metrics like patents or launch success rates, its continued investment and focus on innovation suggest a commitment to R&D.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Estée Lauder sells its products in approximately 150 countries and territories through a diverse network of channels, including department stores, specialty-multi retailers, and its own websites. This global and multi-channel presence is a key strength. The company emphasizes a "High-Touch" service model, providing personalized consumer experiences. The 2024 10-K highlights the company's strategy of building strong relationships with retailers and connecting directly with consumers through various platforms. However, recent sales declines in key markets like China and North America raise questions about the current effectiveness of the sales organization in adapting to changing market dynamics.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, Estée Lauder's gross margin was 71.7%, an increase from 71.3% in fiscal 2023. The operating margin, however, decreased to 6.2% in fiscal 2024 from 9.5% in fiscal 2023. These figures are detailed in the company's 2024 10-K filing. The decline in operating margin was attributed to goodwill and other intangible asset impairments, as well as increased operating expenses as a percentage of sales. While the gross margin remains high, the significant drop in operating margin indicates pressure on profitability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Estée Lauder has launched a Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP) to rebuild profit margins in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The plan focuses on improving gross margin, lowering the cost base, and reducing overhead expenses, with expected net benefits of between $1.1 billion and $1.4 billion. As a part of this plan, a restructuring program was announced in February 2024, targeting annual gross benefits of $350 million to $500 million. The company is also implementing strategic pricing actions. These initiatives are detailed in the 2024 10-K report.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFl_H-f-qX2VEqCbPzUrVCZahMnfpMSSa_mDBLqQrqrT2eDNPuw8k1I_bCAGOh612WoNkL_-I-Dos2h6Dm78WasnHTNH2BNFmMdWXRXapXc3XzksRurQjjXjspr-p0itslO39Ee0c4QGpAcR2-C2ftqvdEGvNdi23QDeOS2_zPDhxz9kzX6MjCnCJJHxes=']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2024, Estée Lauder had approximately 62,000 employees worldwide. The company's 2024 10-K reports that a limited number of employees outside the U.S. are covered by works council agreements or other syndicate arrangements, and no U.S. employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The company emphasizes its commitment to an inclusive and diverse workplace and offers competitive compensation and benefits. However, the announced restructuring plan, which includes a net reduction of 1,800 to 3,000 positions, could potentially impact employee morale and relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Lauder family maintains significant control over the company, holding approximately 84% of the voting power as of August 12, 2024. Several Lauder family members hold key executive and board positions, which could indicate stability but also raises corporate governance questions. The 2024 10-K lists numerous executive officers with long tenures at the company, suggesting a stable leadership team. However, the company has also announced upcoming changes in key positions, including a new Chief Financial Officer.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K report provides a list of executive officers beyond the CEO, including heads of global supply chain, research and development, and international operations, as well as executive group presidents. This indicates a distributed leadership structure with experienced individuals in key roles. The company has also announced a successor for the current CFO, suggesting a focus on succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from management on internal control over financial reporting, stating that, as of June 30, 2024, the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective. The independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. However, the 10-K also notes the correction of misstatements in prior-period financial statements related to the allocation of net sales and operating income between product categories.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Estée Lauder's portfolio of well-established, high-end brands gives it a strong competitive advantage in the prestige beauty industry. The company's "High-Touch" service model and focus on premium products differentiate it from mass-market competitors. The company's global reach and distribution network, particularly in travel retail, have historically been key strengths. However, the company has recently faced challenges in this channel and in key markets like China, indicating that its competitive advantages may be eroding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE5jDJslWsts17fphDOOrRGRhPNSVq3gHqlxv97k8TFzg2BV4m3JtFXVBbtsvkUsvCUMe2dNh_EqcDuu1JpnwSAvFkg2RU9L1_eCZ4ENHxUURA0fg4a09a0dUBoDJPsPIJ6GA9AL_BVTSmENjMNK-9EnEZEYXOwzt5O1Cxf7cEJIA=']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states that its long-term strategy involves investments in new capabilities, brands, and geographic markets, which may result in short-term costs but are expected to lead to long-term growth. The company's Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP) is a multi-year initiative aimed at rebuilding profitability. This willingness to undertake significant restructuring and investment for future gains suggests a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2024, Estée Lauder had $3.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company generated $2.4 billion in net cash from operating activities in fiscal 2024. While the company has a significant amount of debt, its strong cash flow and access to credit markets suggest it can fund its growth initiatives without significant equity dilution. The 2024 10-K indicates that the company believes its current financial resources are adequate to support its operations and strategic plans.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 10-K, Estée Lauder openly discusses the challenges it faces, including softness in the prestige beauty market in mainland China and Asia travel retail, as well as competitive pressures in North America. The company has also been transparent about its restructuring plans and the expected financial impacts. This willingness to acknowledge and discuss challenges suggests a degree of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Lauder family's significant control over the company could present potential conflicts of interest. However, there are no recent, major legal or regulatory actions cited in the provided documents that would question the integrity of the current management team. The 2024 10-K includes a code of conduct and outlines corporate governance practices. The company has been in business for over 75 years, suggesting a long-term commitment to maintaining its reputation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001250/000100125024000116/el-20240630.htm']

---
**Synthesis:**
Estée Lauder's strongest positives from a Fisher perspective are its commitment to product development and long-range profitability, its strong brand portfolio, and its stable, experienced management team. The company is taking clear steps to address its recent performance issues through the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. However, recent sales declines, shrinking profit margins, and a large-scale restructuring that includes job cuts are significant negatives. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of the PRGP in restoring profitable growth, the recovery of the Asian travel retail market, and the company's ability to regain momentum in the North American market. A "No" on profit margins could flip to a "Yes" if the PRGP delivers its targeted savings and the company demonstrates sustained margin expansion. Similarly, a "No" on the sales organization could change if the company demonstrates a return to consistent, broad-based sales growth.

**fisher score is 9 / 15**
