### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
    *   **Type:** Corporate Action
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CarMax has a share repurchase program with $1.94 billion remaining for future repurchases as of February 28, 2025. The execution of this program would reduce the number of outstanding shares, thereby increasing earnings per share (EPS).
    *   **Mechanism:** A reduction in the number of shares outstanding directly increases EPS, assuming net income remains constant. A higher EPS is generally perceived positively by the market and can lead to a higher stock price, assuming a constant P/E multiple.
    *   **Timing:** Ongoing, with potential for acceleration in the next 0-12 months.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** Repurchase of $500 million in shares. At an assumed average price of $80/share, this would retire 6.25 million shares.
        *   **Base Scenario:** Repurchase of $1 billion in shares. At an assumed average price of $80/share, this would retire 12.5 million shares.
        *   **High Scenario:** Repurchase of $1.5 billion in shares. At an assumed average price of $80/share, this would retire 18.75 million shares.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). The repurchase of a significant number of shares could lead to a meaningful increase in EPS and signal management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a history of share repurchases and a large remaining authorization.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price, market conditions, and cash flow generation will influence the pace of repurchases.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
        *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q and 10-K filings.
        *   Company announcements regarding the share repurchase program.
        *   Daily trading volume and price of KMX stock.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
        *   A significant downturn in the business could lead to a suspension of the repurchase program.
        *   Management may choose to allocate capital to other priorities, such as acquisitions or debt reduction.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of share repurchases in upcoming quarterly reports.

**2. Catalyst Title:** CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) Full-Spectrum Lending Expansion
    *   **Type:** Financial
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CarMax is expanding its in-house financing arm, CAF, to capture a larger portion of the loans made to its customers across the credit spectrum. Management expects to grow CAF penetration by 100 to 150 basis points in the near-term.
    *   **Mechanism:** By originating more loans in-house, CarMax can capture more of the financing profit that would otherwise go to third-party lenders. This would increase CAF's income and contribute to overall net income growth.
    *   **Timing:** Ongoing, with continued expansion expected over the next 0-12 months.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** 100 basis point increase in CAF penetration.
        *   **Base Scenario:** 125 basis point increase in CAF penetration.
        *   **High Scenario:** 150 basis point increase in CAF penetration.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%). A successful expansion of CAF could lead to a significant increase in profitability and a higher valuation for the company.
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. Management has expressed confidence in this initiative and has already begun testing new credit models.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The success of the new credit scoring models, the ability to fund the increased loan volume, and the overall health of the consumer credit market.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
        *   CAF penetration rate in quarterly earnings reports.
        *   CAF income and net interest margin.
        *   Delinquency and loss rates in the CAF portfolio.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
        *   An increase in loan losses could offset the benefits of higher penetration.
        *   Competition from third-party lenders could limit CAF's ability to grow its market share.
        *   A deterioration in the macroeconomic environment could lead to a decline in consumer credit quality.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor CAF's key performance indicators in quarterly reports.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Cost Reduction and Efficiency Gains
    *   **Type:** Operational
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Management is focused on driving down the cost of goods sold through efficiency opportunities in logistics and reconditioning. They achieved savings of approximately $125 per unit in fiscal 2025 and anticipate at least another $125 per unit in savings in fiscal 2026.
    *   **Mechanism:** Lowering the cost of goods sold directly increases the gross profit per vehicle. This can either be passed on to customers to drive sales volume or retained to improve margins and profitability.
    *   **Timing:** Ongoing, with continued benefits expected over the next 0-12 months.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** $100 per unit in additional cost savings.
        *   **Base Scenario:** $125 per unit in additional cost savings.
        *   **High Scenario:** $150 per unit in additional cost savings.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-15%). While significant, the impact of these cost savings is likely to be smaller than the other two catalysts, as it is an incremental improvement to the existing business.
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. Management has a track record of achieving cost savings and has provided specific guidance for fiscal 2026.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The ability to identify and implement further efficiency improvements in the reconditioning and logistics processes.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
        *   Gross profit per used and wholesale vehicle in quarterly earnings reports.
        *   Management commentary on cost-saving initiatives.
        *   Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
        *   Inflationary pressures could offset some of the efficiency gains.
        *   Unexpected disruptions to the supply chain or logistics network.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor gross profit margins and management commentary on efficiency initiatives.

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Market Share Gains in a Fragmented Industry
    *   **Type:** Operational
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CarMax is the largest retailer of used vehicles in a highly fragmented market, with a market share of approximately 3.7% of 0-10 year old vehicles sold in the U.S. in calendar 2024. The company's omni-channel strategy and scale provide a significant competitive advantage that could enable it to continue to gain market share over the long term.
    *   **Mechanism:** As CarMax gains market share, it can leverage its scale to further reduce costs, improve its customer offering, and increase its profitability. This can create a virtuous cycle of growth and value creation.
    *   **Timing:** Ongoing, over the next 12-60 months.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** Market share increases to 4.5% in 5 years.
        *   **Base Scenario:** Market share increases to 5.0% in 5 years.
        *   **High Scenario:** Market share increases to 5.5% in 5 years.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A significant increase in market share could lead to a substantial increase in revenue and profitability, which would be reflected in a higher stock price.
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. CarMax has a strong track record of gaining market share and a clear strategy for future growth.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The continued success of the omni-channel strategy, the ability to open new stores and expand into new markets, and the overall health of the used car market.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
        *   Market share data from third-party sources.
        *   Comparable store sales growth.
        *   New store opening and performance.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
        *   Increased competition from other large used car retailers or new entrants to the market.
        *   A shift in consumer preferences away from the CarMax model.
        *   A prolonged downturn in the used car market.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The long-term market share opportunity is a key reason to own the stock.

### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. CAF Full-Spectrum Lending Expansion:**
*   **Assumption:** A 150 basis point increase in CAF penetration leads to an additional $150 million in annual pre-tax income.
*   **Formula:** (Additional Pre-tax Income \* (1 - Tax Rate)) / Shares Outstanding = Additional EPS
*   **Calculation:** ($150,000,000 \* (1 - 0.25)) / 153,319,678 = $0.73 additional EPS.
*   **Price Impact:** At a 15x P/E multiple, this would imply an additional $10.95 in share price, or a ~13% increase from an assumed $85 share price.

**2. Share Repurchase Program:**
*   **Assumption:** The company repurchases $1.5 billion of stock at an average price of $85 per share.
*   **Formula:** Repurchase Amount / Average Share Price = Shares Repurchased
*   **Calculation:** $1,500,000,000 / $85 = 17,647,059 shares repurchased. This would reduce the share count by ~11.5%.
*   **Price Impact:** A 11.5% reduction in share count would lead to a ~13% increase in EPS (1 / (1 - 0.115) = 1.13), which could translate to a similar increase in the stock price, all else being equal.

### **Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for CarMax appear to be net positive. The combination of an aggressive share repurchase program, the expansion of the profitable in-house financing arm, and a focus on cost reduction should provide a tailwind for the stock over the next 0-12 months. The successful execution of these initiatives could lead to a significant increase in EPS and a re-rating of the stock by the market.

### **Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A severe recession:** A significant downturn in the economy could lead to a sharp decline in used car sales and a rise in loan losses, which would negatively impact all of CarMax's key business segments.
2.  **A sharp increase in interest rates:** Higher interest rates would increase the cost of financing for customers, which could reduce demand for used cars and hurt CAF's profitability.
3.  **A major operational misstep:** A failure to execute on key initiatives, such as the CAF expansion or the cost reduction program, could lead to a loss of confidence from investors and a decline in the stock price.

### **Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on this analysis, the outlook for CarMax is positive, with several near-term catalysts that could drive the stock price higher. The expansion of the CarMax Auto Finance business and the company's aggressive share repurchase program are the two most significant catalysts to watch. A successful execution of these initiatives could lead to a 10-25% upside in the stock price over the next 12 months. Investors should closely monitor the company's quarterly earnings reports for progress on these fronts, with a particular focus on the CAF penetration rate and the pace of share repurchases.
