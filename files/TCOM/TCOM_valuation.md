**4) Forecast & Assumptions (5 Years)**

    *   Year 1: 10% (Conservative haircut to the Q1 2025 growth rate of 16%)
    *   Years 2-5: 8%, 6%, 4%, 2% (Gradual fade to a conservative terminal growth rate)
*   **Operating Margin:** 25.44% (Held flat at the FY2023 level, a conservative assumption).
*   **Taxes:** 15% (Slightly above the TTM effective tax rate of 13.02% for conservatism).
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   Capex: 1.1% of revenue (Consistent with FY2024).
    *   D&A: 2.0% of revenue (Consistent with FY2024).
    *   Working Capital: 6.0% of incremental revenue (Consistent with FY2024).
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-based compensation is treated as a real cash expense and is included in operating expenses, thus reducing operating income.

**5) Free Cash Flow Build**

*   **Formula:** FCFF = Operating Income * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital

**6) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.28% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, August 20, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 6.0% (Conservative estimate)
    *   Beta: 1.2 (Conservative assumption for a cyclical industry)
    *   Cost of Equity = 4.28% + 1.2 * 6.0% = 11.48%
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Average Debt = 211 / ((5,938 + 5,600)/2) = 3.6% (using prior year debt as an approximation for average debt)
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.6% * (1 - 0.15) = 3.06%
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Cap (approx.) = 43,890 USD million
    *   WACC = (E/(E+D)) * Ke + (D/(E+D)) * Kd * (1-t) = (43,890 / (43,890 + 5,938)) \* 11.48% + (5,938 / (43,890 + 5,938)) \* 3.06% = **10.21%**

**7) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Model:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (Conservative long-term inflation proxy)
    *   Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (2,295 * 1.025) / (10.21% - 2.5%) = 30,517 USD million
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Terminal EBIT = 2,606 USD million
    *   Implied Exit Multiple = 30,517 / 2,606 = 11.7x (A reasonable multiple for a mature company in this sector)
