### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Initial Benefits from Expanded Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP)
*   **Type:** Operational / Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On February 3, 2025, the company expanded its existing PRGP, which now includes a larger restructuring program focused on procurement, supply chain efficiencies, and outsourcing. The program is expected to result in total restructuring charges of $1.2 billion to $1.6 billion and a net reduction of 5,800 to 7,000 positions.
*   **Mechanism:** Realization of early cost savings from the program could improve gross and operating margins faster than anticipated, leading to upward revisions in earnings guidance and a higher stock valuation based on improved profitability. The stated goal is to enable a return to a double-digit operating margin over the next few years.
*   **Timing:** Now - June 30, 2026. Specific initiatives under the expanded program began in Q3 fiscal 2025 and are expected to be approved by the end of fiscal 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company realizes 25% of the low-end annual gross benefit target ($800M) within the next 12 months, adding $200M to gross profit.
    *   **Base Case:** The company realizes 35% of the mid-point annual gross benefit target ($900M) within the next 12 months, adding $315M to gross profit.
    *   **High Case:** The company realizes 45% of the high-end annual gross benefit target ($1.0B) within the next 12 months, adding $450M to gross profit.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). The base case of ~$315M in annual run-rate savings represents a ~32% increase over FY2024 operating income of $970M, which could drive a significant re-rating of the stock if achieved.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has committed to the plan and provided specific financial targets in its SEC filings. Execution risk exists, but the commitment is firm.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful execution of workforce reductions and process changes without disrupting core operations. Stable or improving end-market demand to leverage the leaner cost structure.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly restructuring charges incurred (reported in 10-Q).
    *   Gross Margin percentage (reported in 10-Q).
    *   Operating Margin percentage (reported in 10-Q).
    *   Management commentary on PRGP savings realization (Earnings Calls).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Execution delays or higher-than-expected restructuring costs.
    *   Negative impact on employee morale and innovation.
    *   Savings are offset by continued revenue declines or inflationary pressures.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor quarterly earnings for concrete evidence of margin improvement directly attributable to the PRGP.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Substantial Insider Purchases Signal Confidence
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Director Paul J. Fribourg made multiple large purchases of EL stock, acquiring over 400,000 shares for more than $30 million between November 2024 and February 2025. These purchases occurred when the stock price was significantly depressed.
*   **Mechanism:** Large, open-market insider buying can signal to the market that those with the most information believe the stock is undervalued. This can attract new investors, increase confidence in a turnaround, and provide a floor for the stock price.
*   **Timing:** The event has occurred. The signaling impact is effective now and over the next 0-12 months as the turnaround story is monitored.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Director Paul J. Fribourg purchased:
        *   157,000 shares for ~$10.0M (Nov 13, 2024)
        *   153,000 shares for ~$9.9M (Nov 15, 2024)
        *   77,800 shares for ~$5.0M (Nov 19, 2024)
        *   87,000 shares for ~$5.7M (Feb 5, 2025)
        *   45,500 shares for ~$3.0M (Feb 7, 2025)
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (~0–10%). While a strong positive signal, it is unlikely to be a primary driver of a major re-rating on its own. It serves more as a supporting factor for a broader recovery thesis.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 100%. The transactions are publicly filed and confirmed.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The positive signal must be validated by improving company fundamentals (sales, margins) for the impact to be sustained.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Further insider filings on OpenInsider or SEC Form 4 database.
    *   Share price performance relative to peers following the purchases.
    *   Analyst commentary referencing the insider activity.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Subsequent insider selling by the same or other individuals could negate the signal.
    *   Deteriorating company performance could render the signal irrelevant.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The director's actions provide a strong, timely signal of undervaluation, aligning with the early stages of the company's major turnaround plan.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Resumption of Share Repurchase Program
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company suspended its share repurchase program in December 2022. As of June 30, 2024, approximately 25.1 million shares remained authorized for repurchase under the existing plan.
*   **Mechanism:** Reinstating the buyback program would signal management's confidence in future cash flows and that it views the stock as undervalued. Repurchases would be accretive to EPS by reducing the share count and would create incremental demand for the stock.
*   **Timing:** 0-12 months. The decision to resume could be made at any quarterly board meeting, likely tied to progress on the PRGP and stabilization of cash flows.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Authorization:** 25,073,242 shares remaining as of June 30, 2024.
    *   **Scenario:** If the company were to repurchase 5 million shares over 12 months at an average price of $120/share, this would deploy $600 million of capital.
    *   **Accretion:** A 5 million share reduction from the diluted share count of ~360.8 million (FY2024) is a ~1.4% reduction, which would directly increase EPS by a similar amount, all else equal.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (~0–10%). The impact would depend on the size and pace of the repurchases. A modest program would be a positive signal, while a large, accelerated program could have a medium impact.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. Management has stated they "may resume such repurchases in the future." Resumption is likely contingent on improved financial performance and stability.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Stabilization of operating cash flow and confidence from the Board in the company's recovery trajectory.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Company press releases or 8-K filings announcing the program's resumption.
    *   "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" table in future 10-Q/10-K filings.
    *   Management commentary on capital allocation during earnings calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Continued business weakness could force the company to preserve cash, delaying the resumption.
    *   Management prioritizes debt paydown or M&A over repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a potential positive catalyst, but its timing is uncertain.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Full Realization of Profit Recovery and Growth Plan Benefits
*   **Type:** Financial / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The full execution of the expanded PRGP is expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2027, yielding annual gross benefits of between $800 million and $1.0 billion. The plan aims to rebuild margins, lower the cost base, and enable a return to double-digit operating margins.
*   **Mechanism:** Successfully achieving the targeted savings would fundamentally reset the company's profitability. An incremental ~$900M (midpoint) of gross benefit flowing to operating income would more than double the company's FY2024 operating income, significantly increasing EPS and intrinsic value, leading to a substantial share price increase.
*   **Timing:** July 1, 2026 - June 30, 2028 (Fiscal years 2027-2028). The benefits are expected to ramp up through FY2026 and be fully realized thereafter.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Baseline:** FY2024 Operating Income was $970 million.
    *   **Low Case:** Additional $800M in gross benefits translates to a ~$600M increase in operating income (assuming some reinvestment). New Operating Income: ~$1.57B.
    *   **Base Case:** Additional $900M in gross benefits translates to a ~$700M increase in operating income. New Operating Income: ~$1.67B.
    *   **High Case:** Additional $1.0B in gross benefits translates to an $800M increase in operating income. New Operating Income: ~$1.77B.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A doubling of the operating income base from FY2024 levels would be a transformational event for the stock's valuation, assuming even stable revenues.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. Management has a clear plan and has committed to it publicly. The primary uncertainty lies in the magnitude of the net benefit and the risk of unforeseen operational disruptions.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Sustained management focus through leadership transitions. Avoidance of major new market downturns. Ability to achieve savings without impairing brand equity or innovation pipeline.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Annual progress reports on PRGP targets in 10-K filings.
    *   Operating Margin trend vs. historical levels and peer group.
    *   Return on Invested Capital (ROIC).
    *   Management guidance for fiscal years 2026 and 2027.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant global recession erodes sales, masking the benefits of cost cuts.
    *   Savings prove to be unsustainable or are given back in the form of higher promotions to drive sales.
    *   Key talent departs due to restructuring, harming the company's competitive position.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is the central pillar of the long-term investment thesis. The potential for a structural reset in profitability is high, and the stock price does not appear to fully reflect the successful execution of this plan.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Market Share Gains and Margin Expansion from Fully Integrated DECIEM (The Ordinary)
*   **Type:** M&A / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company purchased the remaining interest in Deciem Beauty Group Inc. ("DECIEM") on May 31, 2024, making it a wholly-owned subsidiary. DECIEM's brands, particularly The Ordinary, are positioned in the high-growth, "masstige" and ingredient-focused skincare segment.
*   **Mechanism:** Full integration allows for greater synergies in supply chain, distribution, and R&D. Leveraging EL's global footprint to accelerate the international expansion of The Ordinary and NIOD can drive significant, high-margin revenue growth over the long term.
*   **Timing:** 12-60 months (Mid-2026 - Mid-2030).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   The Ordinary was noted as a source of net sales growth in FY2024, "driven by growth in every geographic region, reflecting new product launches, continued success of hero products, and targeted expanded consumer reach." (10-K, Aug 19, 2024)
    *   **Inference:** If DECIEM brands can grow from an estimated ~5-7% of sales to 10-15% of sales over 5 years at a higher-than-average corporate margin, it could contribute disproportionately to operating income growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (~10–30%). Sustained high growth from a key brand portfolio can offset weakness elsewhere and contribute meaningfully to the overall corporate growth rate and margin profile.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The Ordinary has a proven track record of growth and a strong brand following. The primary challenge is maintaining the brand's unique identity and momentum within a large corporate structure.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful global rollout without diluting brand equity. Retaining key talent from DECIEM. Effective supply chain integration.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Management commentary on the performance of The Ordinary and DECIEM brands in quarterly reports.
    *   Changes in Skincare category sales and margin mix.
    *   Evidence of expanded distribution in key markets (e.g., Asia, Latin America).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Increased competition in the ingredient-focused skincare space.
    *   Failure to integrate the "abnormal" culture of DECIEM, leading to brand stagnation.
    *   Cannibalization of other EL skincare brands.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The full ownership of a high-growth, disruptive brand is a significant long-term asset that complements the company's traditional prestige portfolio.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. PRGP Operating Income Impact:**
*   **Baseline:** FY2024 Operating Income = $970M. (10-K, Aug 19, 2024)
*   **Assumption:** The company achieves the base case of $700M in net operating profit improvement from the PRGP by FY2027.
*   **Formula:** Future Operating Income = Baseline OI + PRGP Benefit
*   **Calculation:** $970M + $700M = $1,670M
*   **Valuation Impact:** At a constant 15x EV/EBIT multiple, this ~72% increase in operating income could plausibly drive a commensurate increase in the company's enterprise value and share price, all else being equal.

**2. Asia Travel Retail Recovery Impact:**
*   **Baseline:** Asia/Pacific segment Net Sales for the nine months ended Mar 31, 2024, was $3,683M, which declined to $3,371M for the nine months ended Mar 31, 2025. (10-Q, May 1, 2025) This represents a decline of $312M. A significant portion of the EMEA decline is also attributable to Asia travel retail.
*   **Assumption:** The company recovers 50% of lost high-margin travel retail sales over two years, adding back ~$500M in annual revenue at a high incremental operating margin (e.g., 30%).
*   **Formula:** Additional Operating Income = Recovered Sales * Incremental Margin
*   **Calculation:** $500M * 30% = $150M
*   **Valuation Impact:** An additional $150M in operating income represents a ~15% increase over the FY2024 baseline. This alone could drive a 10-20% share price increase, demonstrating the high sensitivity to a recovery in this specific channel.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term (0-12 months) outlook is balanced but tilting positive, contingent on execution. The primary positive driver is the aggressive PRGP, which should begin to yield tangible margin improvements in upcoming quarters. This is strongly supported by the significant insider buying, which provides a powerful vote of confidence. However, these are set against a challenging macro backdrop, with continued softness in the critical Asia travel retail and mainland China markets, which could mute the bottom-line benefits of the restructuring. A resumption of the buyback would be a clear positive signal, but its timing is uncertain. Overall, the market signal is one of a potential turnaround; positive performance is likely if PRGP execution milestones are met and communicated effectively, even if the macro environment in China remains soft.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Prolonged and Deepening Downturn in China:** A further deterioration in Chinese consumer sentiment and travel spending could overwhelm the benefits of the PRGP, leading to continued revenue declines that make margin targets impossible to achieve. (Risk described in 10-Q)
2.  **Failed Execution of the PRGP:** The restructuring and outsourcing initiatives could lead to operational chaos, loss of key talent, and a decline in innovation or brand equity, causing the plan to fail to deliver the projected savings while simultaneously damaging the top line. (General risk of strategy execution from 10-K)
3.  **Intensified Global Competition:** Aggressive pricing and innovation from competitors like L'Oreal and LVMH, particularly in the recovering skincare and fragrance categories, could lead to market share losses that offset any internal improvements. (Risk described in 10-K)

---

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

Based on the analysis, the investment recommendation is **Buy** for investors with a 24-60 month horizon. The central catalyst is the aggressive Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP), which has the potential to structurally reset the company's profitability and drive a large (>30%) upside in the share price upon successful execution. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly evolution of the company's operating margin, as this will be the first and clearest evidence that the PRGP is delivering on its transformative promise.
