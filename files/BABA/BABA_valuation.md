### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | 7.0% -> 5.0% | No direct guidance. Based on TTM growth of 5.9% and management's commentary on "accelerated growth" in core segments like AI Cloud. A fade-down to 5.0% by Year 5 reflects increasing scale. |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin** | 15.22% | Held constant at the TTM level, as no specific margin expansion initiatives were detailed by management. (Calculated from Baseline Financials) |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 21.96% | Based on the TTM effective tax rate. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 8.63% | Based on the TTM average (11,941 / 138,382 USD). (Calculated from Baseline Financials) |
| **Change in NWC as % of Î” Revenue** | -2.00% | Based on historical averages, assumes efficient working capital management as the company grows. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 1.40% | Held constant at the TTM average. (Calculated from Baseline Financials) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD, millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 148,069 | 156,953 | 165,585 | 174,743 | 183,480 |
| *Growth Rate* | *7.0%* | *6.0%* | *5.5%* | *5.5%* | *5.0%* |
| EBIT | 22,536 | 23,888 | 25,202 | 26,596 | 27,927 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *15.22%* | *15.22%* | *15.22%* | *15.22%* | *15.22%* |
| Tax on EBIT | (4,950) | (5,246) | (5,534) | (5,841) | (6,133) |
| **NOPAT** | **17,586** | **18,642** | **19,668** | **20,755** | **21,794** |
| Add: D&A | 6,367 | 6,750 | 7,123 | 7,512 | 7,888 |
| Less: Stock-Based Comp | (2,073) | (2,197) | (2,318) | (2,446) | (2,569) |
| Less: Capex | (12,778) | (13,546) | (14,289) | (15,080) | (15,833) |
| Less: Change in NWC | (194) | (178) | (173) | (183) | (187) |
| **Free Cash Flow to Firm** | **8,908** | **9,471** | **9,911** | **10,558** | **11,093** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | | **CAPM = Rf + Beta * ERP** |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.29% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. (TradingEconomics, August 21, 2025) |
| Beta (5-Year) | 0.16 | This beta is low, reflecting stock-specific factors (regulatory pressure) over the past 5 years more than market volatility. It is used for consistency but acknowledged as a potential source of undervaluation for the discount rate. (StockAnalysis, August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.50% | Standard assumption for a mature, global company. |
| *Calculated Ke* | *5.17%* | |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | | **Interest Expense / Avg. Debt** |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 3.87% | Calculated from TTM financials (1,333 / 34,460). |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 3.02% | Kd * (1 - Tax Rate) = 3.87% * (1 - 0.2196) |
| **WACC** | | **(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd)** |
| Market Cap of Equity (E) | 267,270M | (StockAnalysis, August 21, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | 34,460M | (Calculated from Baseline Financials) |
| Total Value (V) | 301,730M | |
| *Calculated WACC* | **4.92%** | |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Inputs | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method** | Terminal FCFF: $11,093 * (1 + 2.5%) = $11,370M | TV = $11,370 / (4.92% - 2.50%) = **$470,022M** |
| *Terminal Growth Rate (g)* | *2.5%* | *Represents a reasonable long-term inflation expectation.* |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | | |
| Year 5 EBITDA | NOPAT + D&A = $21,794 + $7,888 = $29,682M | A historical median EV/EBITDA multiple for BABA is ~10-15x. Applying a conservative 12x multiple yields a TV of 12 * $29,682M = **$356,184M**. |

*Decision:* The Gordon Growth method results in a higher terminal value. Given the discrepancy, the more conservative Exit Multiple cross-check value of **$356,184M** will be used to reduce estimation risk.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Calculation | Value (USD, mm) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Explicit FCFF** | PV of Y1-Y5 FCFF discounted at 4.92% | 43,450 |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | $356,184 / (1 + 4.92%)^5 | 279,776 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **Sum of PVs** | **323,226** |
| Less: Total Debt | | (34,460) |
| Add: Cash & Equivalents | | 59,457 |
| **Equity Value** | | **348,223** |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Key Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case Fair Value** | **$144.20** | Equity Value / Diluted Shares ($348,223M / 2,415M) |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$108** | Slower Revenue Growth (4%), Margin Compression (14% EBIT), Lower Exit Multiple (10x) |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$185** | Higher Revenue Growth (9%), Stable Margins, Higher Exit Multiple (14x) |
| | | |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price** | **$108.15** | 25% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value. |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory Risk:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the geopolitical and regulatory environment in China. Future government interventions could impact operations, profitability, and investor sentiment, invalidating growth and margin assumptions.
2.  **Competition:** Alibaba faces intense competition in e-commerce (PDD, JD.com) and cloud computing. Failure to maintain market share or pricing power could lead to lower-than-forecasted growth and margins.
3.  **Beta Underestimation:** The 5-year beta of 0.16 is historically low due to stock-specific price declines, not a lack of market correlation. This results in a low WACC (4.92%). A higher, more normalized beta would increase the WACC and lower the intrinsic value estimate significantly.
4.  **Economic Slowdown:** A prolonged economic slowdown in China could materially impact consumer spending and enterprise cloud adoption, reducing revenue below the base-case forecast.
5.  **VIE Structure Risk:** The Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure presents unique risks to foreign investors, who own shares in a Cayman Islands-based entity with contractual rights to profits, not direct ownership in the Chinese operating company.

final answer is 144.20 $
