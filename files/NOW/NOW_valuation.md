### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Forecast Period** | 5 Years (FY2025 - FY2029) | Standard explicit forecast horizon. |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | **19.5%** | Based on the midpoint of management's 2025 constant currency growth guidance. |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)**| **17.5%, 16.0%, 14.5%, 13.0%** | A gradual step-down from guided growth, reflecting maturation at scale. |
| **EBIT Margin** | **14.0%**, expanding to **16.0%** | Starting with a normalized TTM EBIT margin and expanding by 50bps annually, a conservative adjustment from the higher non-GAAP operating margin guidance to reflect ongoing SBC. |
| **Tax Rate** | **19.0%** | A normalized effective tax rate, slightly above the most recent quarter's rate to be conservative. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue**| **5.2%** | TTM average. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **15.3%** | TTM average. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue**| **7.0%** | TTM average. |
| **ΔWC as % of ΔRev** | **-1.3%** | TTM average, reflecting an efficient working capital model. |

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, Millions) | Y1 (2025E) | Y2 (2026E) | Y3 (2027E) | Y4 (2028E) | Y5 (2029E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $14,408 | $16,929 | $19,638 | $22,486 | $25,409 |
| EBIT | $2,017 | $2,455 | $2,946 | $3,485 | $4,065 |
| NOPAT | $1,634 | $1,988 | $2,386 | $2,823 | $3,293 |
| D&A | $749 | $880 | $1,021 | $1,169 | $1,321 |
| SBC | ($2,204) | ($2,590) | ($3,005) | ($3,440) | ($3,887) |
| Capex | ($1,009) | ($1,185) | ($1,375) | ($1,574) | ($1,779) |
| Δ in Work. Cap. | ($31) | ($33) | ($35) | ($38) | ($42) |
| **FCFF** | **($800)** | **($874)** | **($938)** | **($985)** | **($1,010)** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

| Component | Value | Citation/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.30% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 19, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.00% | Standard market premium for a mature market. |
| Beta (β) | 0.95 | 5-Year Beta, reflects market volatility alignment. |
| *Cost of Equity (Ke)* | *9.05%* | *Formula: Rf + β * ERP = 4.30% + 0.95 * 5.00%* |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt (Kd) | 1.54% | TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $23M / $1,490M |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 1.25% | *Formula: Kd * (1 - Tax Rate) = 1.54% * (1 - 0.19)* |
| **WACC Calculation** | | |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $184,020 M | Market Cap as of August 2025. |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $1,490 M | Total Debt. |
| *WACC* | *8.99%* | *Formula: (E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-t)* |

### F) Terminal Value

1.  **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This is a conservative rate aligned with long-term inflation expectations.
    *   Terminal FCFF: Y5 FCFF * (1+g) = -$1,010 * (1.025) = -$1,035 M
    *   Terminal Value = Terminal FCFF / (WACC - g) = -$1,035 / (8.99% - 2.5%) = **-$15,951 M**

2.  **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   The negative FCFF projections make a standard exit multiple cross-check based on EBITDA not meaningful as it would result in a negative valuation. The Gordon Growth method, while also negative, is used as the primary approach based on the formulaic requirements, but highlights a significant valuation challenge. Given the discrepancy and the negative terminal value, we will proceed with the Gordon Growth method but acknowledge the model's limitations with the current assumptions. The lower of the two is chosen.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

| Component | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-Y5) | ($3,556) |
| PV of Terminal Value | ($9,878) |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **($13,434)** |
| Less: Total Debt | $1,490 |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents | $3,124 |
| *Less: Net Debt* | *($1,634)* |
| **Equity Value** | **($11,800)** |

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** The calculated equity value is negative, resulting in a **$0.00 per share** value. This indicates that under the current assumptions, the company's future cash flows do not support its current capital structure and valuation. The model is highly sensitive to the large negative impact of stock-based compensation when treated as a cash expense.

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** A scenario with lower revenue growth (e.g., 15% declining to 10%) and margin compression would result in an even more negative equity value, reinforcing a **$0.00 per share** value.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** A scenario with higher revenue growth (e.g., 22% declining to 15%) and significant margin expansion could potentially yield a positive, but likely still low, intrinsic value. However, given the baseline, this would require very optimistic assumptions not directly supported by current data.
    *   **Base Case:** **$0.00**

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** A margin of safety cannot be applied to a $0.00 value. The MOS price is **$0.00**.

### One-paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include its extreme sensitivity to the treatment of stock-based compensation (SBC). Treating the full TTM value of SBC as a cash outflow significantly impairs the free cash flow; if SBC were lower or treated as a non-cash item (contrary to instructions), the valuation would be positive. Second, the company's ability to achieve guided non-GAAP operating margins while managing GAAP expenses is critical; failure to expand real cash margins will pressure valuation. Third, revenue growth deceleration faster than modeled would further challenge the path to positive cash flow. Finally, a higher-than-expected beta or risk-free rate in the future could increase the WACC, further depressing the present value of future cash flows.

final answer is 0.00 $
