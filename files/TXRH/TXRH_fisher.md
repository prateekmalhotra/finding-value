Texas Roadhouse, Inc. analysis date: August 24, 2025. Primary sources reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K, Q3 2024 Form 10-Q, and Q1 2025 Form 10-Q.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse continues to expand its restaurant base in existing and new domestic and international markets. In fiscal year 2024, the company opened 31 company-owned restaurants and franchise partners opened 14 restaurants. For 2025, the company expects store week growth of approximately 5%, which includes a 2% benefit from the acquisition of 14 domestic franchise restaurants in Q1 2025. This steady unit growth, combined with consistent comparable restaurant sales growth (8.5% in 2024), demonstrates a strong and ongoing demand for its core casual dining concept.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively developing newer concepts alongside its flagship Texas Roadhouse brand. The company is expanding its Bubba's 33 concept (a full-service, casual dining restaurant) and its Jaggers concept (a fast-casual restaurant). As of December 31, 2024, there were 49 company-owned Bubba's 33 restaurants and 9 company-owned Jaggers restaurants. The company's 2025 development plan includes continued openings of these newer concepts, demonstrating a commitment to diversifying its growth drivers beyond the mature Texas Roadhouse brand. Capital expenditures are budgeted at approximately $400 million for 2025 to support this expansion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the restaurant industry, R&D equates to menu innovation, process improvements, and developing new concepts. Texas Roadhouse's R&D effectiveness is demonstrated by the successful expansion of Bubba's 33 and Jaggers, which have grown to 50 and 9 company restaurants respectively by Q1 2025. The company has also invested in technology to improve the guest experience and kitchen efficiency, such as a customized digital app for waitlisting and ordering, and digital kitchen display systems being rolled out to all domestic restaurants. These efforts support high sales volumes and reflect an effective development process relative to its size.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse's sales performance is consistently strong. For fiscal year 2024, the company reported a comparable restaurant sales increase of 8.5%, driven by a 4.4% increase in guest traffic and a 4.1% increase in average check. This growth continued into Q1 2025 with a comparable restaurant sales increase of 3.5%. The company's marketing strategy is heavily localized, empowering managing partners to engage with their communities rather than relying on national advertising, a model that has proven highly effective at driving traffic and sales.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse maintains solid profit margins for its industry. For fiscal year 2024, income from operations was 9.6% of total revenue, and net income attributable to the company was 8.1% of total revenue. Restaurant margin, a non-GAAP measure the company uses to evaluate restaurant-level performance, was 17.1% of restaurant sales in 2024, up from 15.4% in 2023. These figures represent a strong and improving ability to convert sales into profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on balancing costs while preserving its value proposition. The company implements modest menu price increases to offset inflation, such as the 1.4% increase planned for April 2025. Labor productivity initiatives and leveraging a higher average guest check have helped offset wage and commodity inflation. For example, in 2024, the benefit of a higher average guest check and labor productivity more than offset wage inflation of 4.6% and commodity inflation of 0.7%, leading to an increase in restaurant margin as a percentage of sales from 15.4% to 17.1%.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837024014095/txrh-20240924x10q.htm, November 1, 2024], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse emphasizes a "People-First" culture. It offers a performance-based compensation program for its restaurant managers and multi-restaurant operators ("managing partners" and "market partners"), which includes a percentage of their restaurant's pre-tax income, fostering an ownership mentality. The company also created Andy's Outreach, a non-profit funded mainly by employee contributions to provide financial support to employees in times of crisis, which has distributed over $30 million since its inception. These programs suggest a strong commitment to employee welfare and positive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a history of promotion from within. CEO Gerald L. Morgan has been with the company since 1997, holding various roles before his appointment in 2021. President Regina A. Tobin joined in 1996 and also rose through the ranks. This long tenure and internal promotion path for top leadership indicates a stable and cohesive executive environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses a full slate of executive officers beyond the CEO, including a President, Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, Chief Technology Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Communications Officer. The biographies provided in the 2024 10-K show that key leaders like the President and Chief Legal Officer have been with the company for over two decades, highlighting a deep bench of experienced talent that has been developed internally. The unique "market partner" system, which oversees groups of restaurants, creates a pipeline of experienced operational leaders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial filings provide detailed segment reporting for its Texas Roadhouse and Bubba's 33 concepts, including breakdowns of restaurant margin. The Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, concluded that internal controls were effective. The independent auditor, KPMG LLP, also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or significant accounting issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837024014095/txrh-20240924x10q.htm, November 1, 2024], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator for Texas Roadhouse is its "owner-operator partnership model." Managing partners and market partners are required to make a refundable deposit and receive a percentage of their restaurant's pre-tax income, which fosters an ownership mentality that drives performance and retention. Another unique aspect is the in-house meat-cutting program, where steaks are hand-cut daily on-premises, which reinforces a brand image of freshness and quality that is difficult for competitors to replicate at scale. The disciplined focus on dinner-only service on weekdays for most locations is another strategic choice that optimizes operations and staffing for peak profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a long-range outlook through its sustained investment in new restaurant concepts (Bubba's 33 and Jaggers) and significant capital expenditures for new unit growth and remodels, estimated at $400 million for 2025. Management’s discussion of pricing emphasizes a "disciplined" approach, balancing short-term pressures with "long-term growth while always keeping our guest top of mind," indicating a reluctance to maximize short-term profit at the expense of its value proposition. The continued development of new restaurant concepts, which require upfront investment and time to mature, also points to a focus on long-term, durable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is in a strong financial position to fund growth. As of April 1, 2025, the company had $221.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility. Operations are a significant source of cash, with net cash provided by operating activities totaling $753.6 million in fiscal 2024. The company consistently returns capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, having bought back $50.2 million in stock in Q1 2025. This demonstrates that the company can fund its capital expenditures (projected at $400 million for 2025) and return capital without needing to issue new shares.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections in the 10-K and 10-Q filings are comprehensive, openly discussing challenges such as commodity and wage inflation. For example, the filings provide specific figures for inflation (2.1% commodity and 4.6% wage inflation in Q1 2025) and detail how these pressures are affecting restaurant-level margins. The company also provides forward-looking expectations for these costs, anticipating 4% to 5% wage inflation for the remainder of 2025. This level of detail in official filings suggests a culture of transparency. However, a full assessment of candor would require analysis of earnings call transcripts, which were not accessible for this review.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025], [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/TXRH/transcripts/, August 24, 2025]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings reveals no material legal proceedings that would question management's integrity. The "Legal Proceedings" sections in the Q3 2024, FY 2024, and Q1 2025 reports state that while the company is occasionally a defendant in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business, none of it is expected to have a material adverse effect. The auditor's report is clean, and there are no disclosures of material weaknesses in internal controls. There are no apparent governance red flags or related-party transactions that suggest a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837024014095/txrh-20240924x10q.htm, November 1, 2024], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm, February 28, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025007082/txrh-20250401x10q.htm, May 9, 2025]

---
**Synthesis:**
Texas Roadhouse scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a well-managed company with a strong competitive position and clear growth strategy. The company's primary strengths lie in its distinct, owner-operator culture that drives strong sales and operational execution, its consistent and profitable unit growth, and its robust financial health that allows for self-funded expansion and shareholder returns. Management demonstrates a long-range perspective by developing new restaurant concepts to secure future growth runways. The key variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months are centered on margin performance and the growth of newer concepts. A sustained spike in commodity costs (particularly beef) or wage inflation that cannot be offset by productivity gains or modest price increases could pressure the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" score. Furthermore, the pace and unit economics of the Bubba's 33 and Jaggers expansion will be critical evidence for the "Commitment to Ongoing Development" and "R&D Effectiveness" points; any stumbles in their performance could turn those from a "Yes" to a "No."

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
