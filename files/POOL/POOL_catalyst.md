### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** As of February 20, 2025, Pool Corp. had $336.8 million remaining under its current share repurchase program. Consistent execution of this program would reduce the number of outstanding shares, directly increasing earnings per share (EPS).
*   **Mechanism:** A reduction in the number of shares outstanding increases EPS, which, with a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher share price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's value.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** 25% of the remaining authorization is used, repurchasing approximately $84.2 million in shares. At a hypothetical average price of $350/share, this would retire ~240,571 shares, or ~0.6% of the 37.6 million shares outstanding.
    *   **Base Case:** 50% of the remaining authorization is used, repurchasing $168.4 million in shares. At a hypothetical average price of $350/share, this would retire ~481,143 shares, or ~1.3% of shares outstanding.
    *   **High Case:** 75% of the remaining authorization is used, repurchasing $252.6 million in shares. At a hypothetical average price of $350/share, this would retire ~721,714 shares, or ~1.9% of shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). The impact would be a combination of the direct EPS accretion and the positive signal to investors.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has a history of executing its repurchase programs.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price not rising to a level where buybacks become unattractive to management and continued strong cash flow generation.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in the 10-Q and 10-K filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in the business could lead to the suspension of the repurchase program. A spike in the stock price could make repurchases less accretive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases in upcoming quarterly filings.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Increased Dividend Payout
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Pool Corp. has a strong history of increasing its dividend, with 19 increases between 2011 and 2024. A continuation of this trend is likely, signaling financial health and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Mechanism:** A dividend increase can attract income-focused investors and signals confidence from the Board of Directors in the company's future earnings power, potentially leading to a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** May 2026 (historically, the company has announced dividend increases in May).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** 5% increase in the quarterly dividend from the current level.
    *   **Base Case:** 10% increase in the quarterly dividend, in line with historical trends.
    *   **High Case:** 15% increase in the quarterly dividend, if management is particularly optimistic about future cash flows.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (1-3%). Dividend increases are often priced in by the market to some extent, but a larger-than-expected increase could provide a modest boost.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. Given the long track record, another increase is highly probable, though the magnitude is less certain.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued stable or growing free cash flow.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** The company's press releases in the second quarter of 2026.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant deterioration in business conditions could lead the Board to pause dividend increases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Market Share Gains Through Strategic Acquisitions
*   **Type:** M&A
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Pool Corp. has a history of growth through acquisitions and has stated its intention to continue to make strategic acquisitions to further penetrate existing markets and expand into new ones.
*   **Mechanism:** Successful acquisitions can be immediately accretive to earnings, provide synergies through cost savings and increased purchasing power, and expand the company's geographic footprint and customer base.
*   **Timing:** 12-60 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Acquisitions add 1-2% to annual revenue growth.
    *   **Base Case:** Acquisitions add 3-4% to annual revenue growth.
    *   **High Case:** A larger, more transformative acquisition that adds 5%+ to annual revenue growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%). The impact would depend on the size and profitability of the acquired companies.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a demonstrated ability to execute on this strategy.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Availability of suitable acquisition targets at reasonable valuations.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Company announcements of acquisitions and details of the transactions in SEC filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Overpaying for acquisitions, or difficulties with integration, could destroy shareholder value.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program Execution:**
*   **Assumptions:** Base case repurchase of $168.4 million at an average price of $350/share, reducing share count by 481,143.
*   **Formula:** (Current Market Cap / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) * EPS benefit adjustment
*   **Calculation:** Assuming a starting market cap of ~$13.2 billion and 37.6 million shares, the new share price would be ~$352. The EPS accretion would likely lead to a further price increase. A 1.3% reduction in share count, all else equal, would lead to a ~1.3% increase in EPS.

**2. Market Share Gains Through Strategic Acquisitions:**
*   **Assumptions:** Base case of 4% revenue growth from acquisitions, with a 10% operating margin on that new revenue.
*   **Formula:** (Acquired Revenue * Operating Margin * (1 - Tax Rate)) / Shares Outstanding = EPS accretion.
*   **Calculation:** ($5.3B * 0.04) * 0.10 * (1 - 0.25) / 37.6M = ~$0.42 additional EPS. At a 20x P/E multiple, this would imply an $8.40 increase in the share price, or about a 2.4% increase.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Pool Corp. are primarily related to corporate actions that return capital to shareholders. These actions are likely to provide a modest positive tailwind to the stock price. The more significant catalysts, such as a rebound in new pool construction and market share gains from acquisitions, are longer-term in nature. The short-term market signal is neutral to slightly positive, with the buybacks and dividend increase providing a floor for the stock, but a significant re-rating is unlikely without an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook for the pool industry.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A deep and prolonged recession:** This would severely impact consumer discretionary spending on new pools and major renovations, overwhelming the positive effects of any corporate actions.
2.  **A significant increase in interest rates:** This would make financing for new pools more expensive, further dampening demand.
3.  **A major operational misstep:** A failed large acquisition or a significant supply chain disruption could damage the company's profitability and reputation.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Pool Corporation presents a mixed catalyst profile. The most immediate and probable catalysts are corporate actions—share buybacks and dividend increases—that are likely to provide a small but steady tailwind to the stock, in the range of 3-8% combined. The most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly data on new pool construction permits, which will signal a potential recovery in the company's most cyclical and highest-margin business segment.
