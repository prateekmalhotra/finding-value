| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **Year 1: 3.0%**. This is based on the midpoint of Q3 guidance and recent performance. **Years 2-5: 2.0%**. Fading to a sustainable long-term growth rate reflecting a mature market. | |
| **Operating Margin** | **20.7% (Stable)**. Based on the TTM operating margin of 20.71%. No specific management guidance on margin expansion was available, so a stable margin is assumed. | |

| Beta (β) | 1.27 (5-Year Monthly Beta) | (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025) |

| **WACC** | **9.68%** | |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $47,691M (Current Price * Diluted Shares) | (Stock Price * 481M Shares) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $7,162M | |
| *WACC Formula* | *(E / (E+D)) * CoE + (D / (E+D)) * CoD * (1-T) = 86.9% * 10.64% + 13.1% * 3.03% = **9.64%*** | |

### One-paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include intensified competition from larger e-commerce players like Amazon and specialized marketplaces, which could pressure revenue growth and take rates. A significant downturn in global consumer discretionary spending would directly impact Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV). Furthermore, changes in search engine algorithms or an inability to innovate with AI and other technologies could diminish user engagement and seller effectiveness. Regulatory risks, particularly concerning online sales tax and data privacy, remain a persistent threat across jurisdictions. Lastly, failure to effectively manage its capital structure, including share buybacks and debt, could negatively impact shareholder returns.

final answer is 28.26 $
