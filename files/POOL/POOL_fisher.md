Company: Pool Corporation (POOL)
Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K (filed February 27, 2025), Q2 2025 Earnings Transcript (July 24, 2025).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pool Corp is the largest global wholesale distributor for an installed base of approximately 11 million swimming pools in the U.S. alone. A significant portion of its business (estimated at 64% of 2024 sales) is tied to non-discretionary maintenance and repair, providing a stable, recurring revenue stream that grows with the pool base. The company is also a leading distributor in the U.S. irrigation and landscape market, which it estimates has a total addressable market of $19.0 billion. Growth is supported by the aging of existing pools requiring renovation and by favorable demographic trends toward outdoor living.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** POOL actively expands its network and enhances its processes. The company's growth strategy includes opening 8-10 new sales centers in 2025 and pursuing strategic acquisitions to penetrate new and existing markets. Management is committed to digital transformation, investing heavily in its POOL360 suite of SaaS products, which includes tools for water testing and service business management to create efficiencies for its customers. This focus on technological integration and network expansion demonstrates a clear commitment to future growth beyond its core product lines.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a wholesale distributor, Pool Corp does not engage in traditional product research and development and does not report R&D expenditures. Its innovation focus is on process and technology, specifically its investment in a digital ecosystem (POOL360) to improve customer operations and loyalty. While these technological investments are strategic and create a competitive advantage, they do not fit Fisher's criteria of developing new proprietary products or manufacturing processes. Therefore, based on a strict interpretation, the evidence is not sufficient.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pool Corp is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies, operating 448 sales centers and serving approximately 125,000 customers. Its scale, geographic density, and comprehensive inventory of over 200,000 products create a significant competitive advantage over smaller regional and local distributors. The company provides extensive support to its customers, including marketing, training, and lead generation, functioning as a business partner rather than just a supplier. This market leadership and deep customer integration are clear evidence of an above-average sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal year 2024, POOL reported a gross margin of 29.7% and an operating margin of 11.6%. While this was a decrease from the prior year, its profitability remains superior to peers in adjacent distribution and building products industries. For comparison, competitor UFP Industries reported a net margin of 5.31%, while Beacon Roofing Supply had an operating margin of 4.26%. POOL’s ability to maintain double-digit operating margins demonstrates strong pricing power and operational efficiency for a distributor.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margins through several initiatives. The 2024 10-K cites "pricing optimization efforts" and securing higher volume-related purchase incentives from vendors as key actions. The company continues to promote its proprietary and private-label brands, such as NPT pool finishes, which typically yield higher margins than third-party products. Operationally, POOL is leveraging technology to enhance efficiency and manage variable costs, which supported margins during the recent period of sales normalization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company states its goal is to be an "Employer of Choice," focusing on employee engagement, development, and safety. As of December 31, 2024, none of its approximately 6,000 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, indicating a direct and stable relationship with its workforce. The company invests in employee growth through initiatives like its Manager Trainee (MIT) program and provides competitive compensation and benefits. While quantitative data on turnover is not disclosed, the detailed disclosure on human capital management suggests relations are a high priority.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The board and executive team demonstrate stability. At the Annual Meeting of Stockholders on April 30, 2025, all nine director nominees were re-elected to serve for the ensuing year, indicating shareholder confidence in the current leadership. CEO Peter D. Arvan has been with the company since 2017 and President since 2018, providing consistent leadership. The executive team is a mix of long-tenured officers and newer leaders, suggesting a blend of experience and fresh perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFTqUyFw35FMDpI-cbmb5GPKBDXOvmlsrd_aeEnR0Jvy9_3ksg-C8d0iKaEJDhXx2HKDjPnVphg1ghhruqDqhmDLwpZBNNYkFjl9BV1rrxpVaqsew==], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGubdLQ18Ke75A7OOkUXWeXa1QzepdNefp_L8oQmlp5FDiM-7It53i8ppx5DVcQ-S-41l515VWjtyWka9ErpQCCqvz8VN5s7yNX864p0yin5j1YUzUGSsiYlNjufKLXKGU-dqMqUZ8LS4UcHuxZsrBj0BliF9iiBVysgeQmB7O2K5bYbxVZaG6TwHDUnXPULYiGtSy3vuEY1g== (April 30, 2025)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pool Corp's leadership team extends well beyond the CEO, with ten senior executives listed on its investor relations page. Key functional roles such as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Information Officer, Chief Legal Officer, and Vice Presidents for Supply Chain, Marketing, and Human Resources are all filled by distinct, experienced individuals. The company's "Human Capital Management" policy explicitly mentions succession planning as a key focus, and it runs a formal Manager Trainee (MIT) program to build its pipeline for field leadership. This structure indicates a deep bench of operational and strategic talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFTqUyFw35FMDpI-cbmb5GPKBDXOvmlsrd_aeEnR0Jvy9_3ksg-C8d0iKaEJDhXx2HKDjPnVphg1ghhruqDqhmDLwpZBNNYkFjl9BV1rrxpVaqsew==], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. This provides strong, third-party validation of its accounting controls. The Management's Discussion and Analysis section provides detailed breakdowns of cost drivers and critical accounting estimates for areas like inventory obsolescence and vendor rebates, demonstrating robust internal analysis. There is no history of material weaknesses or financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the fragmented pool supply distribution industry, scale is the most critical competitive advantage, and POOL is the undisputed leader. Its vast network of sales centers provides a logistical advantage that is difficult to replicate, ensuring high product availability and rapid fulfillment for its professional customers, for whom time is critical. The company adds significant value by acting as a purchasing agent and inventory manager for thousands of small contractors, offering them a product breadth and payment terms they could not secure independently. This scale-based service model creates a deep competitive moat.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a long-range outlook through consistent reinvestment in growth initiatives, even during periods of market softness. In its 2025 outlook, despite projecting flat-to-low single-digit sales growth, POOL plans to open 8-10 new sales centers and continue investing in its technology platforms. Management's discussion emphasizes long-term industry drivers like population migration and outdoor living trends over short-term cyclicality. This sustained capital allocation to network and technology expansion underscores a focus on durable, long-term growth over maximizing near-term profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** POOL's financial position is strong, characterized by consistent positive operating cash flow ($659.2 million in 2024). The company funds its operations, capital expenditures, and acquisitions through cash from operations and its credit facilities. Rather than issuing shares, management actively returns capital to shareholders; in May 2024, the Board authorized an increase in its share repurchase program to $600.0 million and has raised its dividend for 20 consecutive quarters. The balance sheet is healthy, indicating no foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGubdLQ18Ke75A7OOkUXWeXa1QzepdNefp_L8oQmlp5FDiM-7It53i8ppx5DVcQ-S-41l515VWjtyWka9ErpQCCqvz8VN5s7yNX864p0yin5j1YUzUGSsiYlNjufKLXKGU-dqMqUZ8LS4UcHuxZsrBj0BliF9iiBVysgeQmB7O2K5bYbxVZaG6TwHDUnXPULYiGtSy3vuEY1g== (April 30, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its communications. In the 2024 Form 10-K, the company plainly stated that "sales of discretionary products for new pool construction and remodeling were softer, impacted by macroeconomic conditions," and clearly explained the resulting 4% decrease in net sales and 190 basis point decline in operating margin. They openly discuss challenges such as moderating inflation benefits and cyclical demand suppression while still providing a clear outlook. This transparency during a period of financial normalization is a strong indicator of candid investor relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags concerning management's integrity. The company has an unqualified "clean" audit opinion on its financial statements and internal controls from its independent auditor. The "Legal Proceedings" disclosure in the 10-K reports no litigation expected to have a material adverse impact. A review of company press releases and SEC filings reveals no material related-party transactions, regulatory actions, or scandals. The board consists of experienced professionals, all of whom were re-elected at the 2025 annual meeting, suggesting shareholder trust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm (February 27, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGubdLQ18Ke75A7OOkUXWeXa1QzepdNefp_L8oQmlp5FDiM-7It53i8ppx5DVcQ-S-41l515VWjtyWka9ErpQCCqvz8VN5s7yNX864p0yin5j1YUzUGSsiYlNjufKLXKGU-dqMqUZ8LS4UcHuxZsrBj0BliF9iiBVysgeQmB7O2K5bYbxVZaG6TwHDUnXPULYiGtSy3vuEY1g== (April 30, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFTqUyFw35FMDpI-cbmb5GPKBDXOvmlsrd_aeEnR0Jvy9_3ksg-C8d0iKaEJDhXx2HKDjPnVphg1ghhruqDqhmDLwpZBNNYkFjl9BV1rrxpVaqsew==]

**Synthesis**

Pool Corp. scores exceptionally well on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its dominant market position, operational excellence, and shareholder-friendly management. The company's strongest positives are its vast, difficult-to-replicate distribution network which provides a significant competitive moat, and the large, non-discretionary nature of its maintenance-related revenue stream. The primary negative, or area for improvement, is its lack of traditional product R&D, though this is inherent to its distributor business model. The most likely variable to change the score in the next 12-24 months is the macroeconomic environment; a recovery in housing turnover and consumer discretionary spending would significantly boost the renovation and new construction segments of the business, likely leading to margin expansion as higher-value products regain momentum. The single "No" for R&D Effectiveness could flip to "Yes" if the company began acquiring or developing more proprietary product lines with unique technology, or if evidence emerged that its POOL360 digital platform was creating significant, measurable market share gains and customer lock-in.

fisher score is 14 / 15
