### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a $500 million share repurchase program in place. As of March 31, 2025, there was $450 million remaining under the program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with the potential for accelerated repurchases depending on market conditions.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $100 million worth of shares over the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $200 million worth of shares over the next 12 months.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases $300 million worth of shares over the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). A significant reduction in share count could lead to a meaningful increase in EPS, which is a key driver of stock valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a history of executing on its share repurchase programs and has ample cash flow to fund it.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price remaining at a level that management deems attractive for repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in the company's 10-Q and 10-K filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive. A downturn in the business could lead the company to preserve cash rather than repurchase shares.

**2. Catalyst Title:** New Club Openings

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company continues to expand its footprint, with 19 new clubs opened in the first quarter of 2025. Franchisees have contractual commitments to open approximately 900 new clubs.

*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Franchisees' ability to secure financing and suitable real estate for new clubs.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** The number of new club openings reported in the company's quarterly earnings releases.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A slowdown in the economy could make it more difficult for franchisees to secure financing. Increased competition for real estate could slow the pace of new club openings.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** International Expansion

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is in the early stages of international expansion, with clubs in Canada, Mexico, Australia, and Spain. This represents a significant long-term growth opportunity.
*   **Mechanism:** Expanding into new international markets significantly increases the company's total addressable market, which can lead to a long runway of revenue and earnings growth.
*   **Timing:** 12-60 months. International expansion is a long-term initiative that will play out over several years.

*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's ability to successfully adapt its business model to new international markets.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** The number of new international club openings and the performance of existing international clubs.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Cultural differences could make it difficult to replicate the company's success in new markets. The company could face strong competition from established local players.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. International expansion is a key long-term catalyst, but it is still too early to tell how successful it will be.

### **6) Timeline / Gantt (Concise)**

| Catalyst | Q3 2025 | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Q2 2026 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Share Repurchase Program** | Ongoing | Ongoing | Ongoing | Ongoing |

| **International Expansion** | 1-2 new clubs | 2-3 new clubs | 3-4 new clubs | 4-5 new clubs |

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (Short)**

**1. Share Repurchase Program**

*   **Assumption:** The company repurchases $200 million of stock at an average price of $110 per share.
*   **Calculation:** $200,000,000 / $110 per share = 1.82 million shares repurchased.
*   **Impact:** A 1.82 million reduction in shares outstanding would increase EPS by approximately 2.2% (based on 84.4 million diluted shares outstanding as of March 31, 2025). This could lead to a 2-3% increase in the stock price, all else being equal.

**2. New Club Openings**

*   **Assumption:** The company opens 150 new clubs over the next 12 months, with each club generating an average of $1.5 million in annual revenue.
*   **Calculation:** 150 new clubs \* $1.5 million in revenue per club = $225 million in additional revenue.
*   **Impact:** A $225 million increase in revenue would represent a 20% increase over 2024 revenue. This could lead to a significant increase in earnings and a corresponding increase in the stock price.
