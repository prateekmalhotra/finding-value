### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com operates in China's e-commerce market, the world's largest, which is still projected for significant growth. The market was valued at approximately $2.22 trillion in 2024 and is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 8.9% to $5.21 trillion by 2034. The Chinese government’s 14th Five-Year Plan further supports this, targeting e-commerce turnover to reach RMB 46 trillion (approximately $6.4 trillion) by 2025. This provides a strong secular tailwind for JD's core retail business, its logistics arm (JDL), and its newer ventures like local on-demand delivery.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com consistently invests in new growth areas, as evidenced by its Q2 2025 results. Management highlighted strategic investments in its food delivery business and international expansion, particularly in Europe and the Middle East. These investments led to a near-term decrease in net profit, indicating a willingness to fund future growth drivers. The company's R&D expenses for the full year 2024 were approximately $2.3 billion, demonstrating a continued financial commitment to innovation.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD's R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue were stable at 1.5% for the full year 2024. This is lower than technology-focused peers like Alibaba, whose R&D spend is a significantly higher portion of revenue. However, JD's R&D is highly focused on its core competency: supply chain and logistics, where it is a recognized leader, having been named to Gartner's Global Supply Chain Top 25. The effectiveness is seen in its operational efficiency and logistics network rather than pure technology products.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For an e-commerce platform, the sales function is measured by user growth and engagement. In Q2 2025, JD reported that its quarterly active customers increased by over 40% year-over-year, a significant acceleration. This growth was attributed to enhanced user experience, competitive pricing, and contributions from new initiatives like the food delivery business. This rapid expansion in its user base points to a highly effective marketing and platform strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD's profit margins are slim, which is characteristic of the first-party retail model. In Q2 2025, the consolidated non-GAAP net margin was 2.1%, pressured by investments in new businesses. However, the core JD Retail segment remains healthy, with its non-GAAP operating margin improving to 4.5% from 3.9% in the prior year. While the consolidated margin is not high, the profitability of the core business is solid and improving.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving the profitability of its core business. The company reported its 13th consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion in Q2 2025. This was driven by better sourcing, operational efficiencies in its supply chain, and an improving product mix. While overall margins are diluted by new investments, the actions taken within the core JD Retail segment are clearly yielding positive results and demonstrate a clear focus on long-term margin health.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com positions itself as a responsible employer, highlighting its large workforce of approximately 570,000 as of year-end 2024. The company has made public commitments to its employees, including a February 2025 announcement that it would increase salaries for over 20,000 customer service employees by an average of 30%. It also provides comprehensive benefits, housing funds, and career development programs. While it is difficult to verify relations perfectly, the absence of major public labor disputes and the presence of proactive wage increases are positive indicators.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability. Ms. Sandy Xu has served as CEO since May 2023 and was previously CFO from June 2020, indicating a smooth internal succession. Founder Richard Liu remains Chairman, providing long-term strategic oversight. The senior management team listed on the company's investor relations site includes leaders who have been with the company for several years, suggesting a cohesive and stable executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com has a deep bench of leadership across its various business segments. The company's structure includes dedicated CEOs for JD Retail (Sandy Xu, concurrently), JD Logistics (Jiajia Hu), and Dada (Jun Yang), among other key executives for technology and finance. This decentralized leadership structure empowers segment-specific expertise and mitigates key-person risk at the consolidated level. The promotion of the former CFO to CEO also suggests a focus on developing and promoting internal talent.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com's annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2024, contains an unqualified audit opinion from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, a Big Four accounting firm. The company provides detailed segment reporting for JD Retail, JD Logistics, and New Businesses, offering transparency into its cost structure. There is no recent history of material weaknesses in internal controls or significant accounting restatements.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com's most significant competitive advantage is its proprietary, nationwide logistics network. Unlike competitors such as Alibaba which primarily use third-party logistics, JD's control over its own supply chain (from warehousing to last-mile delivery) allows for superior service levels, quality control, and faster delivery times. This "supply chain-based technology and service provider" model is a key differentiator in the Chinese e-commerce market and a high barrier to entry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in the Q2 2025 earnings call clearly demonstrates a long-range profit outlook. They explicitly stated that the 49% year-on-year decline in non-GAAP net income was a direct result of "strategic investment in food delivery" and other new businesses. This willingness to sacrifice significant near-term profitability to build out new, potentially large revenue streams is a hallmark of a long-term strategic focus.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com's financial position is exceptionally strong. As of the end of Q2 2025, the company held RMB 223 billion in cash and short-term investments. Furthermore, the company is actively returning capital to shareholders, not seeking it. The board approved a new $5.0 billion share repurchase program in August 2024, and the company bought back $1.5 billion in stock between January 1, 2025, and May 13, 2025. This indicates more than sufficient capital to fund growth internally.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrated candor in its Q2 2025 earnings report. Despite robust top-line growth, they openly addressed the significant drop in net income and free cash flow. The CFO was direct in attributing these declines to specific strategic investments in new businesses and cash outflows from trading programs. This level of transparency, explaining both the positive and negative results, shows a commitment to clear communication with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While JD.com itself has maintained a relatively clean record, its operating environment presents risks. In August 2025, its third-party payment unit, Chinabank Payments, was fined $1.3 million for compliance failures related to merchant verification. This, while not at the parent company level, indicates governance lapses within a subsidiary. On a positive note, JD.com notably won a major antitrust lawsuit against rival Alibaba in early 2024 for monopolistic practices, positioning itself as a defender of fair competition. Given the subsidiary's fine, integrity cannot be deemed "unquestionable."
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**
JD.com scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strength in its market opportunity, long-term vision, management depth, and financial fortitude. The company's core advantages are its massive, growing addressable market and its unparalleled logistics infrastructure, which creates a durable competitive moat. The primary weaknesses identified are twofold: R&D spending, which is low relative to peers and could risk ceding ground on future technological innovation, and a minor regulatory infraction at a subsidiary that blemishes an otherwise strong integrity record. The most significant variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the performance of the new businesses, particularly food delivery. If these strategic investments begin to show a clear path to profitability and market leadership, it would strongly reaffirm the management's long-range outlook (Point 12) and likely improve overall margins (Point 5). A reversal of the "No" on R&D effectiveness would require either a significant increase in spend or more tangible, market-leading innovations beyond its core logistics.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
