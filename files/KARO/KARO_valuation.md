### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Guidance is sourced from the press release on Q4 and FY2025 results, filed on May 14, 2025.

*   **Revenue Growth:** "Cartrack's subscription revenue between ZAR4,700 million and ZAR4,900 million, which implies Cartrack subscription revenue growth between 16% and 21% compared to FY 2025."
*   **Margin Target:** "Cartrack's operating profit margin between 26% and 31%."
*   **Profitability Outlook:** "As we expand our distribution footprint in existing markets, we expect lower Earnings Per Share growth in FY 2026 given our planned upfront investment in sales and marketing for the year."

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Forecast (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Year 1 Growth:** 18.5%. This is the midpoint of management's guidance for its main segment (Cartrack), applied to the consolidated revenue.
    *   **Years 2-5 Growth:** The growth rate will decline by 2% per year, from 16.5% in Year 2 to 10.5% in Year 5, reflecting a gradual maturation from the high-growth phase.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin):** 28.5%. This is the midpoint of management's guided range for Cartrack (26%-31%) and aligns with the TTM margin of 28.7%. This is held constant, consistent with management's commentary about reinvestment.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 25%. This is a normalization of the last three fiscal years' rates (FY2025: 24.85%, FY2024: 29.23%, FY2023: 31.91%), accounting for the most recent trend.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex as % of Revenue:** 21.5%. This is the TTM Capex (1,022M) as a percentage of TTM Revenue (4,763M). This ratio is held constant.
    *   **Change in Working Capital as % of Incremental Revenue:** 5.0%. This is based on a historical average, assuming modest investment is needed to support growth.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** Treated as a ZAR 0 cost, as it is not explicitly disclosed in the browsed financial summaries. This is a limitation of the analysis.
    *   **Diluted Share Count:** 30.89 million shares, held constant.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - SBC

| (ZAR, millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 5,644 | 6,575 | 7,594 | 8,620 | 9,525 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *18.5%* | *16.5%* | *15.5%* | *13.5%* | *10.5%* |
| EBIT (28.5% Margin) | 1,608 | 1,874 | 2,164 | 2,457 | 2,715 |
| Tax (25%) | -402 | -469 | -541 | -614 | -679 |
| **NOPAT** | **1,206** | **1,406** | **1,623** | **1,842** | **2,036** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (Current 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield). (YCharts, August 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5% (Standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.07 (5-Year Beta). This reflects slightly higher volatility than the market average, suitable for a high-growth tech company in emerging markets. (StockAnalysis)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 1.07 * 5.5% = 10.19%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt:** 10.9% (TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = 60M / 556M).
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 10.9% * (1 - 25%) = 8.18%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Cap (Equity): ZAR 26.26 Billion (JSE listing reference).
    *   Market Value of Debt: ZAR 556 Million.
    *   **WACC = (E/(E+D)) * CoE + (D/(E+D)) * CoD * (1-T)**
    *   **WACC = (26,260 / 26,816) * 10.19% + (556 / 26,816) * 8.18% = 10.14%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This represents a reasonable long-term growth rate, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   **Terminal Value = (1,202 * 1.025) / (10.14% - 2.5%) = ZAR 16,108 Million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   A median historical multiple is not readily available in the browsed sources. A conservative 10x EV/EBITDA multiple is assumed for a mature SaaS company.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = 2,715 + 1,259 = ZAR 3,974 Million.
    *   Implied Terminal Value = 10 * 3,974 = ZAR 39,740 Million.
    *   The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative value and will be used.

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Equity Value / Diluted Shares = 14,004M / 30.89M = ZAR 453.38 per share.**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **ZAR 453.38**. This assumes the company meets growth and margin guidance and transitions smoothly to mature growth.
    *   **Low/Bear Case (ZAR 320):** Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 12-15% initial) and margin compression to 25% due to competition and reinvestment needs. Terminal growth at 2.0%.
    *   **High/Bull Case (ZAR 590):** Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 20-22% initial) from successful market expansion and modest margin expansion to 30% over the forecast period.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a margin of safety.
    *   **MOS Price = 453.38 * (1 - 0.30) = ZAR 317.37**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation is sensitive to management's ability to execute on its growth strategy, particularly in expanding its sales and marketing footprint without significantly damaging profitability.
2.  **Emerging Market Exposure:** A significant portion of Karooooo's business is in South Africa and other emerging markets, exposing it to currency fluctuations and geopolitical instability.
3.  **Competition:** The vehicle telematics and fleet management industry is competitive. Increased competition could pressure prices and margins, impacting long-term profitability.
4.  **SBC Uncertainty:** The lack of clear disclosure on stock-based compensation means a potential non-cash expense is excluded from the free cash flow calculation, which could overstate the final valuation.

final answer is 453.38 ZAR $
