**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current market price, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used to solve for the key assumptions the market is implying. The goal is to find the 5-year Free Cash Flow (FCF) growth rate that results in the current Enterprise Value.

*   **Enterprise Value (EV)** = Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash
    *   Market Cap = $45.13 * 15.53M shares = $700.7M
    *   EV = $700.7M + $539.81M - $1.40M = **$1,239.11M**

*   **Baseline Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)**
    *   Formula: FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in WC
    *   TTM Tax Rate: 27.25% (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   FCFF (TTM) = $94.76M * (1 - 0.2725) + $22.95M - $7.69M - $15.01M - (-$34.46M) = **$103.67M**

*   **Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.33% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Beta: 0.83 (Zacks, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (Standard assumption for a mature market)
    *   Cost of Equity = 4.33% + 0.83 * 5.0% = 8.48%
    *   Cost of Debt = $29.37M / $539.81M = 5.44%
    *   WACC = (E/(E+D)) * CoE + (D/(E+D)) * CoD * (1-t)
    *   WACC = ($700.7M/$1240.51M) * 8.48% + ($539.81M/$1240.51M) * 5.44% * (1-0.2725) = **6.50%**

*   **Market-Implied Growth Rate**
    Using the inputs above and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, an iterative DCF calculation shows that the market is pricing in a **5-year average annual growth rate in Free Cash Flow of approximately 9.3%.** Assuming margins and capital intensity remain constant, this implies a similar long-term revenue growth expectation.

To justify today's stock price of $45.13, one must believe Carriage Services can grow its free cash flow by an average of **9.3% per year for the next five years**, before settling into a 2.5% terminal growth rate.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on an independent and conservative assessment of the company's prospects.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Revenue Growth:** The market's implied 9.3% growth is aggressive compared to the TTM YoY growth of 3.15% (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025). Management commentary from the Q2 2025 earnings call suggests a focus on "strategic acquisitions" and "stable growth" (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025). A more conservative approach is warranted. I will model revenue growth starting at **5.0%** in Year 1, tapering down to **3.0%** by Year 5, reflecting modest growth from acquisitions and price increases.
7.  **Operating Margin:** The TTM EBIT margin is 23.25%. Management has not provided specific guidance on margin expansion. Therefore, I will assume the **EBIT margin remains stable at 23.0%** throughout the forecast period, slightly below the TTM level to be conservative.
8.  **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate was 27.25%. I will use a slightly more conservative **effective tax rate of 28.0%** for the forecast period.
9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   Capex: TTM Capex was 3.7% of revenue ($15.0M / $407.6M). I will assume **Capex remains at 3.7% of revenue.**
    *   Working Capital: TTM Change in WC was negative, indicating a source of cash. This is unlikely to continue indefinitely. I will conservatively model **Change in Working Capital as 2.0% of the change in revenue**, a more neutral assumption.
10. **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-Based Comp (SBC): Will be treated as a cash expense. TTM SBC was 1.9% of revenue. I will model **SBC at 1.9% of revenue.**
    *   Share Count: The latest diluted share count of **15.53 million** will be used. (CSV 10-Q, Aug 7, 2025, p. 26)

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

11. FCFF is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure. The formula is: **FCFF = EBIT * (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**.
12. Based on the conservative assumptions, the 5-year FCFF forecast is as follows (in USD Millions):

| Metric | YR 1 | YR 2 | YR 3 | YR 4 | YR 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 5.0% | 4.5% | 4.0% | 3.5% | 3.0% |
| Revenue | $427.98 | $447.24 | $465.13 | $481.41 | $495.85 |
| EBIT (23.0% of Rev) | $98.44 | $102.87 | $107.00 | $110.72 | $114.05 |
| EBIT * (1-t) | $70.87 | $74.06 | $77.04 | $79.72 | $82.11 |
| + D&A (5.6% of Rev) | $23.97 | $25.05 | $26.05 | $26.96 | $27.77 |
| - Capex (3.7% of Rev) | ($15.84) | ($16.55) | ($17.21) | ($17.81) | ($18.35) |
| - SBC (1.9% of Rev) | ($8.13) | ($8.50) | ($8.84) | ($9.15) | ($9.42) |
| - Chg in WC | ($0.41) | ($0.39) | ($0.36) | ($0.33) | ($0.29) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)**| **$70.47** | **$73.72** | **$76.68** | **$79.39** | **$81.82** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

13. The WACC calculation from Part 1 is appropriate and will be used here.
    *   **WACC = 6.50%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

14. **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term sustainable economic growth and inflation.
    *   Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Value = ($81.82M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0650 - 0.025) = **$2,096.58M**
15. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $114.05M + $27.77M = $141.82M
    *   A conservative 10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple for the sector is around 10x.
    *   Terminal Value (Multiple) = $141.82M * 10.0 = **$1,418.2M**
    *   The Gordon Growth value is higher, and per instructions, it will be used.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

16. **Enterprise Value** = PV of explicit period FCFF + PV of terminal value.
    *   PV of FCFF (Y1-5) = $66.17 + $65.03 + $63.38 + $61.71 + $59.77 = **$316.06M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $2,096.58M / (1.0650)^5 = **$1,531.39M**
    *   Enterprise Value = $316.06M + $1,531.39M = **$1,847.45M**
17. **Equity Value** = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $539.81M - $1.40M = $538.41M
    *   Equity Value = $1,847.45M - $538.41M = **$1,309.04M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

18. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value** = Equity Value / Diluted Shares
    *   Fair Value = $1,309.04M / 15.53M shares = **$84.29 per share**
19. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $84.29**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $65.00.** This assumes lower revenue growth (2-4%) and slight margin compression to 22%, resulting in a lower valuation.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $105.00.** This assumes more successful acquisitions, leading to higher revenue growth (6-8%) and margin expansion to 24%.
20. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for estimation errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   MOS Price = $84.29 * (1 - 0.30) = **$59.00**

**Risk Notes**
1.  **Acquisition Risk:** The company's growth strategy relies on successfully identifying and integrating acquisitions. Overpaying or failing to integrate acquisitions could destroy shareholder value.
2.  **Interest Rate Risk:** A significant portion of the company's debt is subject to variable rates. A sustained high-interest-rate environment would increase interest expense and reduce free cash flow.
3.  **Changing Consumer Preferences:** A continued shift towards lower-cost cremation services over traditional burials could pressure revenue growth and margins if not managed effectively through pricing and service offerings.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** The funeral service industry is subject to state and federal regulations. Changes in these regulations, particularly concerning preneed sales and trusts, could adversely affect operations.

final answer is 84.29 $
