*   **Market Price:** $51.00 (Market close, August 22, 2025).

**2) Baseline Financials (TTM)**
The following table presents Karooooo's Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) financials, ended May 31, 2025. Financials are converted from the reporting currency, South African Rand (ZAR), to USD at a rate of 0.0573 USD per ZAR. (ZAR to USD Exchange Rate, August 24, 2025).

| Metric | TTM Value (ZAR, millions) | TTM Value (USD, millions) | Source & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **EBIT Margin** | **28.6%** | **28.6%** | *(Calculated as EBIT/Revenue)* |
| Net Income | 964 | $55.2 | (StockAnalysis, Income Statement, August 24, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | 633 | $36.3 | (StockAnalysis, Cash Flow Statement, August 24, 2025) |

| Capital Expenditures | -1,022 | -$58.6 | (StockAnalysis, Cash Flow Statement, August 24, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | -58 | -$3.3 | (StockAnalysis, Cash Flow Statement, August 24, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | -60 | -$3.4 | (StockAnalysis, Income Statement, August 24, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | 1,103 | $63.2 | (StockAnalysis, Balance Sheet, August 24, 2025) |
| Total Debt | 556 | $31.8 | (StockAnalysis, Balance Sheet, August 24, 2025) |
| Diluted W.A. Shares | 30.89 | 30.89 | (StockAnalysis, Balance Sheet, August 24, 2025) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market-implied growth rate, we first calculate the firm's Enterprise Value and estimate a preliminary WACC.
*   **Market Capitalization:** $51.00/share * 30.89M shares = $1,575.4M
*   **Net Debt:** $31.8M (Total Debt) - $63.2M (Cash) = -$31.4M (Net Cash)
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $1,575.4M - $31.4M = $1,544.0M

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
To justify the current enterprise value of $1,544.0M (an EV/EBIT multiple of 19.7x), an investor must believe Karooooo can achieve a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 17-18%** while largely maintaining its high TTM **EBIT margin of 28.6%**. This combination of sustained high growth and high profitability is the core belief currently priced into the stock.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Balanced Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on balanced assumptions grounded in historical performance and a realistic outlook for maturation.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6) Critical Review:**
The market's implied growth rate is optimistic. While Karooooo has a strong track record (3-year revenue CAGR of 18.8%), assuming this rate continues unabated for five more years is aggressive. A more balanced forecast incorporates a gradual deceleration as the company scales and faces tougher competition.

**7) Revenue for Years 1â€“5:**
*   **Assumption:** Revenue will grow at **15%** in Year 1, tapering down by 2% each year to **7%** in Year 5.
*   **Justification:** This path acknowledges the company's strong momentum but builds in conservatism by modeling a deceleration due to the law of large numbers and increasing market penetration. It represents a more probable trajectory than a sustained high-growth scenario.

**8) Margin Path:**
*   **Assumption:** EBIT margin will be **27.0%** for the forecast period.
*   **Justification:** The TTM margin is 28.6%, while the 3-year average is 26.2%. Choosing a 27.0% margin strikes a balance. It acknowledges recent strong performance but is more conservative than the TTM figure, providing a buffer against potential competitive pressures or operational fluctuations.

**9) Taxes:**
*   **Assumption:** An effective tax rate of **26.0%**.
*   **Justification:** This is the average effective tax rate over the last three full fiscal years (FY2023-2025), providing a normalized and stable forecast rate.

**10) Reinvestment & Capital Intensity:**
*   **D&A:** **13.3% of Revenue**. Based on the consistent TTM ratio (36.3M / 272.9M).
*   **Capex:** **21.5% of Revenue**. Based on the consistent TTM ratio (58.6M / 272.9M).
*   **Working Capital:** **1.5% of incremental revenue**. This is based on the historical relationship between changes in working capital and revenue growth.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   **SBC:** Treated as a real cash expense. Forecasted at **3.2% of revenue**, consistent with the TTM level.
*   **Share Count:** The diluted share count of **30.89 million** is assumed to remain constant as a neutral base-case assumption.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated to represent cash available to all capital providers before debt payments.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $313.8 | $354.6 | $393.7 | $429.1 | $459.1 |
| *Growth Rate* | *15.0%* | *13.0%* | *11.0%* | *9.0%* | *7.0%* |
| EBIT | $84.7 | $95.8 | $106.3 | $115.9 | $124.0 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *27.0%* | *27.0%* | *27.0%* | *27.0%* | *27.0%* |
| NOPAT | $62.7 | $70.9 | $78.7 | $85.7 | $91.7 |
| D&A | $41.7 | $47.2 | $52.4 | $57.1 | $61.1 |
| Stock-Based Comp | -$10.0 | -$11.3 | -$12.6 | -$13.7 | -$14.7 |
| Capex | -$67.5 | -$76.2 | -$84.6 | -$92.3 | -$98.7 |
| Change in WC | -$0.6 | -$0.6 | -$0.6 | -$0.5 | -$0.5 |
| **FCFF** | **$26.3** | **$29.9** | **$33.2** | **$36.2** | **$38.9** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.26%** (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.5%**. A standard premium for a global company listed on a U.S. exchange.
*   **Beta:** **1.07**. (StockAnalysis, August 24, 2025).
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.07 * 5.5% = 10.15%**

**15) Cost of Debt:**
*   **Cost of Debt (pre-tax):** 5.8% (Interest Expense / Average Debt).
*   **Cost of Debt (after-tax) = 5.8% * (1 - 26.0%) = 4.29%**

**16) WACC:**
*   **Market Value of Equity:** $1,575.4M (98.0%)
*   **Market Value of Debt:** $31.8M (2.0%)
*   **WACC = (0.98 * 10.15%) + (0.02 * 4.29%) = 10.03%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Gordon Growth Method (Sanity Check):**
A Gordon Growth model is problematic here because the forecast assumptions (Capex at 21.5% of revenue, D&A at 13.3%) create a high reinvestment rate. This implies a terminal Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) of ~4%, which is far below the WACC of 10.03%. Using this method would incorrectly assume the company destroys value in perpetuity, producing an unrealistically low terminal value. Therefore, an Exit Multiple approach is more appropriate.

**18) Exit Multiple Method:**
*   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT ($124.0M) + D&A ($61.1M) = **$185.1M**
*   **Selected Exit Multiple:** **9.0x EV/EBITDA**.
*   **Justification:** This multiple is balanced and realistic. While elite, mature SaaS companies can trade at 12x+, a 9.0x multiple appropriately accounts for Karooooo's lower 2.5% terminal growth rate and its significant exposure to emerging market risks (currency fluctuations, economic and political instability). It is more reasonable than an overly punitive low multiple or an overly optimistic high one.
*   **Terminal Value = $185.1M * 9.0 = $1,665.9M**

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value:**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($26.3/1.1003^1) + ($29.9/1.1003^2) + ($33.2/1.1003^3) + ($36.2/1.1003^4) + ($38.9/1.1003^5) = $121.7M
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $1,665.9M / (1.1003^5) = $1,032.7M
*   **Total Enterprise Value = $121.7M + $1,032.7M = $1,154.4M**

**20) Equity Value:**
*   **Equity Value = $1,154.4M (Enterprise Value) + $31.4M (Net Cash) = $1,185.8M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   **Fair Value Per Share = $1,185.8M / 30.89M shares = $38.39**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $38.39**. (As calculated with a 9.0x exit multiple).
*   **Low/Bear Case: $28.50**. (Assumes 12% tapering to 4% revenue growth, 25% EBIT margins, and a 7.5x exit multiple).
*   **High/Bull Case: $49.75**. (Assumes 18% tapering to 8% revenue growth, 28% EBIT margins, and a 10.5x exit multiple).

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 30% margin of safety from the base-case estimate is applied to establish a conservative entry point.
*   **MOS Price = $38.39 * (1 - 0.30) = $26.87**

**Risk Notes:**
1.  **Currency Fluctuation:** As a company reporting in ZAR with significant global operations, fluctuations in the ZAR/USD and other exchange rates can materially impact reported earnings and cash flows.
2.  **Competition:** The vehicle telematics and fleet management industry is highly competitive. Increased competition could pressure prices and subscriber growth, impacting revenue and margins.
3.  **Emerging Market Exposure:** Significant operations in South Africa and Southeast Asia expose the company to political, economic, and regulatory risks inherent in emerging markets.
4.  **Technological Disruption:** The SaaS and mobility sectors are subject to rapid technological change. A failure to innovate or adapt to new technologies could erode Karooooo's competitive position.

final answer is 38.39 $
