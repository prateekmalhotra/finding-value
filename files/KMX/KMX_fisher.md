CarMax, Inc., August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 28, 2025, and earnings call transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax is the largest retailer of used vehicles in a highly fragmented U.S. market. In calendar year 2024, the company estimated it sold approximately 3.7% of the 0- to 10-year-old vehicles sold nationwide, indicating a substantial opportunity for market share growth. The total addressable market is large, with approximately 38 million used cars sold in the U.S. in calendar 2024. CarMax's established omni-channel platform, combining online and in-store experiences, positions it to capture a larger share of this market over time.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on enhancing its omni-channel platform, leveraging data science, and improving customer and associate experiences. In fiscal 2025, CarMax rolled out new systems for order processing, AI-driven tools for its Customer Experience Centers, and EV research tools. The company is also expanding its finance arm (CAF) to serve customers across the full credit spectrum and enhancing its digital appraisal products like MaxOffer to improve its vehicle sourcing. Strategic initiatives for fiscal 2026 include improving the online vehicle transfer experience and expanding the functionality of its AI assistant, Skye.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a retailer, CarMax does not have traditional R&D expenses but invests heavily in technology and innovation. As of February 28, 2025, the company employed 1,481 associates in technology, product, and data science roles. The output of these efforts is seen in the continued enhancement of its omni-channel platform, with approximately 80% of customers leveraging digital capabilities during their transactions in fiscal 2025. The company's AI-powered virtual assistant, Skye, now independently answers over half of customer questions, showing a significant year-over-year improvement in efficiency. However, the company does not disclose specific R&D or technology spending figures, making direct comparison to peers difficult.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax’s sales model is a key differentiator, built on a no-haggle pricing strategy that removes a common customer pain point. Sales consultants are paid a fixed commission per unit, regardless of the vehicle's price, which aligns their interests with the customer's. This customer-centric approach is supported by an omni-channel platform that allows customers to transact online, in-store, or through a combination. In fiscal 2025, this model supported the retail sale of 789,050 used vehicles. The company’s brand is built on this transparent process, which is a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2025, CarMax reported a gross profit margin of 11.0% and a net earnings margin of 1.9%. Used vehicle gross profit per unit was $2,311, and wholesale vehicle gross profit per unit was $1,024. While these margins are influenced by the highly competitive and capital-intensive nature of used car retail, the company has consistently generated profits. However, compared to less capital-intensive retail sectors, these margins are relatively thin.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing cost efficiencies in its operations. CarMax is focused on driving down the cost of sales through identified opportunities in its logistics network and reconditioning operations, achieving savings of approximately $125 per unit in fiscal 2025 with a similar target for fiscal 2026. The company is also focused on leveraging its SG&A expenses, with a goal of achieving an SG&A-to-gross-profit ratio in the mid-70% range over time. Additionally, the expansion of its higher-margin CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) business across the credit spectrum is a key initiative to capture additional profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax has been recognized for 21 consecutive years as one of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work For," which reflects a strong positive culture. The company states that as of February 28, 2025, none of its 30,048 associates were subject to a collective bargaining agreement. It conducts annual pay equity reviews and biannual associate engagement surveys to solicit feedback and maintain a positive work environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at CarMax exhibits stability and experience. CEO William D. Nash has been with the company since 1997 and has served as CEO since 2016. Many of the executive vice presidents and senior vice presidents have long tenures with the company, having been promoted internally through various roles, indicating a stable and cohesive leadership team with a deep understanding of the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax has a deep bench of management talent beyond the CEO. The company lists nine executive officers in its 10-K filing, with detailed biographies showcasing extensive experience within CarMax and the broader industry. Leaders are in place for key functions such as CarMax Auto Finance (Jon G. Daniels), Operations (C. Joseph Wilson), and Technology (Shamim Mohammad), demonstrating a distributed leadership structure rather than reliance on a single individual. The consistent pattern of internal promotion to executive roles suggests a focus on developing leadership from within.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's financial statements are audited by KPMG LLP, which provided an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of February 28, 2025. The 10-K indicates no material weaknesses were identified. The company provides detailed segment reporting for its Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance businesses, offering granular data on performance drivers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's most significant competitive advantage is its integrated, omni-channel business model combined with its scale. The ability to source a large portion of its inventory directly from consumers via its well-known appraisal process provides a structural cost advantage over competitors who rely more heavily on wholesale auctions. Furthermore, its in-house finance arm, CAF, allows it to capture a larger share of the value chain and provides a valuable source of data to optimize underwriting. This combination of scale in sourcing, sales, and financing is difficult for smaller competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. The company has made significant and sustained investments in building its omni-channel platform and technology, which has impacted short-term SG&A expenses. Management's commentary in the FY2025 10-K discusses long-term goals of gaining market share and achieving double-digit EPS growth over time, even while removing specific timeframes due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The company's capital allocation strategy prioritizes investing in digital capabilities and strategic expansion of its footprint, indicating a focus on long-term durable growth over short-term profit maximization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax has historically funded its operations and growth through cash from operations and debt, not through dilutive equity financing. The company has a significant share repurchase program, having bought back $428.5 million of its common stock in fiscal 2025. As of February 28, 2025, the company had $1.94 billion remaining under its board authorization for repurchases. This consistent buying back of shares, rather than issuing new ones, demonstrates financial strength and a commitment to preventing shareholder dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management’s discussion and analysis in the 10-K and commentary in earnings call transcripts address business challenges directly. For example, the 10-K acknowledges that its market share came under pressure during the first half of the year before recovering. In the Q4 2025 earnings call, executives discussed challenges like vehicle affordability and detailed the specific actions they were taking to address cost structures and improve efficiency. This level of transparency in discussing both headwinds and strategic responses suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)], [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KMX/transcripts/ (Date of latest transcript: April 10, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax was founded on the "fundamental principle of integrity," which it states is critical to its success. The company’s Code of Business Conduct is available on its website. A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section of the FY2025 10-K and public news sources do not reveal any material lawsuits or regulatory actions that would call into question the integrity of senior management. The auditor's report from KPMG is clean, with no material issues cited.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1170010/000117001025000024/kmx-20250228.htm (Filed: April 11, 2025)]

**Synthesis**
CarMax scores well on Fisher's qualitative measures, demonstrating a strong, long-tenured management team, a positive corporate culture, and a business model with a significant competitive moat built on scale and operational integration. The primary negatives are related to the financial metrics of the business itself: relatively low net profit margins inherent to the capital-intensive auto retail industry, and the lack of specific R&D spending disclosures which makes effectiveness difficult to measure quantitatively. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: margin improvement and market share gains. Evidence of sustained margin expansion from the company's cost-saving initiatives and growth in its CAF business would flip the "No" on point 5 to a "Yes". Similarly, a measurable and sustained increase in its 3.7% market share of 0-10 year old used cars would provide further concrete evidence for its long-term growth runway.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
