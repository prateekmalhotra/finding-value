### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Year 1:** A -2.0% decline is projected, reflecting continued global economic uncertainty and the planned reduction in Amazon volume.
    *   **Years 2-5:** A modest 2.5% annual growth rate is assumed, slightly below long-term inflation expectations, reflecting a mature market and ongoing competitive pressures.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin of 9.4% (8,521 / 90,910) is used as the baseline and held constant, as management has not provided specific margin targets and the impact of cost savings initiatives is balanced against potential revenue pressures.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 23.5%, based on management's guidance for 2025. (UPS Releases 2Q 2025 Earnings, July 29, 2025)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** $3.5 billion annually for the forecast period, in line with management's 2025 guidance.
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeled at 1.0% of incremental revenue, based on historical averages.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** Held constant at the TTM level of $72 million.
    *   **Share Count:** 850 million diluted weighted-average shares, as reported in the Q1 2025 10-Q.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | NOPAT | D&A | SBC | Capex | Change in WC | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $89,092 | $8,375 | $6,407 | $3,623 | $72 | $3,500 | ($18) | $6,476 |
| 2 | $91,319 | $8,584 | $6,567 | $3,623 | $72 | $3,500 | $22 | $6,596 |
| 3 | $93,602 | $8,799 | $6,731 | $3,623 | $72 | $3,500 | $23 | $6,759 |
| 4 | $95,942 | $9,019 | $6,900 | $3,623 | $72 | $3,500 | $23 | $6,928 |
| 5 | $98,341 | $9,244 | $7,072 | $3,623 | $72 | $3,500 | $24 | $7,099 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.28% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0%, a standard market premium.
    *   **Beta:** 1.10 (5-Year Monthly Beta), reflecting market volatility similar to the broader market.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.28% + 1.10 * 5.0% = 9.78%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Interest Expense / Average Debt:** $893 / (($21,284 + $21,369)/2) = 4.18%
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.18% * (1 - 23.5%) = 3.20%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity:** 850 million shares * $87.80/share = $74,630 million
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $21,369 million
    *   **WACC = (74,630 / (74,630 + 21,369)) * 9.78% + (21,369 / (74,630 + 21,369)) * 3.20% = 8.24%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($7,099 * 1.025) / (8.24% - 2.5%) = $126,838 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $9,244 + $3,623 = $12,867 million**
    *   **Implied Exit Multiple = Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA = $126,838 / $12,867 = 9.86x** (This is in line with the sector's historical median multiple.)

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Explicit Period FCFF** | $29,606 |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | $85,249 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$114,855** |
| Less: Total Debt | ($21,369) |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents | $4,802 |
| **Equity Value** | **$98,288** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $98,288 / 850 = $115.63 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$115.63**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** With a 1.5% terminal growth rate and a 9.0% WACC, the value would be approximately **$95 per share.**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** With a 3.0% revenue growth rate in years 2-5 and a 3.0% terminal growth rate, the value would be approximately **$140 per share.**
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **30% below Base-Case Fair Value = $115.63 * (1 - 0.30) = $80.94**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** A global economic slowdown could further pressure package volumes and revenue.
2.  **Competitive Intensity:** Increased competition from traditional carriers and new entrants could erode market share and pricing power.
3.  **Execution Risk:** The company's ability to successfully execute on its cost-saving and network reconfiguration initiatives is critical to achieving its financial targets.
4.  **Amazon Volume Reduction:** The planned reduction in volume from Amazon, while strategic, carries the risk of not being fully offset by higher-yielding business.
5.  **Labor Relations:** As a heavily unionized company, any future labor disputes could lead to service disruptions and increased costs.
