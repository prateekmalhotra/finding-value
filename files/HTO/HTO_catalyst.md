### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Acquisition of Quadvest**

*   **Assumption:** The acquisition adds 5% to HTO's revenue.
*   **Formula:** Estimated Price = Current Price \* (1 + % Revenue Increase)
*   **Calculation:** Assuming the current price is $60, the estimated price would be $60 \* (1 + 0.05) = $63. This represents a 5% increase.

**2. Strong Earnings Growth**

*   **Assumption:** HTO achieves the high end of its 2025 adjusted EPS guidance of $3.00.
*   **Formula:** Estimated Price = Adjusted EPS \* P/E Multiple
*   **Calculation:** Assuming a P/E multiple of 25 (in line with the industry average), the estimated price would be $3.00 \* 25 = $75. This represents a 25% increase from a hypothetical current price of $60.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for H2O America is positive. The recent acquisition of Quadvest, coupled with strong earnings growth, should provide a significant boost to the stock in the next 0-12 months. The reaffirmed guidance for 2025 adds to the positive outlook. The only noteworthy anti-catalyst is the recent insider selling, which could indicate that some executives believe the stock is fully valued.
