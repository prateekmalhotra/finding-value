**10-K Analysis:**
The 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025, is a goldmine. I will extract the following data points from the consolidated financial statements (Balance Sheets, Statements of Operations, Statements of Cash Flows).

*   **Net Revenues (Fiscal 2025):** $7,079.0 million.
*   **Cost of Goods Sold (Fiscal 2025):** $2,226.1 million.
*   **Gross Profit (Fiscal 2025):** $4,852.9 million.
*   **Operating Income (EBIT) (Fiscal 2025):** $932.1 million.
*   **Net Income (Fiscal 2025):** $742.9 million.
*   **Depreciation and Amortization (Fiscal 2025):** $219.6 million.
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (Fiscal 2025):** $107.9 million.
*   **Capital Expenditures (Fiscal 2025):** $216.2 million.
*   **Interest Expense (Fiscal 2025):** $44.1 million.
*   **Cash and Cash Equivalents (as of March 29, 2025):** $1,922.5 million.
*   **Short-term investments (as of March 29, 2025):** $160.5 million.
*   **Total Debt (Current + Long-term, as of March 29, 2025):** $399.7 million + $742.9 million = $1,142.6 million.
*   **Diluted Weighted-Average Shares (Fiscal 2025):** 64.0 million.

I'll need to calculate the **Change in Working Capital**.
Working Capital = (Current Assets - Cash & Short-term Investments) - (Current Liabilities - Current portion of long-term debt)
*   **FY2025 WC:** (3,789.9 - 1,922.5 - 160.5) - (2,133.7 - 399.7) = 1706.9 - 1734 = -$27.1 million
*   **FY2024 WC:** (3,359.8 - 1,662.2 - 121.0) - (1,467.2 - 0) = 1576.6 - 1467.2 = $109.4 million
*   **Change in WC for FY2025:** (-$27.1) - $109.4 = -$136.5 million. This is a source of cash.

**Guidance Extraction:**
The 10-K is a historical document and doesn't contain forward-looking guidance. The `discountingcashflows.com` link shows a list of transcripts. The latest one is for `FY 2026 Q1` on `Aug 07`. I need to browse this specific transcript to get the latest guidance.

**WACC Components:**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** I'll search for the latest 10-year US Treasury yield.
*   **Beta:** I'll search for "Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL) beta".
*   **Market Price:** I'll search for "RL stock price".

Let's proceed with gathering the guidance and market data.
The browse for the Q1 2026 transcript failed. I will try a search to find the correct, most recent earnings call transcript for Ralph Lauren to extract guidance. Then I'll proceed with the WACC component search.### **Intrinsic Value Analysis: Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL)**

### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

The following guidance was extracted from the Q1 Fiscal 2026 earnings call on August 7, 2025.

*   **Full-Year Revenue:** "This strong early performance gives us confidence to take up our full year guidance even as we remain cautious on the second half of the year... full-year revenue outlook was raised to low-to-mid single digits."
*   **Marketing Spend:** "We still expect marketing as a percentage of sales to be approximately 7.3% in fiscal '26."
*   **Capex:** "In Fiscal 2026, we expect to spend approximately 4% to 5% of net revenues on capital expenditures." (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 62)
*   **Macro Environment:** Management remains "cautious on the second half of the year due to potential tariff-related pressures on broader consumer behavior."

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Year 1): 3.5%**. This represents the midpoint of management's "low-to-mid single digits" guidance for Fiscal 2026. (Q1 FY26 Transcript, August 7, 2025)
*   **Revenue Growth (Years 2-5): 3.0%**. This rate assumes a slight moderation from the guided year, reflecting a blend of historical performance and long-term strategic goals against a cautious macroeconomic backdrop.
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT): 13.5% (stable)**. The TTM operating margin was 13.2%. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. F-3). The average operating margin for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 was 11.8%. Given strong Q1 FY26 performance but cautions about the second half, a stable margin slightly above the most recent full-year result is a reasonable base-case assumption, implying efficiency gains offset inflationary and tariff pressures.
*   **Tax Rate: 22.0%**. The reported effective tax rate in Fiscal 2025 was 21.9%. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 49). The rate in Fiscal 2024 was an unusually low 16.9% due to one-time benefits. A rate of 22.0% is a reasonable normalized assumption.
*   **Capex as % of Revenue: 4.5%**. This is the midpoint of management's guided range of 4% to 5% of revenue for Fiscal 2026. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 62)
*   **D&A as % of Revenue: 3.1%**. This is consistent with the Fiscal 2025 ratio (219.6 / 7079.0). (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. F-3, F-5)
*   **SBC as % of Revenue: 1.5%**. This is consistent with the Fiscal 2025 ratio (107.9 / 7079.0). (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. F-3, F-5)
*   **Change in NWC as % of Incremental Revenue: 5.0%**. This is based on historical averages, implying a modest investment in working capital is required to support growth.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $7,326.8 | $7,546.6 | $7,773.0 | $8,006.2 | $8,246.4 |
| EBIT (13.5%) | $989.1 | $1,018.8 | $1,049.4 | $1,080.8 | $1,113.3 |
| NOPAT | $771.5 | $794.7 | $818.5 | $843.1 | $868.3 |
| D&A | $227.1 | $233.9 | $240.9 | $248.2 | $255.6 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($109.9) | ($113.2) | ($116.6) | ($120.1) | ($123.7) |
| Capex | ($329.7) | ($339.6) | ($349.8) | ($360.3) | ($371.1) |
| Change in NWC | ($12.4) | ($11.0) | ($11.3) | ($11.7) | ($12.0) |
| **FCFF** | **$546.6** | **$564.8** | **$581.7** | **$599.2** | **$617.1** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.3%** (Current 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Beta:** **1.50** (5-Year Monthly Beta). This reflects higher volatility than the broader market, which is justified given the cyclical nature of the luxury apparel industry and brand-specific risks.
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**. A standard premium for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Calculation:** `4.3% + 1.50 * 5.0% = 11.8%`

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** `Interest Expense / Total Debt`
    *   **Calculation:** `$44.1M / $1,142.6M = 3.9%`.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt:** `3.9% * (1 - 22.0%) = 3.0%`.

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)`
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** $18,262.4M ($285.35/share * 64.0M shares).
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $1,142.6M (book value used as proxy). (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. F-2)
    *   **Total Capital (E+D):** $19,405.0M
    *   **Weight of Equity (E/(E+D)):** 94.1%
    *   **Weight of Debt (D/(E+D)):** 5.9%
    *   **WACC Calculation:** `(0.941 * 11.8%) + (0.059 * 3.0%) = 11.1% + 0.2% = 11.3%`

---

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This is a reasonable long-term growth assumption, capped at long-run inflation expectations for a mature company.
    *   **Calculation:** `($617.1M * (1 + 0.025)) / (11.3% - 2.5%) = $632.5M / 8.8% = $7,187.5M`

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT ($1,113.3M) + D&A ($255.6M) = $1,368.9M
    *   **Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple:** Terminal Value ($7,187.5M) / Year 5 EBITDA ($1,368.9M) = **5.2x**. This is a conservative multiple, suggesting the Gordon Growth assumption is reasonable and not overly aggressive for a stable apparel company.

---

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   `($546.6 / 1.113^1) + ($564.8 / 1.113^2) + ($581.7 / 1.113^3) + ($599.2 / 1.113^4) + ($617.1 / 1.113^5) = $491.1 + $457.0 + $424.8 + $394.7 + $366.5 = $2,134.1M`
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** `$7,187.5M / 1.113^5 = $4,260.6M`
*   **Enterprise Value:** `$2,134.1M + $4,260.6M = $6,394.7M`
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   **Net Debt:** Total Debt ($1,142.6M) - Cash & Equivalents ($1,922.5M) = -$780.0M (Net Cash). (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. F-2)
    *   **Calculation:** `$6,394.7M - (-$780.0M) = $7,174.7M`

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   **Calculation:** `$7,174.7M / 64.0M shares = **$112.10**`

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $112.10**. Assumes 3.0-3.5% revenue growth and stable 13.5% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $85 - $95**. Assumes lower revenue growth (1-2%) and margin compression (to 12.0%) due to tariff impacts and increased promotional activity.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $130 - $140**. Assumes higher revenue growth (4-5%) and modest margin expansion (to 14.5%) as brand elevation strategies succeed and international growth accelerates more than expected.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a **30% discount** to the base-case fair value provides a target purchase price that accounts for estimation errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price:** `$112.10 * (1 - 0.30) = **$78.47**`

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** The company's performance is sensitive to discretionary consumer spending, which could be negatively impacted by inflation, high interest rates, and potential tariffs, as noted by management's cautious outlook. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 24)
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The apparel industry is highly competitive. Failure to anticipate fashion trends, manage inventory effectively, and maintain brand image in a highly promotional environment could erode margins and market share. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 30)
3.  **Wholesale Channel Concentration:** A significant portion of revenue comes from a few large department store customers. Consolidation, financial instability, or a shift in strategy from these key partners could materially impact revenue and profitability. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 32)
4.  **Supply Chain and Sourcing Risk:** Approximately 96% of products are produced outside the U.S., primarily in Asia. This exposes the company to geopolitical risks, shipping disruptions, and changes in trade policy, including the tariffs management has expressed concern over. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 29)
5.  **Dependence on Key Personnel:** The brand is intrinsically linked to its founder, Mr. Ralph Lauren. The loss of his services or other key executives could negatively impact brand image and strategic direction. (10-K, May 22, 2025, p. 28)

final answer is 112.10 $
