### **D) Free Cash Flow Build**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Change in NWC`

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale / Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **9.79%** | `Formula: Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium` |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (YCharts, Aug 20, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard market premium assumption. |
| Levered Beta | 1.10 | Reflects cyclicality of the home improvement sector. |

| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 4.07% | Inferred from FY2024 financials (10-K, Jan 31, 2025). |
| **Market Weights** | | `Based on current market data` |
| Market Cap (E) | $146,055M | $257.14/share (Aug 20, 2025) * 568M shares. |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Inputs | Calculation | Result (USD, millions) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth** | FCFF Y5: $7,815M<br>WACC: 8.5%<br>Growth Rate (g): 2.5% | `(7,815 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.085 - 0.025)` | **$133,565** |
| **Exit Multiple (Cross-Check)** | EBITDA Y5: $12,617M<br>Median Multiple: 12.9x | `12,617 * 12.9` | **$162,759** |

*   **EBITDA Year 5 Calculation:** EBIT Y5 ($10,781M) + D&A Y5 ($1,836M) = $12,617M.
*   **Median Multiple Source:** 10-year median EV/EBITDA for LOW is 12.9x (GuruFocus, Aug 21, 2025).
*   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value. This value will be used for the base-case valuation.

### **One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include macroeconomic headwinds, such as higher interest rates and a slowdown in the housing market, which could suppress consumer demand for big-ticket discretionary home improvement projects. Increased competition from other large retailers and online-only players could pressure margins more than anticipated in the forecast. Supply chain disruptions and commodity price volatility (e.g., lumber) remain persistent risks that could impact both revenue and profitability. Finally, the success of the company's strategy to grow its Pro customer base is critical to achieving its growth targets, and any failure to effectively capture this market could lead to underperformance.

final answer is 149.79 $
