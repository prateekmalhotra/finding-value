**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mattel's growth strategy centers on its iconic brands like Barbie, Hot Wheels, and Fisher-Price, which it extends into new product lines, digital experiences, and entertainment content.

This strategy, combined with digital ventures and a global retail network, suggests a multi-faceted approach to growth beyond traditional toy sales.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mattel is actively investing in new avenues for its brands.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is limited publicly available information to definitively assess the effectiveness of Mattel's R&D in relation to its size. While the company's collaboration with OpenAI suggests a forward-looking approach to innovation, specific metrics on R&D productivity, such as the success rate of new product launches or R&D as a percentage of revenue versus peers, are not readily available in the provided sources. Without more data, a definitive "Yes" is not supported.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mattel has a global sales presence, operating through North America, International, and American Girl segments, and sells its products through a wide range of channels, including omnichannel retailers, discount and toy stores, and direct-to-consumer. The company's point-of-sale was up in all regions in the second quarter and first half of 2025, indicating strong retail performance. This demonstrates a robust and effective sales organization.

**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mattel's investor relations page lists a comprehensive executive team beyond the CEO, including a CFO, CTO, Chief People Officer, Chief Brand Officer, and heads of Mattel Films and Television Studios.

**Answer:** Yes

The formation of Mattel Studios to create film and television content based on its brands is a significant differentiator.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary on the Q2 2025 earnings call emphasized a long-term strategy, with investments in entertainment and digital innovation. The guidance for the full year 2025, with adjusted EPS between $1.54 and $1.66 and free cash flow of approximately $500 million, suggests a focus on sustainable profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mattel is generating significant cash flow, with a 2025 forecast of approximately $500 million, and is actively returning capital to shareholders through a targeted $600 million in share repurchases for the year. This indicates a strong financial position that does not necessitate dilutive equity financing.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On the Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed challenges, such as the disproportionate effect of trade-related uncertainty on Fisher-Price's performance in the U.S. and the planned exits of certain product lines. This willingness to address headwinds and provide a revised outlook demonstrates transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided SEC filings and search results do not contain any information regarding legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would bring management's integrity into question. In the absence of negative evidence, and based on the company's long-standing reputation, a provisional "Yes" can be given.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis:**
Mattel's strengths lie in its iconic brand portfolio, which provides a long runway for growth through product innovation, entertainment, and digital experiences. The company is demonstrating a commitment to evolving its business model, as evidenced by the formation of Mattel Studios and its collaboration with OpenAI. Financially, Mattel appears to be on solid footing, with improving margins, strong cash flow, and a commitment to shareholder returns. The primary areas of uncertainty, and thus the factors most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months, are the effectiveness of its R&D and the quality of its labor and executive relations, for which more data is needed. To turn the "No" answers to "Yes," evidence of successful new product launches, improved R&D productivity metrics, and positive disclosures on employee and executive relations would be required.
