### B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION

*   **Full Year 2025 Net Sales:** "Our full year 2025 net sales outlook calls for sales of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion or down 1% to up 1% year-over-year." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 1, 2025).

### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

*   **Revenue Forecast:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** We will use the midpoint of management's guidance, which is a 0% growth rate, resulting in revenue of $3,412 million.
    *   **Years 2-5:** We will assume a conservative 3% annual growth rate, reflecting a blend of historical performance and management's cautious tone.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** We will use the TTM operating margin of 7.99% and hold it constant throughout the forecast period. We do not have sufficient evidence of specific business initiatives to justify margin expansion.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** We will use the TTM effective tax rate of 24.40%.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** We will model capex as 1.8% of revenue, in line with the TTM capex-to-revenue ratio (62.05 / 3412).
    *   **Working Capital:** We will model the change in working capital as -1.7% of the change in revenue, consistent with the TTM ratio (-56.83/ (3412-3369)).
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** We will treat SBC as a real economic cost and subtract it from FCFF. We will hold it constant at the TTM level of $24.57 million.
    *   **Diluted Share Count:** We will use the latest reported diluted weighted-average shares of 56 million.

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | EBIT(1-t) | D&A | SBC | Capex | Change in WC | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $3,412 | $272.62 | $206.10 | $54.73 | $24.57 | $61.42 | $0.00 | $174.84 |
| 2 | $3,514 | $280.79 | $212.26 | $56.37 | $24.57 | $63.26 | ($1.74) | $182.54 |
| 3 | $3,619 | $289.22 | $218.66 | $58.06 | $24.57 | $65.15 | ($1.79) | $188.80 |
| 4 | $3,728 | $297.89 | $225.21 | $59.81 | $24.57 | $67.11 | ($1.85) | $195.19 |
| 5 | $3,840 | $306.83 | $231.96 | $61.60 | $24.57 | $69.12 | ($1.90) | $201.77 |

*FCFF is used for valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.*

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year Treasury Yield as of August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.2 (Sourced from Yahoo Finance, reflecting the company's cyclicality and operational leverage).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.2 * 5.0% = 10.25%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Given the net cash position and negligible interest expense, we will assume a 0% cost of debt.
*   **WACC:**
    *   With a 0% cost of debt, the WACC is equal to the cost of equity.
    *   **WACC = 10.25%**

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (in line with long-run inflation expectations).
    *   **Terminal Value = FCFF(Year 5) * (1 + g) / (WACC - g) = $201.77 * (1.025) / (0.1025 - 0.025) = $2,668.61 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $306.83 + $61.60 = $368.43 million**
    *   **Historical Median EV/EBITDA Multiple:** 10x (approximate 5-10 year median for the sector)
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $368.43 * 10 = $3,684.3 million**
*   **Conclusion:** There is a significant discrepancy between the two methods. We will use the more conservative Gordon Growth terminal value of **$2,668.61 million**.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF = $174.84/(1.1025)^1 + $182.54/(1.1025)^2 + $188.80/(1.1025)^3 + $195.19/(1.1025)^4 + $201.77/(1.1025)^5 = $158.58 + $150.11 + $141.97 + $134.14 + $123.63 = $708.43 million**
    *   **PV of Terminal Value = $2,668.61 / (1.1025)^5 = $1,637.26 million**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $708.43 + $1,637.26 = $2,345.69 million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $481.19 - $427.8 = $53.39 million**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt = $2,345.69 - $53.39 = $2,292.30 million**

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Share Count = $2,292.30 / 56 = $40.93**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $40.93
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** A scenario with 1% revenue growth and 7% operating margins would result in a value of approximately **$32**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** A scenario with 5% revenue growth and 9% operating margins would result in a value of approximately **$55**.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **MOS Price (30% discount) = $40.93 * (1 - 0.30) = $28.65**

### I) ONE-PARAGRAPH RISK NOTES

The key risks to this valuation are: a sustained downturn in consumer discretionary spending, which would negatively impact revenue growth; increased competition leading to margin pressure; and supply chain disruptions, which could impact inventory levels and profitability. Additionally, the company's ability to successfully execute its "ACCELERATE Growth Strategy" and attract a younger consumer base is a significant uncertainty. Finally, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could also materially impact reported earnings.

final answer is 40.93 $
