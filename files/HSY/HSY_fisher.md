Company: The Hershey Company (HSY)
Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K filed February 18, 2025 (for fiscal year ended December 31, 2024), press releases, and reputable news sources.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Hershey Company operates in the global confectionery and salty snacks markets, which are both projected to grow steadily. The global confectionery market is forecasted to grow at a CAGR of 3-6% through 2030, while the salty snacks market is expected to grow at 4-6% annually. Hershey is expanding its portfolio to capture more snacking occasions and has set a long-term net sales growth target of 2-4% annually, which it reaffirmed in February 2025. This growth is supported by its core brands, expansion into salty snacks (e.g., SkinnyPop, Dot's Pretzels), and strategic acquisitions like Sour Strips.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey demonstrates a commitment to ongoing development through both product innovation and process improvement. The company's 2024 10-K states, "We devote considerable resources to the identification, development, testing, manufacturing and marketing of new products." This is evidenced by strategic acquisitions to enter new categories, such as purchasing the Sour Strips brand in November 2024. Furthermore, in February 2024, the company launched the "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative," a multi-year program to modernize its supply chain and automate processes, targeting $300 million in annual savings by 2026.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey’s R&D spending is modest relative to its size and competitors. In fiscal year 2024, the company's R&D expense was $55.8 million, or approximately 0.5% of its $11.2 billion in net sales. This is lower than key competitors like Mondelez, which spends about 1.1% of revenue on R&D, and Nestlé, which spends around 1.8%. While spending is low, Hershey's ability to maintain its position as the largest player in the U.S. confectionery market suggests its R&D, focused on brand extensions and strategic acquisitions, is effective enough to sustain its leadership.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey possesses a dominant sales and distribution network in its core North American market. The company holds approximately 24% of the U.S. confectionery market share, making it the largest player. Its products are ubiquitous across key channels, including wholesale distributors, grocery chains, mass merchandisers, and convenience stores. One customer, McLane Company, Inc., which is the primary distributor to Walmart, accounted for 27% of consolidated net sales in 2024, underscoring the depth and importance of its key customer relationships. This market leadership and deep channel penetration indicate a highly effective, above-average sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company consistently generates strong profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Hershey reported a gross margin of 47.3% and an operating profit margin of 25.9%. These figures represent an improvement from 44.8% and 22.9%, respectively, in the prior year. Historically, Hershey has maintained higher profitability than key competitors; for example, a 2022 comparison showed Hershey's gross and net income margins were superior to those of Mondelez.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to protect margins against significant commodity inflation. The company is implementing price increases across its portfolio to offset higher input costs, as noted in its 2024 10-K. Concurrently, it launched the "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative" in February 2024, a multi-year program targeting $300 million in annual savings through supply chain optimization and automation by 2026. This dual approach of exercising pricing power while aggressively managing the cost structure is central to its margin improvement strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Evidence on labor relations is mixed and contains significant negative points. While the 2024 10-K notes positive aspects like being "Great Place to Work" certified and achieving pay equity, it also states that 33% of its global workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements. More concerningly, in December 2023, the National Labor Relations Board ordered a new union election at a Virginia plant, finding the company's conduct influenced the prior vote and requiring a $200,000 settlement for a fired employee. Reports from 2022 cited allegations of "brutal conditions," forced overtime, and the use of union-busting consultants at the same facility. These issues contradict the claim of outstanding labor relations.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows signs of stability, with the majority of executive officers having been promoted from within the organization, as detailed in the 2024 10-K. This suggests a cohesive long-term management team and a functioning succession plan. However, insider ownership by executives is very low at just 0.34%, which may indicate a lack of alignment with shareholder interests. While day-to-day relations appear stable, the low level of direct ownership is a point of weakness.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey has a well-defined management structure with clear leadership across its key segments and functions. The 2024 10-K lists nine executive officers beyond the CEO, including presidents for its U.S. Confection, Salty Snacks, and International segments, as well as heads of Supply Chain, HR, and Technology. The fact that most of these leaders were promoted internally indicates significant bench strength and institutional knowledge. This structure provides clear operational leadership and mitigates key-person risk associated with the CEO.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey's accounting controls appear robust and meet regulatory standards. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The 10-K provides detailed segment reporting and breakdowns of costs, demonstrating adequate cost analysis for investors. While the auditor noted trade promotion accruals as a "critical audit matter," this highlights the complexity of the estimate rather than a control deficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey's key competitive advantages are its iconic brands and its powerful distribution network in North America, which create significant brand equity and scale efficiencies. The company's ability to maintain a leading 24% market share in the U.S. confectionery market is a testament to its brand loyalty and retail execution. Furthermore, in an industry heavily exposed to volatile commodity costs (especially cocoa), Hershey's sophisticated procurement and hedging program, detailed in its 10-K, is a crucial capability for managing profitability versus less-scaled competitors.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a long-range outlook by making significant multi-year investments in its operating model. The "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative" is a prime example, incurring short-term costs with expected long-term annual savings of $300 million after 2026. Additionally, the company's strategy, outlined at the February 2025 CAGNY conference, focuses on balancing near-term headwinds like cocoa inflation with long-term goals of portfolio diversification and capability-building. This willingness to invest in future efficiency and growth, even while managing current market pressures, supports a long-range view.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a very strong financial position that obviates the need for dilutive equity financing. In 2024, Hershey generated $2.5 billion in cash from operations. The balance sheet is solid, and the company has a $1.35 billion unsecured revolving credit facility for liquidity. Rather than issuing shares, Hershey has a history of returning capital to shareholders; in 2024, it paid $1.1 billion in dividends and repurchased $494 million of its common stock under authorized buyback programs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Although a direct review of recent earnings call transcripts was not possible, other communications suggest a high degree of candor. In its February 2025 CAGNY conference presentation, management openly addressed significant headwinds, including record-high cocoa prices, margin pressures, and the impact of tariffs. The company provided a full-year outlook that included a "down mid-30% range" forecast for adjusted EPS, demonstrating a willingness to communicate negative news forthrightly rather than obscuring challenges.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is facing several legal and regulatory challenges that call its integrity into question. There is an active class-action lawsuit alleging the company falsely advertises the appearance of its Reese's seasonal products, another lawsuit alleging its packaging contains undisclosed PFAS "forever chemicals," and a class-action lawsuit for alleged violations of federal wage and hour laws. While litigation is common for large corporations, the nature of these lawsuits—spanning deceptive marketing, product safety, and labor practices—creates a pattern that prevents a conclusion of "unquestionable integrity."

**Synthesis (5–7 sentences):**
The Hershey Company scores 12 out of 15 on the Fisher checklist, revealing a financially robust and well-managed market leader burdened by significant ESG-related concerns. The company's strengths are its dominant market position in North America, strong profitability, and a clear strategy for growth and margin preservation through pricing, innovation, and efficiency programs. However, the analysis uncovered notable weaknesses in labor relations and legal integrity. Multiple lawsuits concerning marketing, product safety, and labor practices, combined with a contentious unionization effort at a key plant, challenge the company's reputation. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12–24 months are the outcomes of the various class-action lawsuits and the result of the NLRB-mandated union election in Virginia. A resolution of the lawsuits in Hershey's favor and a demonstrated improvement in employee relations would be required to flip the respective "No" answers to "Yes."

fisher score is 12 / 15
