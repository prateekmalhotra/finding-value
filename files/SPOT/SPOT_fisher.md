Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 20-F for FY 2024 (filed early 2025), Form 6-K for Q2 2025 (filed July 29, 2025), and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (July 29, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify is the world's largest audio streaming service and continues to experience strong growth in its user base. In Q2 2025, Monthly Active Users (MAUs) grew 11% year-over-year to 696 million, and Premium Subscribers grew 12% to 276 million. The company is expanding beyond music into podcasts and audiobooks, with the latter recently launching in several European markets. This strategy significantly expands its Total Addressable Market (TAM) from music streaming to the entire audio landscape, providing a long runway for sales growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify has consistently demonstrated a commitment to evolving its product. After establishing a lead in music, it invested heavily in podcasts. More recently, the company has expanded into audiobooks and introduced features like the AI-powered "DJ". CEO Daniel Ek stated on the Q2 2025 earnings call, "By constantly evolving, we create more and more value for the almost 700 million people using our platform." This evolution into a comprehensive audio platform, including new subscription add-ons like Audiobooks+, confirms a long-term development strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify's R&D is focused on improving personalization, discovery, and the user experience, which drives engagement and retention. The launch and expansion of its AI DJ to over 60 markets and the development of new ad technologies are key outputs of this investment. The company's ability to grow MAUs to 696 million suggests its R&D is effective at creating an engaging product. While a direct peer comparison of R&D as a percentage of revenue is difficult due to competitors being part of larger firms, Spotify's product-led growth indicates effective R&D.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The evidence for this point is mixed. The Premium business, which accounts for the majority of revenue, is driven by a self-serve subscription model rather than a traditional sales force. However, the Advertising business relies on a sales organization. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Daniel Ek noted, "the one area that hasn't yet better expectations is our Ads business. We've simply been moving too slowly." While ad revenue grew, this comment suggests the sales and ad-tech organization is not yet performing at an above-average level.
**Answer:** No

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify has demonstrated significant progress in profitability. For the full fiscal year 2024, the company achieved a net income of €1.14 billion, a notable turnaround from the €532 million loss in 2023. In Q2 2025, the Gross Margin expanded by 227 basis points year-over-year to 31.5%, and the company reported an operating income of €406 million. While historically low, these recent results show a clear trajectory towards sustained and worthwhile profit margins.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin expansion. Key levers include periodic price increases for its Premium plans, which have boosted ARPU, and growing its "Marketplace" services for artists. In the Q2 2025 earnings report, CFO Christian Luiga attributed margin expansion to premium revenue growth outpacing content costs and gains in the ad-supported business. The company is also focused on improving operational efficiency and is transitioning its advertising business to a new, more efficient tech stack.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify has undergone significant organizational changes, including layoffs in late 2023 and early 2024, as part of a focus on efficiency. While such actions can strain employee relations, there is no widespread public evidence of outstandingly poor labor relations, such as major union disputes or strikes. The company's 2024 20-F details its human capital strategy, emphasizing a commitment to a dynamic and inclusive culture. Without more specific data on employee turnover or engagement, it's difficult to classify relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, led by co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek, has been relatively stable at the highest level. Key long-term leaders like Alex Norström and Gustav Söderström have recently been elevated to Co-Presidents, indicating a strong internal leadership pipeline. This structure suggests a collaborative and stable executive environment. There have been no public reports of significant infighting or abrupt high-level departures that would suggest poor executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify has a well-defined management team with clear areas of responsibility. The appointment of Alex Norström (Chief Business Officer) and Gustav Söderström (Chief Product and Technology Officer) as Co-Presidents demonstrates leadership depth below the CEO. The company also has a seasoned CFO, Christian Luiga. This structure with experienced leaders overseeing the core functions of business, product, and finance suggests a strong and deep management bench.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly listed foreign private issuer in the U.S., Spotify is subject to stringent accounting and reporting standards under IFRS and the SEC. Its financial statements are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers S.à r.l. The 2024 Form 20-F contains detailed segment reporting and a granular breakdown of costs. There is no history of major restatements or public disclosure of material weaknesses in internal controls, suggesting its controls are robust.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify's key competitive advantage lies in its singular focus on audio, unlike competitors such as Apple, Google, and Amazon, for whom music is an ancillary service. This focus has allowed Spotify to build a powerful discovery engine and personalization algorithms (e.g., Discover Weekly, AI DJ), creating strong user lock-in and network effects. Having celebrated its 10th anniversary, the Discover Weekly feature alone has driven over 100 billion streams, a testament to its industry-leading personalization capabilities.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Historically, Spotify has prioritized user growth and market expansion over short-term profits, exemplified by its massive multi-year investments in the podcasting business. While the company has recently shifted to emphasize efficiency and profitability, its continued investment in new verticals like audiobooks shows it is still willing to invest for the long term. Management's commentary in the Q2 2025 earnings call highlighted strategic investments to "accelerate our long-term growth ambitions."
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Spotify has a very strong balance sheet. At the end of Q2 2025, the company had €8.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and generated €700 million in free cash flow during the quarter. In July 2025, the Board approved a $1 billion increase to its share repurchase program, bringing the total authorization to $2 billion. This strong cash position, positive free cash flow, and commitment to share buybacks indicate a very low risk of dilutive equity financing.

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a high degree of candor. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Daniel Ek openly admitted to shortcomings in the advertising business, stating, "We've simply been moving too slowly and it's taken longer than expected to see the improvements we initiated to take hold." Similarly, the CFO clearly explained why operating income missed guidance, citing higher-than-forecast social charges. This willingness to openly discuss underperformance and challenges is a strong indicator of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags regarding management's integrity. A review of the company's 2024 Form 20-F and recent filings does not reveal any material related-party transactions, governance issues, or ongoing legal proceedings that would call the integrity of the senior management team into question. The company is subject to the corporate governance standards of the NYSE and Luxembourg law, and there is no evidence to suggest a culture of questionable practices.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**

Spotify scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its market leadership, strong growth, and recent turn toward profitability. The company's strongest attributes are its long runway for growth in the audio market, its deep competitive moat built on personalization and focus, its robust financial position, and a transparent, stable management team. The primary weaknesses identified are an underperforming advertising sales organization and a lack of clear evidence of "outstanding" labor relations following recent restructurings. The Fisher score will most likely be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to execute on its advertising business turnaround and successfully scale the audiobooks vertical to contribute meaningfully to revenue and margins. A clear acceleration in ad revenue growth would flip point #4 to "Yes," while any signs of internal turmoil or inability to retain key talent could change the answers on management and personnel relations.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
