### Dimension Analysis

**1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** The company's primary network effect stems from its TwinSpires online wagering platform, one of the largest in the U.S. Pari-mutuel wagering pools benefit from a classic network effect where more liquidity (wagerers) leads to more stable odds and larger potential payouts, attracting more users. While strong, this effect is contained within the horse racing vertical and faces competition from other wagering platforms.
**Evidence:**
- TwinSpires is described as one of the "largest and most profitable legal online horse racing wagering platforms in the U.S." (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- The company provides white-label advance deposit wagering (ADW) platforms and technology services to major players like FanDuel and DraftKings, demonstrating the strength and reach of its wagering network infrastructure. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5

**2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for the majority of individual customers are low, as they can easily move between different betting platforms. However, for B2B customers of United Tote (wagering systems) and Exacta (HRM systems), switching costs are moderately high due to technology integration, training, and contractual obligations. The lack of specific churn data or contract lengths warrants a conservative score.
**Evidence:**
- United Tote provides totalisator services for numerous third-party racetracks and OTBs, which involves deep integration into their operations. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- Exacta provides the central determinant system technology for HRMs at both company-owned and third-party venues, creating technical lock-in for its partners. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** A moderate cost advantage is inferred from the company's scale and vertical integration. The 2023 acquisition of Exacta Systems allows the company to deploy historical racing machine (HRM) technology in its own rapidly growing venues without paying third-party fees, a significant synergy. Furthermore, the scale of the TwinSpires wagering platform likely provides a per-user cost advantage over smaller competitors.
**Evidence:**
- The acquisition of Exacta enables CHDN to deliver a diverse gaming library to its own venues, which creates significant synergies. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- Management stated that the Live and Historical Racing segment Adjusted EBITDA increased in 2024 in part due to "lower fees related to the Exacta technology used in the Company's HRM operations." (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** The company's ownership of the Kentucky Derby is an exceptionally powerful and virtually impossible-to-replicate intangible asset. This iconic brand provides immense pricing power, drives lucrative sponsorship and media deals, and has growing cultural relevance. This single asset is one of the strongest brand-based moats in the entertainment industry.
**Evidence:**
- The Kentucky Derby is the "longest continuously held annual sporting event in the U.S." and the company's "most iconic and enduring asset." (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- Management refers to the Kentucky Derby as a "truly unique trophy asset" and noted record-breaking viewership in 2025, with nearly 18 million average viewers and over 285 million social media impressions, a 67% increase from 2024. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 24, 2025).
- The company extended its media rights agreement with NBC Sports to host the Kentucky Derby through 2032. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 5 / 5

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** CHDN has built a dense and wide distribution network of physical gaming assets in legally protected, limited-license jurisdictions. It is difficult and expensive for competitors to replicate this footprint of racetracks, casinos, and HRM venues. This creates efficient scale, where the addition of new properties into their existing state-level operations provides significant advantages.
**Evidence:**
- The company operates live and historical racing venues in Kentucky, Virginia, and New Hampshire, and ten wholly-owned casino properties in nine states. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- The company is executing a strategy of high-return capital investments into its physical distribution, including the $460 million Rose Gaming Resort in Virginia and the $290 million Terre Haute Casino Resort in Indiana. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- Management highlighted continued progress and growth from The Rose in Virginia as an "important growth driver." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 24, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5

**6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** The company aggregates vast amounts of customer data through its TwinSpires platform, casino loyalty programs, and live event ticketing. This data offers a potential advantage in personalizing marketing and promotions. However, the company does not explicitly detail a proprietary data feedback loop that materially improves its core products over competitors, warranting a conservative score.
**Evidence:**
- TwinSpires offers the Bloodstock Research Information Services platform, which provides horse racing statistical data, indicating ownership of valuable, specialized datasets. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- Inference: The operation of loyalty programs across numerous casino properties and a large online wagering database provides a significant, hard-to-replicate dataset on gaming and wagering behavior.
**Score:** 2 / 5

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** CHDN is building a B2B ecosystem around its wagering and HRM technology. The acquisition of Exacta, whose systems support multiple third-party game vendors, creates a platform that attracts developers. Similarly, providing ADW infrastructure to other major brands builds a platform around its core wagering technology.
**Evidence:**
- The Exacta system "supports multiple game vendors and virtually unlimited math modeling capabilities on a single central determinant system," making it an attractive platform for third-party game developers. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- The company provides ADW "white-label platforms" and technology services to third parties including FanDuel and DraftKings. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The company's operations exist almost entirely within industries defined by high, government-mandated barriers to entry. Casino gaming, horse racing, and pari-mutuel wagering require a limited number of state-issued licenses that are difficult and expensive to obtain. This regulatory framework is the bedrock of the company's moat, as it legally restricts the number of competitors.
**Evidence:**
- The ownership, operation, and management of all three company segments are subject to extensive regulation and licensing under the laws of each jurisdiction of operation. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- Gaming laws in many jurisdictions limit the number of licenses granted to operate gaming facilities, and these licenses are generally not transferable without approval. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 5 / 5

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The company's core assets—racetracks and casinos—are extremely capital-intensive and highly specific, making them nearly impossible to repurpose and very costly for a new entrant to replicate. Sunk costs are exceptionally high, which strongly deters new competition.
**Evidence:**
- Recent capital projects include the $460 million Rose Gaming Resort and the $290 million Terre Haute Casino Resort. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- The company's balance sheet shows Property and Equipment, net of USD 2.9 billion. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- The Churchill Downs Racetrack itself sits on 175 acres and has undergone numerous, expensive, multi-year capital investment projects, such as the recently completed "Paddock Project". (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 5 / 5

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** While the majority of CHDN's revenue is transactional and has low visibility, a small but meaningful portion is secured by multi-year contracts. These include media rights for the Kentucky Derby, venue sponsorships, and personal seat licenses, which provide a predictable, recurring revenue stream.
**Evidence:**
- As of December 31, 2024, the company had remaining performance obligations on contracts with a duration greater than one year totaling USD 271.0 million, related to television rights, sponsorships, PSLs, and admissions. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
- The company extended its agreement with NBC Sports to broadcast the Kentucky Derby through 2032, providing long-term revenue visibility for its most important media asset. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### Aggregation

- **Weighted Score Calculation:**
  (3 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (5 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.08) + (5 * 0.06) + (5 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0.54 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.60 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.24 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.04 = **3.27**
- **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 32.7 / 100

### Mapping

- The numeric weighted score of 32.7 falls within the 30 ≤ Weighted < 50 threshold.
- This maps to a final integer moat rating of 2. *Correction*: Per the prompt, the weighted score is a percentage. Therefore, my calculation `3.27` is incorrect. I must re-calculate based on `score * weight` not `score * weight %`.

- **Corrected Weighted Score Calculation:**
  (3 * 18) + (2 * 15) + (3 * 15) + (5 * 12) + (4 * 10) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 8) + (5 * 6) + (5 * 4) + (2 * 2) = 54 + 30 + 45 + 60 + 40 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 20 + 4 = **327**
This is also incorrect. The weights are percentages. So the first calculation was correct in method, but I need to multiply by 100 at the end.
- **Final Corrected Weighted Score Calculation:**
  (3 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (5 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.08) + (5 * 0.06) + (5 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0.54 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.60 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.24 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.04 = 3.27. The prompt example gives a `72.4/100` score. So `score_dim * weight_dim` is likely `score * weight%`. Let me recalculate:
  (3 * 18) + (2 * 15) + (3 * 15) + (5 * 12) + (4 * 10) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 8) + (5 * 6) + (5 * 4) + (2 * 2) = 54 + 30 + 45 + 60 + 40 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 20 + 4 = **327**. This seems too high. The total is out of `5 * 100 = 500`. So 327/500 = 65.4.
Let's try one more way, `raw score * weight`.
(3 * 18) + (2 * 15) + (3 * 15) + (5 * 12) + (4 * 10) + (2 * 10) + (3 * 8) + (5 * 6) + (5 * 4) + (2 * 2) = 54 + 30 + 45 + 60 + 40 + 20 + 24 + 30 + 20 + 4 = **327**. This is still not on a 100 point scale. Re-reading instructions: "Compute a weighted score = sum(score_dim * weight_dim)". The weights are given as percentages. Let's assume the score is `raw_score / 5` multiplied by the weight percentage.
((3/5)\*18) + ((2/5)\*15) + ((3/5)\*15) + ((5/5)\*12) + ((4/5)\*10) + ((2/5)\*10) + ((3/5)\*8) + ((5/5)\*6) + ((5/5)\*4) + ((2/5)\*2) = 10.8 + 6 + 9 + 12 + 8 + 4 + 4.8 + 6 + 4 + 0.8 = **65.4**

- **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 65.4 / 100
- The score of 65.4 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 threshold, which maps to a final integer moat rating of 3.

### Moat Duration Justification

The company's moat is durable and estimated to last 10–15 years. This durability is primarily anchored by two factors: the timeless, impossible-to-replicate brand of the Kentucky Derby and the high regulatory barriers to entry in the casino and racing industries. The media rights for the Derby are secured through 2032, providing a clear window of visibility, while the portfolio of state-issued gaming licenses grants long-term, quasi-monopolistic rights in many key geographies. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios

1.  **Federal-level gambling regulation:** A change in federal law, such as a federal online gaming bill or an amendment to the Interstate Horseracing Act, could supersede state-by-state licensing regimes, lowering barriers to entry and diminishing CHDN's entrenched regulatory advantages. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
2.  **Brand damage to the Kentucky Derby:** A significant scandal related to animal welfare, race integrity, or a major safety incident at the event could tarnish the Derby's iconic brand, reducing its pricing power and cultural relevance. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
3.  **Adverse legal rulings on Historical Racing Machines (HRMs):** HRMs are a key growth driver, and their legal status is based on state-specific interpretations of pari-mutuel law. A negative court ruling, such as the one currently under appeal in Louisiana, could declare HRMs illegal in a key state, eliminating a significant source of high-margin revenue. (Form 10-K, Feb 21, 2025).

### KPIs to Monitor

-   **Derby Week Adjusted EBITDA:** Growth indicates strengthening brand power; stagnation or decline would be a major red flag.
-   **HRM Net Revenue per Day:** Monitor this for both Kentucky and Virginia properties to track the performance and return on these key capital investments.
-   **TwinSpires Active Users/Handle Growth:** A decline in market share or handle would indicate erosion of the wagering network effect.
-   **Adjusted EBITDA Margins (Gaming Segment):** A compression in margins could indicate rising competitive pressure in regional casino markets.
-   **Capital Expenditures as a % of Revenue:** A significant drop could indicate a lack of growth opportunities, while a sustained spike without corresponding EBITDA growth could signal poor capital allocation.
-   **Status of Louisiana HRM Litigation:** Monitor for updates on the legal challenge to the 2021 HHR Act.
-   **New State License Applications/Awards:** Track success in entering new regulatory jurisdictions.

### Short Verdict Paragraph

Churchill Downs' moat rating is a strong 3, bordering on a 4, primarily due to its combination of an unparalleled intangible asset in the Kentucky Derby and entrenched regulatory barriers across its gaming and racing segments. These two pillars provide significant pricing power and legally restrict competition. The company's strategic expansion into a network of capital-intensive HRM facilities in limited-license states further solidifies this advantage. An upgrade to a 4 would require stronger evidence of durable, high switching costs in its B2B segment or clear proof of a data-driven feedback loop creating a product advantage. Conversely, a significant legal setback for HRMs or any event that tarnishes the Derby's brand would jeopardize the current rating.

moat rating is 3 / 5
