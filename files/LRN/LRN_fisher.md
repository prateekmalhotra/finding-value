Stride, Inc. (LRN), August 21, 2025, Primary sources reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K for FY2024 and 10-Q for Q1-Q3 2025), and Q4 2024 to Q3 2025 earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride operates in the large and growing online education market, serving students from kindergarten through high school, as well as offering adult learning and career development programs. The demand for flexible and personalized learning options has been increasing. Stride's 2024 10-K reports revenues of $1.8 billion, a 9.7% increase from 2023, indicating continued growth. The company is also expanding its career learning programs, a segment with significant growth potential as the demand for vocational and skills-based training rises.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's management has a stated focus on expanding its services, particularly in career learning. The company has made strategic acquisitions to bolster its capabilities in this area, such as the acquisition of MedCerts and Tech Elevator. In their Q3 2025 earnings call, management reiterated their commitment to investing in new programs and technologies to meet the evolving needs of students and adult learners.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837025005882/lrn-20250331x10q.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LRN/transcripts/']

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride does not explicitly report R&D spending as a separate line item in its financial statements. Instead, these costs are embedded within "Instructional costs and services" and "Selling, general, and administrative expenses". This lack of transparency makes it difficult to quantitatively assess the effectiveness of their R&D efforts in relation to the company's size. While the company discusses innovation in its reports, without specific data on R&D spending and its direct outcomes, a definitive "Yes" cannot be supported.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's sales and marketing efforts are primarily focused on student acquisition and retention. The company's enrollment numbers have shown consistent growth, which suggests an effective sales and marketing function. For the fiscal year 2024, total enrollment grew by 3.2% to 184,600. The company utilizes a multi-channel marketing approach, including online advertising, social media, and community outreach. However, without specific data on metrics such as customer acquisition cost (CAC) or win rates against competitors, it is difficult to definitively classify their sales organization as "above-average."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, Stride reported a gross margin of 34.1% and an operating margin of 9.2%. These margins have been relatively stable over the past few years. While these margins are not exceptionally high, they are reasonable for the education services industry. The company has demonstrated the ability to generate consistent profits, with net income of $124.6 million in fiscal 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride is focused on several initiatives to improve its profit margins. These include leveraging its scale to achieve greater operating efficiencies, optimizing its marketing spend, and growing its higher-margin career learning business. In their Q3 2025 earnings call, management discussed their efforts to control costs and enhance profitability through technology-driven solutions and process improvements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LRN/transcripts/']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's 10-K mentions that its employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement. While the company emphasizes its commitment to creating a positive work environment, there is limited publicly available data to definitively assess the state of its labor and personnel relations. Without specific metrics on employee turnover, engagement scores, or independent assessments, it is difficult to give a confident "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Stride appears to be stable, with several key leaders having been with the company for a number of years. The CEO, James Rhyu, has been in his role since 2021. There is no public evidence of significant discord or turnover at the executive level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's investor relations website and 10-K filing list a number of experienced executives in key roles beyond the CEO, including a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and leaders for its various business segments. This suggests a reasonable depth of management. The company has also been actively hiring for key positions to support its growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, and the company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting in recent years. The company provides a detailed breakdown of its costs and expenses in its financial statements, which suggests a good handle on its cost structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the online education industry, key differentiators include the quality of the curriculum, the effectiveness of the learning platform, and relationships with school districts and other partners. Stride has been in the business for over 20 years and has developed a strong brand and a broad network of partner schools. The company's ability to offer a wide range of programs, including career learning, gives it a competitive edge over smaller, more specialized providers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in earnings calls and investor presentations suggests a focus on long-term growth. They consistently highlight their investments in new programs and technologies, even when these investments may not have an immediate payoff. The company's expansion into the career learning market is a prime example of its long-range focus.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LRN/transcripts/']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Stride had a strong balance sheet with $412.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and minimal debt. The company generates positive cash flow from operations, which provides it with the financial flexibility to fund its growth initiatives without needing to raise additional equity. The company also has a share repurchase program in place, which further reduces the risk of dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837025005882/lrn-20250331x10q.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Stride's management team regularly hosts earnings calls and participates in investor conferences. A review of their earnings call transcripts indicates a willingness to discuss both the positive and negative aspects of their business. They provide detailed explanations for their financial results and are generally responsive to questions from analysts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LRN/transcripts/']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no public information to suggest that Stride's management has been involved in any major scandals or controversies. The company has a code of conduct and ethics that all employees and directors are expected to follow. The "Legal Proceedings" section of their 10-K does not disclose any material litigation that would call into question the integrity of the management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1157408/000155837024011134/lrn-20240630x10k.htm']

---
Synthesis: Stride, Inc. scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market opportunity, financial strength, and management quality. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the growing demand for online and career-based learning. The primary areas of weakness in this analysis are the lack of transparency around R&D spending and the difficulty in definitively assessing the company's sales organization and labor relations from publicly available information. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company were to provide more granular data on its R&D investments and their outcomes, as well as more metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of its sales and marketing efforts. Any negative developments in the regulatory landscape for online education or increased competition could negatively impact the score.

fisher score is 12 / 15
