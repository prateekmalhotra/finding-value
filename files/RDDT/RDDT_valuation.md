### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | **Y1: 50%**, **Y2: 40%**, **Y3: 30%**, **Y4: 25%**, **Y5: 20%**. Starting with growth rates informed by strong Q2 results (78%) and Q3 guidance (~55%), then decelerating as the base grows larger. |
| **EBIT Margin** | **20% expanding to 28% over 5 years.** The TTM EBIT margin is ~8%, but management's 35% Adj. EBITDA guidance implies significant operating leverage. The forecast assumes margins expand toward a level more typical of mature platform businesses. |
| **Tax Rate** | **0% for Y1-Y2, 21% thereafter.** The company has significant Net Operating Losses ($590M Federal as of YE24) that will shield it from cash taxes in the near term. The rate phases in to the U.S. statutory rate. |
| **D&A (% of Revenue)** | **1.0%**. Based on the TTM average of 1.0% ($16.0M / $1,668M). |
| **SBC (% of Revenue)** | **18%**. Slightly below the TTM average of 20% ($334.4M / $1,668M), assuming some scale efficiencies. |
| **Capex (% of Revenue)** | **0.5%**. Based on the negligible TTM average of 0.2% ($3.7M / $1,668M), rounded up for conservatism. |
| **Δ NWC (% of Δ Revenue)** | **-8.0%**. Based on the TTM average (Change in WC of -$126.4M / Revenue growth of $693M). |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash available to all capital providers.
**FCFF Formula:** `EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,502 | $3,503 | $4,554 | $5,692 | $6,831 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *50.0%* | *40.0%* | *30.0%* | *25.0%* | *20.0%* |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale / Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.33% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. (Trading Economics, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Beta (β) | 2.30 | Reflects high volatility relative to the market since its IPO. (Barchart.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.50% | Standard assumption for a developed market like the U.S. |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **16.98%** | Formula: `Rf + β * ERP` => `4.33% + 2.30 * 5.50%` |
| Cost of Debt (Kd) | 5.00% | Proxy based on corporate bond yields; debt is immaterial. |
| Tax Rate | 21% | Long-term statutory rate. |
| Market Cap (E) | $41,070M | (Robinhood, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Debt (D) | $25M | (StockAnalysis, Balance Sheet, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **WACC** | **16.97%** | Formula: `(E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-t)` |

### **F) Terminal Value**

1.  **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (Assumed long-run inflation rate).
    *   Formula: `(FCFF_Y5 * (1+g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   Calculation: `($406M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1697 - 0.025)` = **$2,869M**

2.  **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Y5 EBIT + Y5 D&A = $1,913M + $68M = $1,981M.
    *   Assumed Exit Multiple: 15.0x (Median for Social Media sector). (Cogent Valuation, Sep 30, 2022)
    *   Formula: `Y5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple`
    *   Calculation: `$1,981M * 15.0` = **$29,715M**

*Decision:* The Gordon Growth method yields a significantly more conservative Terminal Value. To maintain a realistic, evidence-grounded valuation, the lower value of **$2,869M** is selected.

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Fair Value Per Share | Inputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **$19.08** | As calculated above. |
| **Low / Bear Case** | **$13.50** | Slower Revenue Growth (40% -> 15%), lower terminal EBIT margin (25%), 13x exit multiple. |
| **High / Bull Case** | **$25.50** | Faster Revenue Growth (60% -> 25%), higher terminal EBIT margin (30%), 17x exit multiple. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$13.36** | Formula: `Base Case * (1 - 0.30)` |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Dependence on Advertising Market:** A vast majority of revenue is from advertising, making the company highly susceptible to fluctuations in global ad spend and economic cycles.
2.  **Competition for Attention:** Reddit competes with larger, more capitalized platforms like Google, Meta, and TikTok for user attention and engagement, which are critical for ad inventory growth.
3.  **Content Moderation Challenges:** The user-moderated model presents unique risks. Controversial content or inconsistent moderation can damage the brand's reputation with both users and advertisers.
4.  **Valuation Volatility:** The high beta (2.30) indicates significant stock price volatility. The valuation is highly sensitive to long-term growth and margin assumptions, which are subject to considerable uncertainty given the company's recent profitability.
5.  **Monetization of User Base:** While user growth is strong, future revenue acceleration depends on successfully increasing the Average Revenue Per User (ARPU), especially in international markets where monetization is lower.
