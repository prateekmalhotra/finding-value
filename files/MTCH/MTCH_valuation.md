**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market's implied expectations, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is configured to match the current enterprise value.

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (Standard assumption for a mature market)
    *   Beta: 1.36 (Source: FINVIZ.com, reflecting higher volatility than the market average, justifiable for a technology company facing competitive pressures)
    *   **Cost of Equity:** 4.25% + 1.36 \* 5.0% = **11.05%**
    *   **Cost of Debt:** $147M / $3,515M = 4.18% (pre-tax). After-tax (21% rate): 4.18% \* (1 - 0.21) = **3.30%**
    *   Market Cap: $37.56 \* 271M shares = $10,179M
    *   Enterprise Value: $10,179M + $3,515M - $335M = $13,359M
    *   **WACC:** (10,179 / 13,694) \* 11.05% + (3,515 / 13,694) \* 3.30% = **9.08%**

*   **Terminal Value Assumptions:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (`g`): 2.5% (in line with long-term inflation expectations)

**3-5) Market-Implied Growth and Margin Assumptions**

By holding the TTM operating margin (24.1%) and capital intensity ratios constant, an iterative DCF calculation reveals the revenue growth rate required to justify the current stock price of $37.56.

**To justify today's stock price, the market is pricing in a 5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.5% while maintaining an operating margin of ~24%.** This implies a belief that Match Group can re-accelerate growth from its recent low-single-digit performance and sustain high profitability despite competitive pressures.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

This section builds a valuation based on independent, realistic assumptions grounded in the company's filings, management commentary, and industry dynamics.

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6-11) Base-Case Assumptions & Rationale**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **6.5% tapering to 4.5%** | This is slightly more optimistic than the original conservative case. It assumes Hinge's strong momentum continues and new Tinder product initiatives gain some traction, offsetting declines in other brands. The taper reflects the law of large numbers and a maturing market. This represents a more balanced view between recent performance and management's growth ambitions. |
| **Operating Margin** | **24.5% expanding to 26.0%** | The TTM margin is 24.1%. The assumption of a flat margin was too conservative. As a mature software-centric business, Match should realize operating leverage. This model assumes initial margin of 24.5% in Year 1, expanding by 0.5% annually to 26.0% in Year 5, reflecting the successful execution of management's "enterprise-wide initiatives to decrease operating costs." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call) |
| **Tax Rate** | **22.0%** | The effective tax rate for FY 2024 was 22%. (FY 2024 10-K) This remains a reasonable forward-looking rate. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.5%** | TTM Capex is ~1.4%. The FY 2025 guidance projects capex between $45M-$50M. (Q2 2025 Earnings Transcript) A stable 1.5% of revenue is a sound, slightly conservative assumption for this asset-light business model. |
| **Change in NWC (% of Revenue Change)**| **-2.0%** | As a subscription business, deferred revenue is a key component of working capital, making it a typical source of cash. Assuming NWC contributes cash equivalent to 2% of the change in revenue is a realistic middle ground. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **7.5%** | TTM SBC is 7.9%. Assuming a slight moderation to a stable 7.5% reflects a balance between the need to retain talent with equity and a renewed focus on cost discipline. It remains a significant non-cash expense treated as a real economic cost. |
| **Annual Share Count Reduction** | **-2.0%** | With a new $1.5B share repurchase authorization and stated intent to return capital to shareholders (FY 2024 10-K), a net 2.0% annual reduction in shares outstanding is a justified assumption, reflecting buybacks offsetting SBC dilution. |

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Forecast**
*   **Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD, in millions) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,675 | $3,896 | $4,111 | $4,316 | $4,511 |
| *Growth Rate* | *6.5%* | *6.0%* | *5.5%* | *5.0%* | *4.5%* |
| *Operating Margin* | *24.5%* | *25.0%* | *25.5%* | *26.0%* | *26.0%* |
| EBIT | $901 | $974 | $1,048 | $1,122 | $1,173 |
| Tax on EBIT (22.0%) | ($198) | ($214) | ($231) | ($247) | ($258) |
| **NOPAT** | **$703** | **$760** | **$818** | **$875** | **$915** |
| D&A (3.7% of Rev) | $136 | $144 | $152 | $160 | $167 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($276) | ($292) | ($308) | ($324) | ($338) |
| Capex | ($55) | ($58) | ($62) | ($65) | ($68) |
| Change in NWC | $4 | $4 | $4 | $4 | $4 |
| **FCFF** | **$512** | **$558** | **$604** | **$650** | **$680** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

The WACC is calculated as 9.08% as detailed in Part 1. This rate is used to discount the future free cash flows.

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Gordon Growth Method (Cross-Check)**
*   **Formula:** TV = FCFF\_(Y6) / (WACC - g)
*   FCFF\_(Y6) = $680M \* (1 + 2.5%) = $697M
*   **Terminal Value (GGM):** $697M / (9.08% - 2.50%) = **$10,593M**

**18) Exit Multiple Method (Primary Method)**
The original model's 10.0x exit multiple was at the low end of a reasonable range. A multiple that better reflects Match Group's market-leading position, strong brand portfolio (Tinder, Hinge), and high-margin profile is more appropriate.
*   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT ($1,173M) + D&A ($167M) = **$1,340M**
*   A multiple of **11.0x EV/EBITDA** is a more realistic base-case assumption for a mature, profitable consumer technology leader. This is not overly aggressive but gives credit to the business quality.
*   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple):** $1,340M \* 11.0 = **$14,740M**
*   The GGM TV implies an exit multiple of $10,593M / $1,340M = **7.9x**, which remains too low for a company of this caliber, confirming that the Exit Multiple Method is more appropriate here. We will proceed with the $14,740M value.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19-20) Enterprise & Equity Value Calculation**
*   PV of Explicit FCFF = ($512/1.0908¹) + ($558/1.0908²) + ($604/1.0908³) + ($650/1.0908⁴) + ($680/1.0908⁵) = $2,323M
*   PV of Terminal Value = $14,740M / (1.0908⁵) = $9,518M
*   **Enterprise Value:** $2,323M + $9,518M = **$11,841M**
*   Net Debt = Total Debt ($3,515M) - Cash ($335M) = $3,180M
*   **Equity Value:** $11,841M - $3,180M = **$8,661M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**
*   Initial Diluted Shares: 271M
*   Projected Year 5 Shares (with 2.0% annual reduction) = 271M \* (1 - 0.02)⁵ = **245M shares**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $8,661M / 245M shares = $35.35**

**22) Valuation Range**
*   **Base Case: $35.35.** Assumes moderate growth re-acceleration, steady margin expansion, and a realistic terminal multiple.
*   **Low/Bear Case: ~$24.** Assumes slower growth (3% tapering to 2.5%), margin stagnation at 23%, and a lower 9.0x exit multiple due to competitive pressures eroding profitability.
*   **High/Bull Case: ~$49.** Assumes the market's implied growth of 7.5% is achieved, margins expand to 27.5%, and a higher 12.5x exit multiple is warranted by superior execution and innovation.

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**
*   A 30% margin of safety from the base-case estimate is appropriate given the competitive and evolving nature of the online dating industry.
*   **MOS Price:** $35.35 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$24.75**

**Risk Notes**
1.  **Competitive Intensity:** Match Group faces intense competition from platforms like Bumble and evolving social media apps (Facebook Dating, etc.). Hinge's success cannibalizes Tinder's user base, and failure to innovate on its core Tinder asset could lead to market share loss.
2.  **Execution Risk:** The company is undergoing platform consolidations and cost-saving initiatives. Any disruption from these changes could negatively impact user experience and financial performance. The success of new product initiatives, particularly at Tinder, is critical for returning the brand to growth.
3.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The company is subject to ongoing legal and regulatory challenges globally, including antitrust concerns and data privacy regulations like GDPR. (FY 2024 10-K) Adverse rulings or new legislation could result in significant fines and require costly changes to business practices.
4.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** Consumer discretionary spending is sensitive to economic downturns. A recession could reduce users' willingness to pay for premium subscriptions or à la carte features, negatively impacting revenue.
5.  **Debt Burden:** The company holds a significant amount of debt ($3.5B). While manageable, this leverage could constrain financial flexibility in a downturn or a rising interest rate environment.

final answer is 35.35 $
