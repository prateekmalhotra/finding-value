*   **Beta:** 1.2 (Slightly above market average to reflect tech sector volatility).
*   **Cost of Equity:** 4.25% + 1.2 \* 6.0% = 11.45%
*   **Cost of Debt:** 3.5% (inferred from interest expense and total debt).
*   **WACC:** (0.95 \* 11.45%) + (0.05 \* 3.5% \* (1 - 0.171)) = 10.88% + 0.14% = 11.02%

### **F) Terminal Value**

### **I) Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Increased antitrust and data privacy regulations could impact business practices and lead to significant fines.
2.  **Competition:** Intense competition in all segments, especially in AI and cloud computing, could pressure margins and growth.
3.  **Advertising Market Sensitivity:** A significant portion of revenue is tied to the cyclical advertising market, which is sensitive to macroeconomic conditions.
4.  **Execution Risk on AI investments**: There is significant execution risk in monetizing large AI investments, and the path to profitability for some of these ventures is not yet clear.
5.  **Geopolitical Risk**: The company's global operations are subject to geopolitical risks, which could disrupt supply chains and impact international revenues.
