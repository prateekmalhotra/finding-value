**1) Network Effects**
*   **Reasoning:** Shoe Carnival exhibits minimal network effects. The value proposition for a customer does not meaningfully increase with the addition of new customers. While the Shoe Perks loyalty program has a large member base, it is a traditional loyalty program and does not create a user-to-user network.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Shoe Perks membership grew to 36.8 million members in Fiscal 2024, an increase of 7% from Fiscal 2023. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
    *   Purchases from Shoe Perks members were approximately 73% of comparable stores Net Sales in Fiscal 2024. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 1 / 5

**2) Switching Costs**
*   **Reasoning:** Switching costs for Shoe Carnival customers are virtually non-existent. Customers can easily switch to a competitor with no financial or data-related lock-in. The Shoe Perks loyalty program creates a minor incentive to remain, but the benefits are not significant enough to create a meaningful switching barrier.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The retail footwear business is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 1 / 5

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
*   **Reasoning:** Shoe Carnival likely has some cost advantages due to its scale and centralized distribution, but there is no direct evidence of a sustainable per-unit cost advantage over peers. The company's gross profit margin has been above 35% for four consecutive years, suggesting some pricing power or cost control, but it faces intense competition.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Gross Profit margin was 35.6% in Fiscal 2024. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
    *   The Evansville distribution center is a 410,000 square foot facility that can support up to 470 stores. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 2 / 5

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
*   **Reasoning:** Shoe Carnival owns several trademarks, including Shoe Carnival®, Shoe Station®, and Rogan's Shoes®. However, the brand does not appear to command a significant price premium over competitors. The in-store experience is a key differentiator, but it is not a protected intangible asset.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Owns federally registered trademarks including Shoe Carnival®, Shoe Station®, and Rogan's Shoes®. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 2 / 5

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
*   **Reasoning:** Shoe Carnival's distribution network of 430 stores across 36 states and Puerto Rico, supported by a large centralized distribution center, provides a degree of efficient scale. The company's omnichannel strategy, including ship-from-store capabilities, leverages this physical footprint.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   As of February 1, 2025, the company operated 430 stores in 36 states and Puerto Rico. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
    *   The Evansville distribution center can support up to 470 stores, with the potential to expand to support 650 stores. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 3 / 5

**6) Data Advantage**
*   **Reasoning:** The company's CRM program and 36.8 million Shoe Perks members provide a substantial amount of customer data. This data is used for personalized marketing and merchandising, but there is no evidence of a unique, hard-to-replicate dataset that creates a strong competitive advantage.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Shoe Perks membership grew to 36.8 million members in Fiscal 2024. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
    *   The CRM program provides insights into customer shopping habits, allowing for segmented communication and tailored merchandise mix at the individual store level. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 2 / 5

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
*   **Reasoning:** Shoe Carnival does not operate an ecosystem or platform business model. It is a traditional retailer and does not have third-party developers, a complementary product marketplace, or other ecosystem components.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The company's business model is described as a retail-focused business model. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 0 / 5

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
*   **Reasoning:** The retail footwear industry has no significant regulatory or legal barriers to entry. Shoe Carnival does not benefit from any licenses, patents, or other regulatory protections that would limit competition.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The retail footwear business is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 0 / 5

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
*   **Reasoning:** While the retail business requires capital for inventory and store build-outs, the assets are not highly specialized. The company leases all of its stores, which reduces capital intensity. A new entrant would not face prohibitive sunk costs to compete.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   All of the company's 430 stores are leased. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
    *   Capital expenditures for Fiscal 2025 are expected to be between $45 million and $60 million. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 2 / 5

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
*   **Reasoning:** As a retailer, Shoe Carnival has no long-term customer contracts, and revenue is transactional. The Shoe Perks loyalty program provides some visibility into the behavior of repeat customers, but this does not constitute recurring revenue.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The company's revenue is generated from the sale of footwear and accessories to customers. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
*   **Score:** 1 / 5

**Aggregation:**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (1 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (0 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 1.47
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 47.7 / 100

**Mapping:**
*   The weighted score of 47.7 falls within the 30 ≤ Weighted < 50 range, which maps to a moat rating of 2.

**Moat Duration Justification:**
The estimated moat duration is approximately 5-7 years. The company's primary competitive advantages are its established brand recognition, physical store footprint, and customer loyalty program. However, these advantages are not insurmountable and are susceptible to erosion from competition and changing consumer preferences.

**Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios:**
1.  **Increased competition from online retailers:** The continued growth of e-commerce could erode the value of Shoe Carnival's physical store network.
2.  **Loss of key vendor relationships:** The company is dependent on key brands like Nike, Skechers, and Crocs. A deterioration of these relationships could significantly impact its product assortment and sales. (10-K, February 1, 2025).
3.  **Failure of the Shoe Station rebannering strategy:** The company is investing heavily in converting Shoe Carnival stores to the Shoe Station banner. If this strategy fails to deliver the expected returns, it could weaken the company's financial position and competitive standing. (10-K, February 1, 2025).

**KPIs to Monitor:**
*   Comparable store sales growth
*   Gross profit margin
*   Shoe Perks membership growth and engagement
*   E-commerce sales as a percentage of total sales
*   Inventory turnover
*   Performance of rebannered Shoe Station stores
*   Market share in key regions
*   Customer traffic trends

**Short Verdict Paragraph:**
Shoe Carnival has a narrow moat based on its brand recognition, physical retail footprint, and customer loyalty program. However, the company operates in a highly competitive industry with low barriers to entry and minimal switching costs. The moat is susceptible to erosion from online competition and changes in vendor relationships. The success of the Shoe Station rebannering strategy is a key factor that could either strengthen or weaken the company's competitive position in the coming years. An increase in comparable store sales and gross margins would indicate a strengthening of the moat, while a decline in these metrics would suggest erosion.

moat rating is 2 / 5
