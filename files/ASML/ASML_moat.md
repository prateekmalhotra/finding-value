The total weighted score is 87.1.

### Mapping
**Weighted Score to Moat Rating**:
A weighted score of 87.1 is >= 85, which corresponds to a moat rating of 5.

### Moat Duration Justification
The durability of ASML's moat is estimated to be greater than 15 years. This is based on the company's sole supplier status for EUV lithography, the extremely high switching costs for customers, and the deep and protected intellectual property portfolio. The long R&D cycle in the semiconductor industry and the massive capital investment required to compete mean that any potential challenger would face a multi-decade effort to replicate ASML's capabilities.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Technological Disruption**: A new, non-lithographic technology for semiconductor manufacturing could emerge, making ASML's current product portfolio obsolete. (Inference)
2.  **Geopolitical Instability**: Increased trade restrictions or conflict could disrupt ASML's global supply chain and access to key markets. (ASML 2024 Annual Report, March 5, 2025)
3.  **Loss of Key IP**: A significant breach of ASML's intellectual property could allow a competitor to accelerate their development and challenge ASML's technological leadership. (Inference)

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **R&D spending as a percentage of revenue**: A decrease could signal a weakening commitment to innovation.
*   **Gross Margins**: A significant decline could indicate increased competition or pricing pressure.
*   **EUV system backlog and bookings**: A slowdown in orders could be an early indicator of a shift in technology or demand.
*   **Market share in the lithography market**: Any loss of market share would be a direct threat to the moat.
*   **Patent portfolio size and quality**: A slowdown in patent applications or the expiration of key patents could weaken the IP barrier.
*   **Customer concentration**: Over-reliance on a few large customers could increase risk.
*   **Installed Base Management revenue growth**: Slowing growth could indicate a decline in customer loyalty or an increase in competition in the services market.
*   **Emergence of competing technologies**: Any news or research on alternative semiconductor manufacturing technologies should be closely monitored.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
ASML's moat rating of 5/5 is justified by its monopoly position in the critical EUV lithography market, which is essential for the production of advanced semiconductors. This is supported by extremely high switching costs, a vast and protected intellectual property portfolio, and the immense capital investment required to compete. While the company faces risks from potential technological disruption and geopolitical instability, the durability of its competitive advantages is expected to persist for well over a decade. A significant and sustained decline in R&D investment, a drop in gross margins, or the emergence of a viable alternative to EUV lithography would be required to reconsider this strong moat rating.

moat rating is 5 / 5
