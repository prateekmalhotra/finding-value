**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

The discussion of challenges, such as supply chain disruptions and the discontinuation of a private label relationship, in the 2024 10-K suggests a good level of transparency with investors.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**,

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

### Synthesis
The Vita Coco Company scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating a strong market position, a commitment to innovation, and a sound financial footing. The company's main strengths lie in its dominant brand, its flexible asset-light supply chain, and its status as a purpose-driven company. The primary areas for improvement are in providing more transparency around its R&D effectiveness and demonstrating greater management depth with a clear succession plan. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of its new product launches, its ability to continue to gain market share in the growing coconut water category, and its success in expanding its international business. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosure on R&D spending and its impact on revenue, while a "No" on management depth could be addressed with a clear articulation of the company's succession plan.

### fisher score is 13 / 15
