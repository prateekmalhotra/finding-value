I am unable to complete the requested analysis of monday.com (MNDY). The reason for this is a persistent failure of the `browse` tool, which prevents me from accessing the necessary primary source documents such as SEC filings, earnings releases, and investor presentations. Without access to these documents, I cannot provide an evidence-first, fully transparent, and auditable analysis that meets the stringent requirements of your request.

Any attempt to proceed would rely on incomplete and unverified information, violating the core principles of the prompt. Therefore, I am unable to produce any of the requested sections of the report.
