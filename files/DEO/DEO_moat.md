| **Total**| **100%** | | **23.7** |

### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** As a producer and seller of consumer beverage alcohol, Diageo's business model does not benefit from network effects. The value of a Diageo product to a consumer does not increase as more people use it. There are no user-base metrics or network-based interactions that create a competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   There is no mention of network effects or related metrics in the primary financial filings. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for end consumers are virtually non-existent, as they can easily choose a competitor's product. For distributors and retailers, switching costs are low to moderate; while they have established relationships with Diageo, the primary barrier to switching is the consumer demand for Diageo's popular brands, not contractual or technical lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is based on sales to wholesalers and retailers, without significant contractual lock-in mentioned. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Diageo possesses a significant cost advantage derived from its massive scale in procurement, manufacturing, and marketing. This scale allows for superior efficiency and productivity savings, which helps offset cost inflation and fund brand investment. The company has a demonstrated track record of delivering substantial productivity benefits.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo achieved nearly $700 million in productivity savings in fiscal 2024, exceeding its three-year goal by $200 million. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
*   The company has a new target to deliver $2 billion in productivity savings over the next three years (fiscal 2025-2027). (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
*   Diageo's scale in advertising, data analytics, distribution, and manufacturing provides economies of scale that lead to lower average costs and higher margins.
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** This is Diageo's most powerful moat source. The company owns a portfolio of over 200 brands, including 13 billion-dollar brands with global recognition and deep heritage, such as Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, and Guinness. This brand equity allows for premium pricing and fosters strong consumer loyalty, creating a durable competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo possesses a portfolio of iconic brands, including Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Guinness, Don Julio, and Crown Royal, and holds number one global positions in scotch, vodka, tequila, and gin. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
*   Premium and above products account for 63% of net sales value, indicating strong pricing power.
*   Johnnie Walker is the world's #1 scotch brand by both value and volume, 3.5 times bigger than the nearest competitor by value.
**Score:** 5 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** Diageo has an unparalleled global distribution network, selling its products in nearly 180 countries. This extensive reach, built over decades, creates a significant barrier to entry for smaller competitors and is a key competitive advantage. Retailers and distributors are incentivized to partner with Diageo due to the high demand for its brands and its reliable supply chain.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo's products are sold in nearly 180 countries, with a global footprint that drives resilient growth across North America (39% of net sales), Europe (24%), Asia Pacific (19%), Latin America and Caribbean (9%), and Africa (9%). (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
*   Diageo is the #1 player in International Spirits by retail sales value globally, 1.4 times larger than its nearest competitor.
*   The company is making significant changes to its route-to-market in the US, its largest market, to further enhance execution and target high-growth areas. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 5 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** Diageo is increasingly using data analytics to inform its strategy, particularly in revenue growth management and marketing. While this is an advantage, it is not yet a deep, proprietary moat. The company is investing in digital capabilities to better understand consumer motivations and make more effective pricing and marketing decisions.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo leverages investments in digital, technology, and data analytics to make pricing decisions by market at a brand level.
*   The company is rolling out a proprietary Consumer Choice Framework to gain a deeper understanding of consumer motivations and occasions. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Diageo's business model is a traditional consumer goods model and does not have an ecosystem or platform structure. It does not rely on third-party developers or a complementary product marketplace to enhance the value of its core offerings.
**Evidence:**
*   The annual report does not describe any platform or ecosystem strategy. The business model is focused on sourcing, innovating, making, transporting, and marketing its own beverage brands. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The beverage alcohol industry is highly regulated globally, creating inherent barriers to entry. Diageo's scale and experience in navigating complex licensing, marketing, and distribution regulations in nearly 180 countries provide a moderate advantage over new entrants who would face significant compliance hurdles.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo's operations are subject to a wide range of regulations, including those related to production, distribution, and marketing of alcoholic beverages, which are described throughout its filings. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
*   Diageo's global footprint across nearly 180 countries implies a deep understanding and capability in managing diverse and complex regulatory environments. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The production of spirits, particularly aged whiskies, is a capital-intensive process requiring significant investment in distilleries, maturation warehouses, and inventory. Diageo's 132 production sites and billions of dollars in maturing stock represent a substantial sunk cost and long lead time that would be difficult for new entrants to replicate at scale.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo's capital expenditure (capex) was approximately $1.4-$1.5 billion per annum from fiscal 22-24, driven by capacity increases. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
*   The company held $7.8 billion of maturing inventories at the end of fiscal 2024, the majority of which is scotch that may be held for periods ranging from three to over 70 years. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** As a fast-moving consumer goods company, Diageo does not rely on long-term customer contracts for revenue visibility. Revenue is driven by purchase orders from a vast network of distributors and retailers, which are in turn driven by fluctuating consumer demand. This results in low revenue visibility compared to a subscription or long-term contract-based business.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is based on sales to wholesalers and distributors with no mention of long-term, recurring revenue contracts. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **Aggregation**

**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (5 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.15 + 0.60 + 0.60 + 0.50 + 0.20 + 0 + 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.02 = 2.37

The raw weighted score is 2.37. To get the score out of 100, we multiply by 20.
Weighted Score = 2.37 * 20 = **47.4 / 100**

### **Mapping**

A weighted score of 47.4 falls into the 30 ≤ Weighted < 50 range.
*   Weighted ≥ 85 → moat rating = 5
*   70 ≤ Weighted < 85 → moat rating = 4
*   50 ≤ Weighted < 70 → moat rating = 3
*   **30 ≤ Weighted < 50 → moat rating = 2**
*   10 ≤ Weighted < 30 → moat rating = 1
*   Weighted < 10 → moat rating = 0

*Correction*: The weighted contribution calculation needs to be based on a 0-100 scale from the start for clarity, as per the framework.
Recalculating with weights as percentages:
(0 * 18) + (1 * 15) + (4 * 15) + (5 * 12) + (5 * 10) + (2 * 10) + (0 * 8) + (3 * 6) + (3 * 4) + (1 * 2) = 0 + 15 + 60 + 60 + 50 + 20 + 0 + 18 + 12 + 2 = **237**.
This is incorrect. Let's recalculate the weighted score properly.

(0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (5 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.15 + 0.60 + 0.60 + 0.50 + 0.20 + 0 + 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.02 = 2.37.
Final score = 2.37 * 20 = 47.4.

Mapping again: **47.4 maps to a moat rating of 2.**

However, on review, the scores for several key dimensions (Cost Advantage, Intangible Assets, Distribution) are very high (4 and 5). It is unusual for such strong individual moat sources to result in a low final rating. Let me re-evaluate the scores and reasoning. The framework appears to heavily weight Network Effects and Switching Costs, which are irrelevant for this industry. This may be a flaw in applying the generic framework. The instructions state: "if industry-specific rationale requires different weights, explicitly justify any deviations." I will proceed with the default weights as instructed but note this discrepancy in the verdict.

Let's re-examine the scores:
*   Intangible Assets: 5 - Correct. Brand portfolio is elite.
*   Distribution: 5 - Correct. Global reach is a massive barrier.
*   Cost Advantage: 4 - Correct. Scale economies are evident.
*   Regulatory: 3 - Correct. Significant barrier but not unique to Diageo.
*   Capital Intensity: 3 - Correct. High sunk costs in distilleries/inventory.
*   Switching Costs: 1 - Correct. Low for consumers, moderate for distributors due to brand pull.
*   Data: 2 - Seems reasonable. They are investing but it's not a core advantage yet.
*   Network/Ecosystem/Contracts: 0/0/1 - Correct. Not applicable to the business model.

The calculation is correct based on the assigned scores and default weights. The low final score is a direct result of the high weighting (18% + 15% = 33%) on Network Effects and Switching Costs, where Diageo is inherently weak due to its industry. A more appropriate weighting would significantly down-weight these and up-weight Intangibles and Distribution. However, sticking to the user's provided framework:

**Weighted Score Recalculation (showing steps clearly)**
*   Network Effects: 0 * 18 = 0
*   Switching Costs: 1 * 15 = 15
*   Cost Advantage: 4 * 15 = 60
*   Intangible Assets: 5 * 12 = 60
*   Distribution: 5 * 10 = 50
*   Data Advantage: 2 * 10 = 20
*   Ecosystem: 0 * 8 = 0
*   Regulatory: 3 * 6 = 18
*   Capital Intensity: 3 * 4 = 12
*   Customer Contracts: 1 * 2 = 2
*   **Total Score:** 0 + 15 + 60 + 60 + 50 + 20 + 0 + 18 + 12 + 2 = **237**.

Wait, the weighted score cannot be 237. The calculation should be `Sum(score_dim * weight_dim)`. The score is 0-5, the weight is a percentage. The final score is on a scale of 0-100.
Let's try again: `Sum((score/5) * weight_percentage)`.
(0/5 * 18) + (1/5 * 15) + (4/5 * 15) + (5/5 * 12) + (5/5 * 10) + (2/5 * 10) + (0/5 * 8) + (3/5 * 6) + (3/5 * 4) + (1/5 * 2) =
0 + (0.2 * 15) + (0.8 * 15) + (1 * 12) + (1 * 10) + (0.4 * 10) + 0 + (0.6 * 6) + (0.6 * 4) + (0.2 * 2) =
0 + 3 + 12 + 12 + 10 + 4 + 0 + 3.6 + 2.4 + 0.4 = **47.4 / 100**.

This calculation seems correct. The score of 47.4 maps to a **2 / 5 rating**. I will state this but also address the weighting issue in the verdict.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The durability of Diageo's moat is primarily tied to its intangible brand assets and its vast, efficient distribution network. These advantages have been built over many decades and are difficult to erode. Brand loyalty in the spirits category is strong, and the global logistics required to compete at Diageo's scale would take a new entrant more than a decade to replicate. The moat is estimated to be durable for at least 10-15 years. (Diageo Annual Report 2024, July 24, 2024)

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Shift in Consumer Tastes:** A significant and rapid consumer shift away from established spirits brands towards new categories (e.g., craft spirits, non-alcoholic alternatives) where Diageo's portfolio is less dominant could erode its brand-based moat.
2.  **Regulatory Changes:** The introduction of prohibitive marketing restrictions, significant excise tax increases, or other adverse regulations in key markets like the United States could diminish Diageo's ability to leverage its brand strength and scale.
3.  **Distribution Disruption:** A major disruption in its global logistics network or a strategic shift by key distributors to favor competing brands could weaken Diageo's distribution advantage, although this is unlikely given the demand for its products.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Organic Net Sales Growth:** Sustained growth below the industry average would indicate an erosion of brand preference.
*   **Market Share:** Monitor share in key categories (Scotch, Tequila, Gin) and markets (US, Europe). A consistent loss of share in more than 30% of measured markets would be a red flag. (Diageo Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, February 4, 2025)
*   **Premium+ Mix:** A decline in the percentage of sales from premium and super-premium brands would signal weakening pricing power.
*   **Gross Margin vs. Peers:** A narrowing of the gross margin gap with its closest competitors (e.g., Pernod Ricard) could indicate a loss of cost advantage.
*   **Brand Investment (A&P as % of Sales):** A need to significantly increase marketing spend to maintain market share could suggest declining brand equity.
*   **Productivity Savings:** Failure to meet or exceed its stated productivity targets (e.g., $2 billion over FY25-27) would suggest its scale advantage is diminishing.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** A sustained decline in ROIC would suggest capital is being allocated less efficiently.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Diageo possesses a formidable competitive moat rooted in two primary sources: its portfolio of world-renowned intangible brand assets and its unparalleled global distribution scale. These advantages allow the company to command premium pricing and operate with significant cost efficiencies. However, under the provided analytic framework, the company's moat rating is constrained by the heavy weighting assigned to Network Effects and Switching Costs, dimensions where a consumer staples company is naturally disadvantaged. While the calculated score results in a moderate rating, a qualitative assessment focused on the most relevant industry factors would suggest a wider moat. A sustained decline in market share in its core spirits categories or a significant negative regulatory shift in its key markets would be the most likely evidence to challenge this assessment.

moat rating is 2 / 5
