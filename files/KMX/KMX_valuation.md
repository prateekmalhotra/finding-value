### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**
The following assumptions will drive the 5-year forecast.

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **4.0% per year.** This is a conservative estimate reflecting recent performance (TTM growth of 3.55%, Q1 FY26 growth of 6%) and management's guidance to "grow sales." | TTM Financials, Management Guidance |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin** | **3.00% of Revenue.** This aligns with the most recent TTM performance and is an improvement over the prior three fiscal years, justified by management's commentary on cost discipline. | TTM Financials, Management Guidance |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **25.0%.** This is consistent with the TTM rate of 25.12% and the average of the last three fiscal years. | TTM Financials |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.75% of Revenue.** Based on the TTM capex ($500.8M) as a percentage of TTM revenue ($28,673M). | TTM Financials |
| **D&A as % of Revenue**| **1.06% of Revenue.** Based on TTM D&A ($305.3M) as a percentage of TTM revenue ($28,673M). | TTM Financials |
| **SBC as % of Revenue**| **0.47% of Revenue.** Based on TTM SBC ($133.6M) as a percentage of TTM revenue ($28,673M). | TTM Financials |
| **Change in NWC** | **1.0% of incremental revenue.** Assumes a modest investment in net working capital is required for growth, a more conservative assumption than the negative (cash source) TTM figure. | TTM Financials |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (Figures in Millions USD) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $29,820 | $30,013 | $32,253 | $33,543 | $34,885 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* |
| EBIT | $895 | $930 | $968 | $1,006 | $1,047 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *3.00%* | *3.00%* | *3.00%* | *3.00%* | *3.00%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-Tax)) | $671 | $698 | $726 | $755 | $785 |
| (+) D&A | $316 | $329 | $342 | $356 | $370 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $140 | $146 | $152 | $158 | $164 |
| (-) Capital Expenditures | $522 | $543 | $565 | $587 | $610 |
| (-) Change in NWC | $11 | $12 | $12 | $13 | $13 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$314** | **$326** | **$339** | **$353** | **$368** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard assumption for a mature market)
    *   **Beta (Î²):** 1.36 (5-Year Beta). This reflects a higher-than-average market risk, which is appropriate for a cyclical, capital-intensive retailer.
    *   *Calculation: 4.29% + 1.36 * 5.0% = **11.09%***

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt:** 5.15% (Yield on BBB-rated corporate bonds, August 18, 2025). Used as an estimate due to KMX having no public credit rating.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt:** 5.15% * (1 - 25.0%) = **3.86%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Cap (Equity):** $8,961 million ($57.81/share * 155.0M shares)
    *   **Value of Debt:** $19,487 million
    *   **WACC:** ( ($8,961 / $28,448) * 11.09% ) + ( ($19,487 / $28,448) * 3.86% ) = **6.13%**

### **F) Terminal Value**
*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a reasonable long-term assumption, in line with expected long-run inflation.
    *   **Terminal Value:** (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   *Calculation: ($368 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0613 - 0.025) = $377 / 0.0363 = **$10,386 million***

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT ($1,047M) + D&A ($370M) = $1,417M
    *   **Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple:** $10,386M (Terminal Value) / $1,417M (Year 5 EBITDA) = **7.3x**. This multiple is plausible for a mature specialty retailer and serves as a reasonable cross-check.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| (Figures in Millions USD) | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) | $1,444 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $7,716 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$9,160** |
| (-) Total Debt | $19,487 |
| (+) Cash & Equivalents | $263 |
| *Net Debt* | *$19,224* |
| **Equity Value** | **($10,064)** |

The calculation results in a negative Equity Value. This occurs because the company's large debt balance ($19.5B) is significantly greater than the calculated present value of its future cash flows ($9.2B) under these base-case assumptions. A negative equity value implies that the company's operating assets, as valued by this DCF, are insufficient to cover its debt obligations.

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** **$0.00**
    *   *Given the negative Equity Value, the intrinsic value per share is calculated as zero, as shareholders' equity would be wiped out in a scenario where the company is valued solely on its ability to generate this level of future cash flow against its current debt.*

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $0.00
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** $0.00. Plausible inputs include a lower growth rate (e.g., 1-2%) and margin compression due to competition, which would result in an even lower enterprise value and thus still a negative equity value.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** To achieve a positive equity value, CarMax would need to generate significantly higher cash flows. For instance, achieving a sustained 5% revenue growth and a 4% EBIT margin would be required to push the enterprise value above the net debt load. This would result in a positive, albeit low, per-share value.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% margin of safety to a $0.00 base case value still results in a **$0.00** MOS price.

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **High Leverage:** The company's substantial debt ($19.5B) is the primary driver of the negative equity valuation. The enterprise value is not sufficient to cover these liabilities, posing a significant risk to equity holders.
2.  **Margin Sensitivity:** The valuation is highly sensitive to operating margin assumptions. The 3.00% TTM margin is an improvement over recent years; a reversion to the 2.4%-2.8% range would further decrease the calculated enterprise value.
3.  **Cyclical Demand:** The used car market is highly cyclical and sensitive to interest rates and consumer credit conditions. A downturn could negatively impact revenue growth and profitability, invalidating the forecast.
4.  **Competitive Pressure:** The used car market is intensely competitive. Increased pressure from online retailers and traditional dealerships could compress margins and market share.
5.  **Interest Rate Risk:** A significant portion of CarMax's business model is tied to its financing arm (CAF). Rising interest rates can decrease consumer demand and increase the cost of funds for the company.

final answer is 0.00 $
