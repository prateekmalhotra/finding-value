### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Y1: -2.0%, Y2: 2.0%, Y3: 4.0%, Y4: 6.0%, Y5: 6.0% | Based on current headwinds (7% Q2 organic decline) and lowered guidance, a near-term decline is projected, followed by a gradual recovery toward historical norms, consistent with management's commentary on a 2026 recovery. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 14.0% | Due to lack of specific guidance, the average of the last three full fiscal years (FY22, FY23, FY24) is used: (18.1% + 16.5% + 12.2%)/3 = 15.6%. This is adjusted down to 14.0% to reflect the recent margin compression seen in the TTM period (10.1%) and the challenging market. |
| **Tax Rate** | 26.0% | Based on the average effective tax rate of the last three full fiscal years, excluding the anomalous TTM rate: (28.1% + 21.6% + 28.7%)/3 ≈ 26.1%. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | 6.0% | Based on the 3-year historical average (FY22-FY24). |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 0.8% | Based on the 3-year historical average (FY22-FY24). |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 3.5% | Based on the 3-year historical average (FY22-FY24). |
| **Change in WC as % of Δ Revenue**| 25.0% | Based on the historical relationship between working capital changes and revenue changes. |

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in millions USD) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,374.1 | $3,441.6 | $3,579.3 | $3,794.1 | $4,021.7 |
| EBIT (14.0% of Rev) | $472.4 | $481.8 | $501.1 | $531.2 | $563.0 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 0.74) | $349.6 | $356.6 | $370.8 | $393.1 | $416.7 |
| **(+)** D&A (6.0% of Rev) | $202.5 | $206.5 | $214.8 | $227.6 | $241.3 |
| **(-)** SBC (0.8% of Rev) | $27.0 | $27.5 | $28.6 | $30.4 | $32.2 |
| **(-)** Capex (3.5% of Rev) | $118.1 | $120.5 | $125.3 | $132.8 | $140.8 |
| **(-)** Δ in WC | ($17.2) | $16.9 | $34.4 | $53.7 | $56.9 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$424.2** | **$398.2** | **$397.3** | **$403.8** | **$428.1** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

| Component | Value | Calculation & Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | `Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium` |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.31% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (YCharts, August 20, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard market assumption for a mature market. |
| Beta (5-Year) | 1.16 | Sourced from Finbox and MarketBeat, reflecting higher volatility than the market average, which is reasonable for a company in a specialized, high-tech industry. |
| **Cost of Equity** | **9.97%** | `4.31% + 1.16 * 5.00%` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost of Debt** | | `Interest Expense / Total Debt` |
| Interest Expense | $56.0M | (stockanalysis.com, TTM ended June 30, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $2,478.0M | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| **Cost of Debt** | **2.26%** | `$56.0M / $2,478.0M` |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 1.67% | `2.26% * (1 - 26.0%)` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **WACC** | | `(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-t))` |
| Equity Market Value (E) | $5,158M | `152.0M shares * $33.94/share` (August 20, 2025) |
| Debt Market Value (D) | $2,478M | Book value used as a proxy. |
| Total Value (V) | $7,636M | `E + D` |
| **WACC** | **7.51%** | `(5158/7636 * 9.97%) + (2478/7636 * 1.67%)` |

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Method:** Gordon Growth Model
*   **Rationale:** Assumes the company will grow at a stable rate indefinitely.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a conservative rate, in line with long-term inflation expectations and sustainable long-term GDP growth.
*   **Calculation:** `Terminal Value = (FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   Terminal Value = ($428.1 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0751 - 0.025)
    *   **Terminal Value = $8,771.6 million**

*   **Cross-Check (Exit Multiple):**
    *   Y5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $563.0M + $241.3M = $804.3M
    *   Implied Exit Multiple = $8,771.6M / $804.3M = **10.9x EBITDA**. This is a reasonable multiple for a stable company in this sector.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   ($424.2 / 1.0751^1) + ($398.2 / 1.0751^2) + ($397.3 / 1.0751^3) + ($403.8 / 1.0751^4) + ($428.1 / 1.0751^5)
    *   = $394.6 + $344.4 + $319.2 + $301.6 + $298.0 = **$1,657.8 million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:**
    *   $8,771.6M / (1.0751^5) = **$6,104.9 million**
*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   `PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value`
    *   $1,657.8M + $6,104.9M = **$7,762.7 million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   `Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($2,478.0M) - Cash ($92.0M) = **$2,386.0 million**
    *   $7,762.7M - $2,386.0M = **$5,376.7 million**

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   `Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   $5,376.7M / 152.0M shares = **$35.37 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $35.37:** Assumes a near-term revenue dip followed by a gradual recovery and stable 14.0% operating margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$25:** This scenario assumes a deeper and more prolonged downturn, with revenue declining by 4-5% in Year 1 and only recovering to 3-4% growth. Margins compress further to 12.5%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$48:** This scenario assumes the current headwinds are transitory, with revenue growth quickly rebounding to 8-10% driven by new product cycles, and operating margins expanding to the historical peak of 17-18% due to successful cost-cutting.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value is applied for a margin of safety.
    *   MOS Price = $35.37 * (1 - 0.30) = **$24.76**

### Risk Notes

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** The company's performance is highly sensitive to the capital spending budgets of its customers in biopharma, industrial, and academic sectors. A global economic slowdown could further delay purchases.
2.  **Margin Pressure:** The TTM operating margin of 10.1% is significantly below the historical average. Failure to execute on the announced cost-saving initiatives could prevent margins from recovering to the 14.0% assumed in this model.
3.  **Integration Risk:** Bruker has historically grown through acquisitions. Future acquisitions carry integration risk and may not deliver the expected synergies, potentially impacting profitability.
4.  **Technological Obsolescence:** The company operates in a rapidly evolving high-tech instrumentation market. A failure to innovate and maintain a competitive edge could lead to market share loss.
5.  **Foreign Exchange Risk:** A significant portion of revenue and expense is generated outside the United States, exposing the company to volatility in currency exchange rates.

final answer is 35.37 $
