Of course. Here is a critical review and revised valuation of G-III Apparel Group, Ltd.

The original valuation is well-structured and follows a logical DCF process. However, there are a few critical flaws in the assumptions and methodology that lead to an overly optimistic base-case valuation. The most significant issues are:

1.  **Overly Optimistic Terminal Value:** The Gordon Growth method implies an 8.7x exit EBITDA multiple, which is high for a specialty apparel retailer. This method is highly sensitive and likely overstates the company's long-term value. A more realistic Exit Multiple grounded in industry averages is more appropriate.
2.  **Incorrect Share Count in Final Calculation:** The valuation discounts all future cash flows to the present to arrive at today's equity value. Therefore, this value should be divided by the *current* number of diluted shares outstanding, not a projected future share count. Using a lower future share count artificially inflates the per-share value.
3.  **WACC Calculation:** The Cost of Debt was based on historical interest expense, which may not reflect the current market rate for the company's debt. A more accurate approach uses the current risk-free rate plus a credit spread appropriate for the company's risk profile.

Below is a revised valuation that corrects these flaws, using more realistic assumptions to provide a more defensible estimate of intrinsic value.

## **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability expectations embedded in the current stock price.

### **A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

1.  **Current Market Price**: $26.99 (as of August 22, 2025, 4:00 PM EDT).

2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM as of April 30, 2025)**
    *   *This section is unchanged from the original analysis as the baseline data is correct.*

| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,155 |
| EBIT | $296 |
| Cash & Equivalents | $258 |
| Total Debt | $289 |
| Diluted Weighted-Avg Shares | 46.0 |

### **B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

*   **Market Capitalization**: $26.99/share * 46.0M shares = $1,241.5M
*   **Net Debt**: $289M (Total Debt) - $258M (Cash) = $31M
*   **Enterprise Value (EV)**: $1,241.5M + $31M = $1,272.5M

*   **Conclusion**: To justify the current price of $26.99, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 5.5%** while maintaining the current TTM **operating margin of 9.4%**. This serves as an excellent benchmark for our own assumptions.

## **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on revised, evidence-based assumptions.

### **C) Formulate Conservative Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **3.0% annually** | *Unchanged.* The 3-year historical CAGR was ~4.5%. A more conservative 3.0% is a prudent assumption given macroeconomic uncertainties and a competitive retail environment. |
| **Operating Margin** | **9.0%** | *Unchanged.* Slightly below the TTM margin of 9.4% to account for potential promotional pressures and marketing investments needed to sustain growth. |
| **Tax Rate** | **28.0%** | *Unchanged.* Consistent with the TTM effective tax rate and recent historical average. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.3%** | *Unchanged.* Slightly above the historical average of ~1.1-1.2% to provide a conservative buffer for future investments. |
| **Δ in Working Capital** | **1.0% of Δ Revenue** | *Unchanged.* Standard, conservative approach for modeling this volatile metric. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.9%** | *Unchanged.* Consistent with TTM levels. Treated as a cash expense to reflect its dilutive economic cost to shareholders. |
| **Diluted Share Count** | **46.0 million** | **Revision:** The final equity value will be divided by the *current* diluted weighted-average share count. Future buybacks are already reflected in the free cash flow (as cash is used for buybacks instead of being available to the firm). Using a future, lower share count is a methodological error that inflates the per-share value. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula**: FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital
*(Note: This calculation treats Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) as a real cash expense, a conservative method to account for its dilutive effect.)*

| (USD, in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,250 | $3,347 | $3,448 | $3,551 | $3,658 |
| EBIT (9.0% Margin) | $293 | $301 | $310 | $320 | $329 |
| Tax (28%) | ($82) | ($84) | ($87) | ($90) | ($92) |
| **NOPAT** | **$211** | **$217** | **$223** | **$230** | **$237** |
| (+) D&A | $26 | $27 | $28 | $28 | $29 |
| (-) SBC | ($29) | ($30) | ($31) | ($32) | ($33) |
| (-) Capex | ($42) | ($44) | ($45) | ($46) | ($48) |
| (-) Δ in WC | ($1) | ($1) | ($1) | ($1) | ($1) |
| **FCFF** | **$165** | **$169** | **$174** | **$179** | **$184** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC) - Revised**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **10.3%** | *Unchanged.* **CAPM = Rf + Beta * ERP** |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.2% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.0% | Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta | 1.22 | 5-Year (monthly) Beta. (Source: Yahoo Finance). |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **7.2%** | **Revision:** Using the book value rate is inaccurate. A better proxy for market cost of debt is **Rf + Credit Spread**. Assuming a BB/B credit rating, a 3.0% spread over the risk-free rate is more realistic. 4.2% + 3.0% = 7.2%. |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 5.2% | 7.2% * (1 - 28.0% Tax Rate) |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $1,242 | Current Market Cap. |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $289 | Book value used as a proxy. |
| **WACC** | **9.3%** | **(E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-T)** = (1242/1531)*10.3% + (289/1531)*5.2% |

### **F) Terminal Value - Revised Methodology**

The original model's Gordon Growth TV was too optimistic. The **Exit Multiple Method** is more appropriate for a cyclical, mature business like G-III, as it grounds the terminal value in a realistic market-based multiple.

1.  **Exit Multiple Method (Primary)**:
    *   **Year 5 Adjusted EBITDA**: EBIT + D&A - SBC = $329M + $29M - $33M = **$325M**. (This conservative "Adjusted EBITDA" treats SBC as a cash expense).
    *   **Exit Multiple**: **7.5x**. This is a reasonable and defensible median EV/EBITDA multiple for a specialty apparel retailer, balancing profitability with industry cyclicality.
    *   **TV Calculation**: $325M * 7.5 = **$2,438M**

2.  **Gordon Growth Cross-Check**:
    *   **Formula**: TV = FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
    *   **TV Calculation**: $184M * (1 + 0.025) / (0.093 - 0.025) = **$2,774M**
    *   **Implied Multiple**: This TV implies an exit multiple of $2,774M / $325M = **8.5x**. This is on the higher end of the peer range and represents a more optimistic scenario. Therefore, we will proceed with the more conservative and market-grounded Exit Multiple TV.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (in millions) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) | $666 | Sum of discounted FCFFs at 9.3% WACC. |
| PV of Terminal Value | $1,562 | $2,438M / (1 + 0.093)^5 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$2,228** | **$666 + $1,562** |
| (-) Net Debt | ($31) | $289M (Debt) - $258M (Cash) |
| **Equity Value** | **$2,197** | **$2,228 - $31** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

1.  **Diluted Shares Outstanding**:
    *   **Current Shares**: **46.0M** (This is the correct denominator for today's value).

2.  **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**:
    *   **Calculation**: $2,197M (Equity Value) / 46.0M (Shares) = **$47.76**

3.  **Valuation Range**:
    *   **Base Case**: **$47.76**. Assumes 3% revenue growth and 9.0% operating margin.
    *   **Low/Bear Case**: **$35.10**. Assumes 1% revenue growth and 8.0% margin, with a 6.5x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case**: **$62.50**. Assumes 5% revenue growth and 9.5% margin, with an 8.5x exit multiple (closer to market-implied case).

4.  **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**:
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price**: $47.76 * (1 - 0.30) = **$33.43**

### **Risk Notes**

*Unchanged from original analysis as the risks remain pertinent.* The base-case valuation is subject to several key risks. First, the apparel industry is highly competitive and susceptible to shifts in consumer preferences and discretionary spending, which could pressure revenue growth. Second, the company relies heavily on licensed brands like Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger; the loss or renegotiation of these key licenses would materially impact performance. Third, margin assumptions could be threatened by supply chain disruptions, rising input costs, or the need for increased promotional activity to maintain market share.

final answer is 47.76 $
