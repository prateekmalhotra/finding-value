### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow is expanding its services to create a "housing super app" that encompasses the entire real-estate lifecycle, including buying, selling, renting, and financing. This strategy significantly expands its Total Addressable Market (TAM). The company estimates its TAM to be approximately $168 billion, including residential real estate industry transaction fees ($82 billion), U.S. mortgage origination revenue ($45 billion), title and escrow services ($16 billion), rentals advertising spend ($16 billion), and property management software revenue ($9 billion). Zillow's increasing focus on its rentals marketplace and mortgage services, with mortgage revenue growing 51% year-over-year in 2024, diversifies its revenue streams beyond the cyclical for-sale market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow consistently invests in new product development and strategic acquisitions to enhance its ecosystem. The company is actively developing its "housing super app" to integrate various real estate services. Recent acquisitions like Follow Up Boss (a customer relationship management system for real estate professionals) and Aryeo (a real estate photography and media platform) demonstrate a commitment to providing a more seamless and digitized experience for both consumers and real estate professionals.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's research and development expenses were $543 million, $545 million and $495 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The company's focus on R&D has resulted in a strong brand and a leading market position. Zillow's Zestimate, a proprietary home valuation model, is a key differentiator that drives significant user engagement. The company's continued innovation in its "housing super app" and integration of AI and machine learning into its platform further demonstrate the effectiveness of its R&D efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's sales and marketing expenses increased by 20% to $790 million in 2024 from $658 million in 2023, primarily due to increased headcount-related expenses and marketing and advertising costs. This investment supports the growth of its Premier Agent program and other services. The Premier Agent program is a key revenue driver, and its success relies on an effective sales organization that can attract and retain real estate agents. The company's ability to consistently grow its residential revenue suggests an effective sales and marketing function.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's gross profit margin was 76% in 2024, a slight decrease from 78% in 2023. The company reported a net loss of $112 million in 2024, an improvement from a net loss of $158 million in 2023. While the company is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis, its gross margin is strong. The company's focus on higher-margin businesses like its rentals and mortgages segments, along with its efforts to control costs, should contribute to improved profitability in the future.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow is focused on improving its profit margins by shifting its revenue mix towards higher-margin businesses, such as its rentals and mortgage segments. The company is also investing in technology and automation to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs. For example, the use of AI and machine learning in its Zestimate and other products helps to automate processes and reduce the need for manual intervention. Additionally, the company is focused on cost discipline, with general and administrative expenses decreasing by 5% in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

Zillow also conducts pay equity analyses to ensure fair compensation. These factors contribute to a positive and productive work environment, which is essential for attracting and retaining top talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's founders, Rich Barton and Lloyd Frink, remain actively involved in the company as co-chairs of the board of directors. This provides a level of stability and long-term vision. The company has a well-defined management structure with a team of experienced executives. The company's capital structure, with a dual-class share structure, gives the founders significant voting control, which could be a concern for some investors but also ensures a consistent long-term strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow has a deep and experienced management team with a mix of long-tenured executives and newer hires with diverse backgrounds. The company has a clear succession plan, as evidenced by the recent promotion of Jeremy Wacksman to CEO. The company's 10-K filing lists a number of key executives beyond the CEO, including a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, and other senior leaders responsible for various aspects of the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's 10-K filing provides a detailed breakdown of its costs and expenses, allowing for a thorough analysis of its cost structure. The company's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which has issued an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. This suggests that the company has a strong system of accounting controls in place. The company's management's discussion and analysis section of the 10-K provides further insights into its cost management strategies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's key competitive advantage is its strong brand recognition and its "living database of homes," which includes its proprietary Zestimate. Zillow is the most visited real estate website in the United States, which creates a powerful network effect. The more users who visit the site, the more valuable it becomes for real estate agents and other professionals, which in turn attracts more users. The company's focus on creating a seamless, integrated transaction experience through its "housing super app" is another key differentiator that could provide a sustainable competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's management has consistently communicated a long-term vision for the company, focused on building a "housing super app" that will generate sustainable growth and profitability over the long run. The company has a history of investing heavily in new products and services, even at the expense of short-term profitability. This is evidenced by its ongoing investments in its rentals and mortgage businesses, as well as its acquisitions of companies like Follow Up Boss and Aryeo. While the company is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis, its focus on long-term growth and market leadership suggests a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Zillow had $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. The company also generated $428 million in cash flow from operations in 2024. This strong liquidity position provides the company with the flexibility to fund its growth initiatives without having to resort to dilutive equity financing. While the company has used equity in the past for acquisitions, its strong cash position and operating cash flow reduce the risk of significant dilution for existing shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Zillow's management maintains a regular and open dialogue with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor presentations, and SEC filings. The company's 10-K filing provides a detailed discussion of the risks and challenges facing the business, including the impact of macroeconomic factors on the housing market and competition. The company's decision to wind down its iBuying business, Zillow Offers, was communicated transparently to investors, with management providing a clear rationale for the decision.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence to suggest that Zillow's management has questionable integrity. The company has a strong corporate governance framework, with a board of directors that includes independent directors. The company's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, and the company has a history of complying with all applicable laws and regulations. While the company has been involved in some legal proceedings, this is not uncommon for a company of its size and scope.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1617640/000161764025000016/z-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:** Zillow Group presents a compelling growth story, with a strong brand, a large and expanding addressable market, and a clear long-term vision. The company's "housing super app" strategy has the potential to create a powerful network effect and generate sustainable growth and profitability over the long run. The company's strong financial position, experienced management team, and commitment to innovation are all positive factors. However, the company is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis, and its success will depend on its ability to execute on its strategy and navigate the cyclical nature of the housing market. The biggest variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to achieve GAAP profitability, the successful integration of its recent acquisitions, and the continued growth of its rentals and mortgage businesses.
