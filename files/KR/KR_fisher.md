Company: The Kroger Co. (KR)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K (filed April 1, 2025, for FY ending Feb 1, 2025), Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (June 20, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kroger's growth runway extends beyond traditional grocery sales. The company is driving significant growth through its digital ecosystem, which saw e-commerce sales grow 15% in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Its alternative profit businesses, particularly the Kroger Precision Marketing retail media network, leverage shopper data to create high-margin revenue streams, which grew 17% in 2024. Furthermore, the *Our Brands* private label portfolio, with over $32 billion in 2024 sales, continues to offer room for growth through premiumization and product innovation.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment is demonstrated by its consistent capital allocation. In fiscal 2024, Kroger's capital investments totaled $3.6 billion, focused on enhancing the customer experience, improving efficiency, and developing technology. The company is expanding its automated fulfillment network in partnership with Ocado and plans to complete 30 major store projects in 2025 with an acceleration of new store openings beyond that. The Q1 2025 earnings call emphasized a focus on driving growth through fresh products, e-commerce, and pharmacy services, indicating a clear strategy for future development.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a retailer, Kroger does not have a traditional R&D budget. Its innovation spending is categorized under capital expenditures and focuses on technology, data analytics, and process improvement. While its data analytics subsidiary, 84.51°, is highly effective at personalization, and its partnership with Ocado for automated fulfillment centers is a significant process innovation, the effectiveness relative to peers like Walmart and Amazon with their massive technology budgets is difficult to prove as "outstanding." The company is effectively applying technology, but it is not a technology leader in a way that provides a distinct, durable advantage across the entire business.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kroger's sales "organization" is its sophisticated data-driven personalization and loyalty program. With approximately 63 million households served annually and over 95% of transactions linked to a loyalty card, Kroger possesses deep customer insights. This data fuels its personalization efforts and its retail media business, creating a feedback loop that drives customer engagement and sales. The consistent growth in digitally-engaged customers and a 3.2% increase in identical sales (excluding fuel) in Q1 2025 demonstrates the effectiveness of this data-led sales strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025), ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHLE7nq8wfPwjkIC4jEAi6MtkCnANhtTVMUlNbO4JgpupZJE9OCe2zaLILKmKMYvWXxh8om5y23czlO4iL6v9H_Qb89mmoRwEF9KGZlrotTD_A3IafH_yb0Ko8m-d3ORNzOSFSyEkjixSk1gn1XmWwwd_UDQoMqnpM0FGzl196b4-yXPhRoROBMKMErEOlWuTAFuXewgJwW7bzXsKVSowqS'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHLE7nq8wfPwjkIC4jEAi6MtkCnANhtTVMUlNbO4JgpupZJE9OCe2zaLILKmKMYvWXxh8om5y23czlO4iL6v9H_Qb89mmoRwEF9KGZlrotTD_A3IafH_yb0Ko8m-d3ORNzOSFSyEkjixSk1gn1XmWwwd_UDQoMqnpM0FGzl196b4-yXPhRoROBMKMErEOlWuTAFuXewgJwW7bzXsKVSowqS) (June 20, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The grocery industry is characterized by thin margins, and Kroger is no exception. For its 2024 fiscal year, Kroger's gross margin was 22.26% and its operating profit margin was 2.62%. This compares unfavorably on a gross margin basis to its largest competitor, Walmart, which reported a gross margin of 24.9% in its latest twelve months. While Kroger is profitable, its margins are not high enough to be considered a significant competitive advantage or "worthwhile" by Fisher's standards, which favor companies with uniquely high profitability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025), ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHnLkKTR6f6IT3OXQxJAnxjBbdIh4mFGtSbNa5fHuKaLP0Y1E4NKQji-ZGtZSmWodmrxTX6BHEVKLF9rioGWVBNedik4lDEYSncoJbgPhMlHJW7KB4x35t3F_2Ucx9UM5pmBjkgouLyHB2J'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHnLkKTR6f6IT3OXQxJAnxjBbdIh4mFGtSbNa5fHuKaLP0Y1E4NKQji-ZGtZSmWodmrxTX6BHEVKLF9rioGWVBNedik4lDEYSncoJbgPhMlHJW7KB4x35t3F_2Ucx9UM5pmBjkgouLyHB2J) (August 24, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kroger is actively focused on margin improvement through multiple initiatives. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company's FIFO gross margin rate increased by 79 basis points, driven by strong performance in its *Our Brands* portfolio and cost-saving initiatives. The company's "Value Creation Model" is centered on growing its high-margin alternative profit businesses, like retail media, and using those profits to reinvest in the core business. The company also continues to pursue "broad-based cost savings initiatives that drive administrative efficiencies, including store productivity."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGKxV0XJ41LcMvAUfHSyF4KTtsPDtglI2_gs1fPY2Z8K6NuhmLOzsPLO79KJP5Z8oVbvUq_NqTUBJpKkKsGHTPg38FqmhyTr63SB7N8hjpuMjo0PG1MbjakCvGP7bCoDqM8B3clSG6961VaoC_RWcEBjwejTopcz4-FZQTUWDGll8MuwZ09Py_ZnLHYDNp32hbv_2-rdOJmGNXqqWMd-3w_8ItIkf-uC-hh1qTRSXTFV4xzwz3-'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGKxV0XJ41LcMvAUfHSyF4KTtsPDtglI2_gs1fPY2Z8K6NuhmLOzsPLO79KJP5Z8oVbvUq_NqTUBJpKkKsGHTPg38FqmhyTr63SB7N8hjpuMjo0PG1MbjakCvGP7bCoDqM8B3clSG6961VaoC_RWcEBjwejTopcz4-FZQTUWDGll8MuwZ09Py_ZnLHYDNp32hbv_2-rdOJmGNXqqWMd-3w_8ItIkf-uC-hh1qTRSXTFV4xzwz3-) (June 20, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** With approximately 409,000 employees, 64% of whom are covered by collective bargaining agreements, labor relations are a constant focus. The company has invested over $2.7 billion in incremental wages over the last five years. While some negotiations are successful, such as the February 2024 agreement in Houston that secured pensions and lowered healthcare costs, others are more contentious. As of July 2025, workers in Central Indiana had rejected two tentative agreements, and a large number of contracts are expiring in 2025, suggesting ongoing friction. This mixed environment does not meet the high bar of "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company appointed Ronald L. Sargent as Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board in March 2025. While Mr. Sargent has been a director since 2006, the need for an interim CEO suggests a lack of a ready internal successor for the top role, indicating a potential weakness in succession planning. This recent turnover at the highest level of the company prevents a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the interim CEO, Kroger's executive team demonstrates considerable depth and experience. Key leaders like Mary Adcock (EVP and Chief Merchant), Yael Cosset (EVP and Chief Digital Officer), and Timothy Massa (EVP and Chief People Officer) have long tenures and have been promoted through various leadership roles within the company. This reflects a strong bench of operational talent with deep institutional knowledge.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. Furthermore, Item 9A of the 10-K states that management has concluded the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There is no history of major restatements or identified material weaknesses, indicating robust and reliable accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kroger possesses a unique combination of assets that are difficult for competitors to replicate. Its vertically integrated private label business (*Our Brands*) is a key differentiator, generating over $32 billion in sales and fostering customer loyalty. The company’s exclusive data analytics subsidiary, 84.51°, leverages loyalty card data from over 95% of transactions to personalize the customer experience at a scale few can match. Finally, its strategic partnership with Ocado for large-scale, automated customer fulfillment centers provides a distinct capability in the growing online grocery market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management explicitly articulates a long-range strategy in its 2024 10-K, called the "Value Creation Model." This model uses the cash flow from high-margin alternative profit businesses to "reinvest back into our retail business" to enhance customer experience and drive loyalty. This willingness to reinvest profits from new ventures into the core business, rather than maximizing short-term earnings, is a hallmark of a long-range profit outlook. The consistent capital investments in technology and stores, even in a competitive environment, further supports this conclusion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong. It generated $5.8 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2024 and maintains a leverage ratio of 1.69x net total debt to adjusted EBITDA as of Q1 2025, well below its target range ceiling of 2.50x. Instead of issuing shares, Kroger is actively retiring them, having repurchased $4.2 billion of its common stock in 2024. This demonstrates a robust capacity to fund growth through internal cash flow and debt without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/56873/000155837025004267/kr-20250201x10k.htm) (April 1, 2025), ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHLE7nq8wfPwjkIC4jEAi6MtkCnANhtTVMUlNbO4JgpupZJE9OCe2zaLILKmKMYvWXxh8om5y23czlO4iL6v9H_Qb89mmoRwEF9KGZlrotTD_A3IafH_yb0Ko8m-d3ORNzOSFSyEkjixSk1gn1XmWwwd_UDQoMqnpM0FGzl196b4-yXPhRoROBMKMErEOlWuTAFuXewgJwW7bzXsKVSowqS'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHLE7nq8wfPwjkIC4jEAi6MtkCnANhtTVMUlNbO4JgpupZJE9OCe2zaLILKmKMYvWXxh8om5y23czlO4iL6v9H_Qb89mmoRwEF9KGZlrotTD_A3IafH_yb0Ko8m-d3ORNzOSFSyEkjixSk1gn1XmWwwd_UDQoMqnpM0FGzl196b4-yXPhRoROBMKMErEOlWuTAFuXewgJwW7bzXsKVSowqS) (June 20, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its communications. The Risk Factors section of the 10-K is detailed and transparent about challenges, including competition, labor relations, and data security. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, executives acknowledged areas for improvement, stating, "Volume improvement remains a key priority for us, and we expect sequential improvement throughout the year," and "We still have a lot of work to do." This willingness to openly discuss both strengths and weaknesses indicates a culture of transparency.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's integrity is not "unquestionable." Kroger is a defendant in numerous lawsuits related to the distribution of opioids and has recorded significant settlement charges, totaling over $1.4 billion. While this is an industry-wide issue, the scale of the matter is significant. Violation Tracker also shows a history of penalties for various offenses, including employment discrimination and Controlled Substances Act violations. These legal and regulatory issues, particularly the opioid settlement, prevent a conclusion of unquestionable integrity.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**

Kroger presents as a strong, mature business effectively navigating a highly competitive, low-margin industry. Its primary strengths lie in its powerful, data-driven sales and marketing engine and its long-range strategic vision, which leverages new, high-margin businesses to reinvest in its core grocery operations. The company's financial health is excellent, with strong cash flow and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. However, the analysis identified weaknesses in key areas for a Fisher-style investment. These include a lack of "outstanding" profit margins relative to peers, contentious labor relations in some regions, recent instability at the CEO level, and a significant blemish on its integrity from the nationwide opioid litigation.

The score could most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on three factors. First, the successful appointment of a permanent CEO with a clear vision could flip the "Executive Relations" point to Yes. Second, a successful resolution of the numerous major union contracts expiring in 2025 without significant work stoppages could improve the "Labor Relations" score, though reaching "outstanding" is a high bar. Finally, evidence that its technology and fulfillment investments are creating a quantifiable and widening margin advantage over peers would be needed to reconsider the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" and "R&D Effectiveness" answers.

fisher score is 9 / 15
