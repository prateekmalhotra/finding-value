### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The demand for healthcare professionals is expected to grow due to an aging U.S. population and a shortage of nurses and physicians. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects the need for an additional 194,500 new registered nurses each year on average through 2033. The Association of American Medical Colleges projects a physician shortage of up to 86,000 by 2036. Cross Country Healthcare's services directly address these long-term trends.

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a net loss, resulting in a negative operating margin of -1.25%. The gross margin for the same period was 20.41%. These margins are not indicative of a "worthwhile" profit margin, especially when compared to some peers who have positive operating margins.

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?

However, the company also disclosed the correction of an error to previously issued financial statements. While the auditor's opinion is positive, the restatement indicates a past weakness in controls.
**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the healthcare staffing industry is the ability to attract and retain qualified professionals. Cross Country Healthcare has been recognized as a leading healthcare staffing firm with a 3.5% market share in 2023. Their proprietary mobile on-demand staffing platform, XperienceTM, provides a world-class candidate experience with real-time matching to open positions, which is a significant differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141103/000162828025010519/ccrn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141103/000162828025010519/ccrn-20241231.htm) (March 5, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's focus on digital transformation and investment in technology, such as the Intellify® platform, indicates a long-range outlook. These investments are aimed at driving growth through better operational execution and enhanced productivity in the long run, even if they impact short-term profitability. The company also has a share repurchase program, which can be seen as a sign of management's confidence in the long-term value of the company.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141103/000162828025010519/ccrn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141103/000162828025010519/ccrn-20241231.htm) (March 5, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, the company had $80.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and no borrowings under its ABL facility. Operating cash flow is the primary source of liquidity. The company has an active share repurchase program, which reduces the number of outstanding shares, rather than diluting them. This suggests a strong financial position that does not necessitate equity financing for growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141103/000162828025023234/ccrn-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1141103/000162828025023234/ccrn-20250331.htm) (May 7, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Due to the pending acquisition by Aya Healthcare, Cross Country Healthcare has stopped holding earnings calls. While this is a common practice during a pending merger, it limits the direct communication and transparency with investors regarding the company's performance and challenges.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696956-cross-country-healthcare-at-this-price-the-pending-acquisition-is-worth-betting-on-rating-upgrade](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4696956-cross-country-healthcare-at-this-price-the-pending-acquisition-is-worth-betting-on-rating-upgrade) (June 30, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cross Country Healthcare states a commitment to integrity and the highest standards of ethical behavior. The company has established a governance hotline for stockholders to communicate with the Board of Directors. There are no recent reports of major scandals or integrity breaches. However, a 2015 article raised concerns about the company's use of "Adjusted EBITDA" and financial misrepresentations. While this is not a recent issue, it is a point to consider.
**Answer:** No

### Synthesis
Cross Country Healthcare exhibits strengths in its market position, commitment to technology, and employee relations. The company is well-positioned to benefit from long-term demographic trends driving demand for healthcare professionals. However, the pending acquisition by Aya Healthcare casts a shadow over the company's future as a standalone entity and has led to a lack of recent direct communication from management. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the outcome of the Aya Healthcare acquisition and a return to consistent profitability. A "No" on profit margins could be flipped to a "Yes" with sustained positive net income and operating margins. A "No" on candor with investors would flip to a "Yes" if the acquisition is terminated and the company resumes regular earnings calls and investor communications. The past issue regarding accounting controls and the use of adjusted metrics, though not recent, also warrants monitoring.
