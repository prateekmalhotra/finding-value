**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks continues to expand its global store base, opening 898 net new stores in the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, reaching a total of 41,097 stores globally. The company sees significant growth opportunities in both existing markets like the U.S. and higher-growth international markets. While recent comparable store sales have declined, the company is implementing a "Back to Starbucks" strategy to reinvigorate growth through enhanced customer experience, product innovation, and operational efficiency.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks has a stated objective to "drive beverage, equipment, process, and technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform." The company's "Back to Starbucks" strategy emphasizes reestablishing a leading position in coffee through product development, marketing, and an enhanced in-store experience. Recent earnings calls highlight a focus on new product offerings and simplifying store tasks to better engage with customers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SBUX/transcripts/' (2022-2025)]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks does not explicitly disclose R&D spending as a separate line item in its financial statements, making a direct peer comparison difficult. However, the company's innovation is embedded in its marketing and product development efforts, with a clear focus on beverage innovation as a core strategy. The effectiveness can be inferred from the retail sales mix, where beverages consistently account for 74% of revenue in company-operated stores from fiscal 2022 to 2024, indicating successful product offerings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks' sales organization is multi-faceted, including company-operated stores (82% of total net revenues in FY2024), licensed stores (12%), and a Channel Development segment (5%). A key strength is its digital platform, including the Starbucks Card and Starbucks® Rewards loyalty program, designed to increase visit frequency. The company continues to expand its digital relationships with customers through mobile ordering and payment systems, which are central to its growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, Starbucks reported an operating margin of 15.0%. However, for the quarter ended June 29, 2025, the operating margin contracted to 9.9% from 16.7% in the prior-year period, driven by deleverage and investments. While historically strong, recent pressure on margins is a concern, though they remain substantial.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins. The Q3 2025 earnings call mentions plans to enhance the coffeehouse experience while also reducing new store build costs and driving efficiency. The company is also implementing a new operating model, the "Green Apron Service model," to establish consistent and scalable standards across U.S. stores. Additionally, the company is evaluating its global store portfolio, which may result in restructuring charges aimed at long-term efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks faces significant challenges in labor relations. The company's FY2024 10-K acknowledges union organizing efforts and states that as of September 29, 2024, approximately 5% of its U.S. company-operated store partners are represented by unions. The "Risk Factors" section extensively discusses risks related to unionization, including potential for increased costs, decreased flexibility, and negative brand perception. These ongoing issues suggest that labor relations are not "outstanding" at this time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced recent high-level executive turnover. Brian Niccol was appointed chairman and chief executive officer in September 2024, following a transition period where the CFO, Rachel Ruggeri, served as interim CEO. While the current team is experienced, this level of change at the top introduces uncertainty and suggests executive relations have been strained.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks' FY2024 10-K lists a team of experienced executives beyond the CEO, including a CEO of Starbucks International, a Chief Partner Officer, and a Chief Legal Officer, all with long tenures at the company or extensive industry experience. The company also highlights its management development and succession planning practices as a key part of its human capital strategy, overseen by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the board.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks' FY2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024. Management's evaluation, as of the end of Q3 2025, concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The company provides detailed segment reporting, offering transparency into its cost structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the retail coffee industry is brand reputation and customer loyalty, which Starbucks has cultivated for decades. The company's global brand is one of its most valuable assets. Another clue is its real estate strategy, focusing on high-traffic, high-visibility locations and flexible store formats like drive-thrus to maximize convenience. Finally, the scale of its loyalty program and digital ecosystem creates a significant barrier to entry and a powerful marketing tool.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922424000057/sbux-20240929.htm' (November 20, 2024)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's new "Back to Starbucks" strategy involves significant near-term investments in partners, technology, and stores, which have negatively impacted short-term margins. For example, the Q3 2025 operating margin contracted significantly due to investments in a leadership conference and additional labor. This willingness to absorb near-term costs for a long-term strategic reset indicates a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks generates substantial cash flow from operations ($3.4 billion in the first three quarters of FY2025). The company has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases rather than issuing new equity for financing. While there were no share repurchases in the first three quarters of fiscal 2025, the company still had 29.8 million shares available for repurchase under its existing authorization as of June 29, 2025. Its access to debt markets remains strong, as evidenced by its $3.0 billion revolving credit facility.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In recent earnings calls, management has been direct about the company's challenges. In the Q3 2025 call, the CEO acknowledged continued progress on key initiatives but also noted ongoing "macroeconomic challenges." The company openly discusses issues like declining comparable store sales and margin pressures, and details the steps being taken to address them through the "Back to Starbucks" strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's FY2024 10-K and subsequent 10-Qs do not disclose any material legal proceedings that would suggest a lack of integrity at the executive level. The company's legal proceedings are noted as arising in the "ordinary course of business," with the risk of a material contingent loss from these matters deemed remote. While facing litigation related to labor practices, there is no evidence of widespread fraud or executive malfeasance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/829224/000082922425000058/sbux-20250629.htm' (July 23, 2025)]

**Synthesis:**

Starbucks scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its powerful brand, long-term growth potential, and commitment to innovation. The company's strong financial controls and candid communication with investors are also positives. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses in labor and executive relations, which are critical areas of concern. The recent CEO transition and ongoing unionization challenges have created uncertainty and represent the most significant risks to the business.

The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the execution of the "Back to Starbucks" strategy. A successful turnaround that restores positive comparable store sales growth and improves margins would be a major positive catalyst. Conversely, continued struggles with store traffic, coupled with escalating labor disputes, could lead to a further decline in the score. Flipping the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes" would require a significant and verifiable improvement in the company's relationship with its unionized and non-unionized partners, likely demonstrated through successfully negotiated contracts and a reduction in NLRB complaints. A period of stability and clear strategic execution from the new CEO would be needed to change the "No" on executive relations.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
