### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries is the world's largest manufacturer of towing and recovery equipment. The company's growth is tied to the replacement of existing tow trucks and wreckers, as well as overall global economic growth. The company has seen a significant increase in net sales, which grew from $777.8 million in 2022 to $1.18 billion in 2024. This growth has been driven by strategic acquisitions, such as the 2024 purchase of Southern Hydraulic Cylinder, Inc., and organic growth from new products. Miller Industries continues to innovate, introducing new products like the Century M100, which will contribute to future sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries has demonstrated a commitment to ongoing product development. In the first quarter of 2025, the company announced its first-ever rotator and heavy-duty wrecker combination, the Century M100. This new product is the result of significant investment in research and development and is expected to be a key driver of future growth.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Miller Industries does not disclose its research and development spending as a separate line item in its financial statements, the company's continuous introduction of new and updated products suggests an effective R&D process. The recent launch of the Century M100, a first-of-its-kind product, is a clear indicator of the company's innovative capabilities. However, without specific R&D spending figures, a direct comparison to competitors is difficult, preventing a definitive "Yes".
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries distributes its products through a global network of independent distributors. The company's sales have shown strong growth, increasing from $777.8 million in 2022 to over $1.18 billion in 2024. The company's ability to increase prices in response to inflation, without a significant drop in demand, suggests a strong market position and an effective sales strategy. This is further evidenced by the record revenue and profitability seen in recent quarters.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025002276/mlr-20241231x10k.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/MLR/transcripts/']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the first six months of 2025, Miller Industries reported a gross profit of $105.7 million and a gross margin of 14.9%. Net income for the same period was $42.2 million, resulting in a net profit margin of 6.0%. The company has been focused on improving its profitability, with gross margins improving by 340 basis points in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in the prior year. While the company's margins have improved, a comprehensive comparison with direct competitors is necessary to definitively say they are "worthwhile".
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025010540/mlr-20250630x10q.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/MLR/transcripts/']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries is actively working to improve its profit margins. The company has implemented price increases to offset inflationary pressures. Additionally, Miller Industries is focused on improving its operational efficiency by investing in new technologies and processes. The recent acquisition of Southern Hydraulic Cylinder is a strategic move to vertically integrate and reduce costs, which is expected to have a positive impact on margins.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no available public information to suggest any significant labor issues at Miller Industries. The company's 2024 10-K filing does not mention any labor disputes. However, without specific metrics on employee turnover, engagement, or safety, it is not possible to definitively assess the quality of the company's labor and personnel relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Miller Industries appears to be stable. William G. Miller, II, has been with the company since 1993 and has served as CEO since 2011. The core executive team has been in place for several years, which suggests a cohesive and stable leadership environment. However, without more information on succession planning and the board's relationship with management, a definitive "Yes" cannot be given.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025002276/mlr-20241231x10k.htm']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries' management team includes experienced professionals in key roles, such as the Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer, in addition to the CEO. However, the company's public disclosures do not provide detailed information about the management team beyond the named executive officers. Without further insight into the depth of management at the divisional or operational level, it is difficult to fully assess the company's management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025002276/mlr-20241231x10k.htm']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries' financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, and the company's 2024 10-K report includes a statement on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. The company provides a detailed breakdown of its costs and expenses in its financial statements, which suggests a good level of cost analysis. There is no evidence of any material weaknesses in the company's accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025002276/mlr-20241231x10k.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries' dominant market share as the world's largest manufacturer of towing and recovery equipment is a significant competitive advantage. This scale allows the company to invest more in research and development, leading to innovative products like the Century M100. Furthermore, the company's extensive distribution network provides a barrier to entry for potential competitors. The company's vertical integration through acquisitions like Southern Hydraulic Cylinder also gives it a competitive edge in managing costs and supply chain.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025002276/mlr-20241231x10k.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/MLR/transcripts/']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries' management team appears to be focused on long-term growth. The company's recent acquisition of Southern Hydraulic Cylinder and its continued investment in new product development, such as the Century M100, are indicative of a long-term strategic focus. While the company is also focused on near-term profitability, its actions suggest a willingness to make investments that will pay off over the long run.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025002276/mlr-20241231x10k.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/MLR/transcripts/']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Miller Industries had $55.4 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company also has a revolving credit facility that provides it with additional liquidity. While the company has taken on debt to fund its acquisition of Southern Hydraulic Cylinder, its debt-to-equity ratio remains manageable. The company has a history of funding its growth through a combination of cash flow from operations and debt, rather than through the issuance of equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025010540/mlr-20250630x10q.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Miller Industries holds regular conference calls with investors to discuss its financial results and business outlook. The company's management team appears to be transparent in its communications, providing detailed explanations for its performance and answering questions from analysts. There is no evidence to suggest that the company is not forthcoming with information, either positive or negative.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/MLR/transcripts/']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no public information to suggest that the management of Miller Industries lacks integrity. The company has no history of legal or regulatory issues, and its financial reporting appears to be transparent. The company's 2024 10-K report includes a code of ethics that applies to all of its employees, including its executive officers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/924822/000155837025002276/mlr-20241231x10k.htm']

---
Synthesis: Miller Industries scores well on many of Fisher's points, with strong market leadership, a commitment to innovation, and a solid financial position. The company's recent acquisition and new product introductions are likely to drive future growth. The primary areas where the score could be improved are in providing more detailed information about R&D spending, labor relations, and management depth. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness if the company were to disclose its R&D spending as a percentage of revenue and provide more detail on its product pipeline. Similarly, more disclosure on employee turnover and satisfaction metrics could change the score for labor relations.

fisher score is 11 / 15
