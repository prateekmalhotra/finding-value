### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Interactive Brokers operates a global, automated brokerage platform that continues to attract a growing number of sophisticated and active traders, hedge funds, and financial advisors. Customer accounts grew 19% year-over-year to 3.16 million as of June 30, 2025, with customer equity rising 30% to $503.7 billion. The company is continuously expanding its services into new geographic markets and enhancing its product suite, such as offering trading in a wider array of cryptocurrencies and expanding its securities financing capabilities, indicating a long runway for growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IBKR's corporate identity is rooted in technological innovation and continuous platform improvement. Management's commentary consistently focuses on development priorities. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, executives highlighted the ongoing rollout of new features for their trading platforms (TWS and IBKR Mobile), the expansion of their wealth management offerings, and the integration of advanced AI-powered tools for clients. This focus on in-house development of proprietary technology is a core tenet of their strategy, aimed at attracting more sophisticated users and increasing platform engagement.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Interactive Brokers does not break out R&D as a separate line item; it is embedded within "Technology and communications expenses." However, the firm's entire business model is a testament to its development effectiveness. Its lean, technology-driven approach allows it to operate with only 2,983 employees as of December 31, 2024, while serving a global, complex client base. The output of its development is the highly automated, low-cost platform itself, which generates industry-leading profit margins. This indicates that its R&D spending, whatever the absolute amount, is exceptionally productive relative to its size and revenue.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IBKR does not have a traditional sales organization. Its customer acquisition model relies primarily on low costs, a sophisticated product offering, and word-of-mouth, supplemented by digital marketing. The 2024 10-K states, "Our business has been built to be a low-cost and efficient servicing firm, not a marketing firm." While effective for its target audience, this strategy does not align with Fisher's concept of an above-average, proactive sales force that actively develops new markets and customer relationships. The lack of a large, dedicated sales team is a feature of their low-cost model, not a sign of a superior selling culture.
**Answer:** No

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Interactive Brokers consistently reports some of the highest profit margins in the financial services industry. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, the company reported income before tax of $1.87 billion on adjusted net revenues of $2.75 billion, for a pre-tax profit margin of approximately 68%. This extraordinarily high margin is a direct result of its highly automated business model, which creates significant operating leverage as revenue grows.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IBKR's primary method for maintaining and improving its already high margins is through continued automation and the leveraging of its fixed-cost base. The 2024 10-K emphasizes that their systems are built to be highly scalable, allowing them to increase client and transaction volumes with minimal additions to staff and fixed costs. By constantly refining their proprietary software and infrastructure, they drive operating leverage, which naturally expands margins as the business grows. There is no evidence of a need for special programs or restructuring; margin maintenance is embedded in their operating philosophy.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is insufficient public information to conclude that IBKR has "outstanding" labor relations. The company's filings note that it is "highly dependent on our talented team of software engineers, computer scientists and other professionals," but provide no specific metrics on employee turnover, engagement, or satisfaction. While there are no reports of significant labor disputes, the absence of negative evidence does not meet Fisher's high bar for a "Yes." Without positive, verifiable data on employee relations, the answer must be conservative.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Executive relations appear stable and aligned with shareholder interests. The founder, Thomas Peterffy, remains Chairman and the driving force behind the company's strategy, ensuring continuity. Milan Galik has served as CEO since 2019, indicating a successful leadership transition. Insider ownership is exceptionally high, with Mr. Peterffy and his affiliates controlling the majority of the voting power, which creates powerful alignment between management and the company's long-term success.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a lean management structure, with a small circle of key executives. While there has been a successful CEO transition from the founder to Milan Galik, the immense influence and control of Chairman Thomas Peterffy represents a significant key-person risk, as acknowledged in the company's 10-K. The public disclosures about management depth below the top executive level are limited. This heavy reliance on the founder, while a historical strength, fails to meet the criterion of deep management talent.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, publicly traded global broker-dealer, Interactive Brokers is subject to stringent accounting and regulatory oversight. The company's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. There is no history of significant financial restatements. The detailed segment and revenue disclosures in its filings suggest robust internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IBKR's key competitive advantage is its vertically integrated, proprietary technology stack. Unlike many competitors that rely on third-party vendors, IBKR built and maintains its entire trading, clearing, and back-office ecosystem. This provides two distinct advantages: an extremely low cost structure, which allows it to offer lower commissions and margin rates, and a high degree of flexibility to innovate and add new features rapidly. This technological moat is the central pillar of its competitive strength.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently prioritizes long-term platform development and market expansion over short-term earnings optimization. In earnings calls, Chairman Thomas Peterffy frequently discusses multi-year technology projects and strategic initiatives aimed at strengthening the company's competitive position decades from now. The company's history is one of continuous reinvestment into its technology platform, even when such investments do not have an immediate or predictable quarterly payoff.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong. It is highly profitable, generates substantial cash flow from operations, and maintains a large capital base well in excess of regulatory requirements. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $6.7 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends and has an active share repurchase program, indicating it is a net reducer, not issuer, of shares. There is no foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's management, and particularly its founder and Chairman Thomas Peterffy, are known for their direct and candid communication style. On quarterly earnings calls, Mr. Peterffy provides detailed, often unscripted, commentary on market structure, competitive threats, and the firm's strategic thinking. This transparency extends to discussing challenges and areas for improvement, providing investors with a clear view of management's perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IBKR/transcripts/ (July 16, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While there is no evidence of intentional malfeasance by senior management, the company has faced significant regulatory penalties. For instance, in 2020, its subsidiaries agreed to pay $38 million in penalties to resolve charges from the SEC, FINRA, and CFTC related to anti-money laundering (AML) compliance failures. As a large, global broker, it is subject to numerous legal and regulatory proceedings disclosed in its 10-K. The term "unquestionable" sets an extremely high bar that a history of significant regulatory fines, even if addressed, prevents the company from meeting.
**Answer:** No

---
**Synthesis:**

Interactive Brokers scores highly on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its dominant position as a technology-driven, low-cost global brokerage. The company's primary strengths are its outstanding, scalable technology platform, which provides a deep competitive moat and produces exceptionally high profit margins. This is complemented by a strong balance sheet, a long-range strategic outlook from its founder-led management, and transparent investor communications. The main weaknesses identified are a lack of a traditional sales force (a feature of its model, but a failure on Fisher's specific point), a high degree of key-person risk centered on its founder, and a regulatory record that, while not indicative of fraud, cannot be described as "unquestionable." The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two factors. First, continued growth in international markets and among institutional clients could further solidify its long runway. Second, a prolonged period without significant new regulatory actions could eventually strengthen the case for its integrity, potentially flipping a "No" to a "Yes."
