### B) Management Guidance Extraction

*   **Revenue:** While no explicit numerical guidance was provided, management commentary from the Q1 and Q2 2025 earnings calls indicate a focus on "high-quality growth," expansion into new categories like food delivery, and leveraging AI to improve efficiency. The Q2 2025 earnings release noted a 22.4% year-over-year revenue increase.
*   **Margins:** Management highlighted "a 12-quarter streak of year-on-year improvement" in gross margin in the Q1 2025 earnings call. The Q2 2025 release also noted an improvement in JD Retail's operating margin.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** No specific guidance was provided.

### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** A 15% growth rate is assumed for Year 1, tapering down to 5% by Year 5. This is a conservative estimate based on the recent strong growth, management's focus on quality growth, and the law of large numbers.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin of 2.7% is used as a baseline and is held constant throughout the forecast period. While management is focused on margin improvement, this is a conservative assumption.
*   **Taxes:** A 25% effective tax rate is assumed, in line with the statutory rate in China.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed to be 2.5% of revenue, in line with historical averages.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Assumed to be -1.5% of the change in revenue, reflecting the company's efficient working capital management.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** Assumed to be 0.4% of revenue.
    *   **Diluted Share Count:** The latest reported diluted weighted-average share count of 3,150 million is used.

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**FCFF Formula:**
FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (RMB millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 1,413,120 | 1,596,826 | 1,756,508 | 1,899,429 | 1,994,400 |
| EBIT | 38,154 | 43,114 | 47,426 | 51,285 | 53,849 |
| NOPAT | 28,616 | 32,336 | 35,569 | 38,463 | 40,387 |
| D&A | 14,131 | 15,968 | 17,565 | 18,994 | 19,944 |
| SBC | 5,652 | 6,387 | 7,026 | 7,598 | 7,978 |
| Capex | 35,328 | 39,921 | 43,913 | 47,486 | 49,860 |
| Change in WC | (2,765) | (3,518) | (2,382) | (2,166) | (1,422) |
| **FCFF** | **(478)** | **5,513** | **4,577** | **4,539** | **4,215** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-Year US Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (a standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.20 (Assumed, reflecting the risk profile of a large-cap Chinese tech company).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 1.20 * 5.0% = 10.29%**
*   **Cost of Debt:** 2.22% (Interest Expense / Average Debt)
*   **WACC:**
    *   Equity Weight = 83% (Market Cap / (Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash))
    *   Debt Weight = 17%
    *   **WACC = (0.83 * 10.29%) + (0.17 * 2.22% * (1 - 0.25)) = 8.82%**

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (in line with long-run inflation expectations).
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (4,215 * 1.025) / (0.0882 - 0.025) = 68,249 million RMB**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   A 5.0x EV/EBITDA multiple is assumed, which is a conservative estimate for a company with JD's market position.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 5.0 * 73,793 (Year 5 EBITDA) = 368,965 million RMB**
    *   The lower of the two terminal values, the Gordon Growth value, will be used for the base case.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = 2,828 million RMB
    *   PV of Terminal Value = 44,795 million RMB
    *   **Enterprise Value = 47,623 million RMB**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Enterprise Value - Net Debt (Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents)
    *   **Equity Value = 47,623 - (90,000 - 180,000) = 137,623 million RMB**

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **137,623 million RMB / 3,150 million shares = 43.69 RMB per share**
    *   **USD Equivalent (at 7.25 CNY/USD): $6.03**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($4.50):** Lower revenue growth (10% tapering to 3%), margin compression to 2.0%, and a higher WACC (10%).
    *   **High/Bull Case ($8.50):** Higher revenue growth (20% tapering to 7%), margin expansion to 3.5%, and a lower WACC (8%).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Base-Case):**
    *   **$4.22**

### Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include: 1) Intense competition in the Chinese e-commerce market, which could pressure growth and margins. 2) The evolving regulatory landscape in China, which could impact JD.com's operations and future growth prospects. 3) A slowdown in the Chinese economy, which would reduce consumer spending and demand for JD.com's products and services. 4) The company's ability to successfully execute on its new initiatives, such as the expansion into food delivery. 5) The inherent uncertainty in any financial forecast, particularly for a company in a dynamic and rapidly changing market.
