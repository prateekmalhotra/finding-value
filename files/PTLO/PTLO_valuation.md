Of course. The original valuation has several critical issues that lead to an unrealistically low, and potentially flawed, conclusion. The primary problems are an overly punitive discount rate, an unsustainable assumption about capital expenditures, and the resulting illogical terminal value calculation.

Here is a revised and corrected valuation analysis that addresses these flaws by incorporating more realistic, balanced assumptions about the company's transition from a high-growth phase to maturity.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are embedded in the current stock price. *(This section is logically sound and is retained from the original analysis for context.)*

**A) Current Market Price & Baseline Financials**

*   **Current Market Price:** **$7.29** (at close, August 22, 2025).

**Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months - TTM)**

| Metric | Value (Millions) | Source & Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $727.75 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ended Jun 29, 2025 |
| Gross Margin | 23.13% | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ended Jun 29, 2025 |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $57.10 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ended Jun 29, 2025 |

| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | ($87.37) | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ended Jun 29, 2025 |
| Change in Working Capital | $12.34 | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ended Jun 29, 2025 |
| Interest Expense | ($23.96) | StockAnalysis.com, TTM ended Jun 29, 2025 |
| Cash & Equivalents | $16.62 | StockAnalysis.com, as of Jun 29, 2025 |
| Total Debt | $630.16 | StockAnalysis.com, as of Jun 29, 2025 |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 75.35 | StockAnalysis.com, as of Aug 22, 2025 |

**B) Market-Implied Assumptions**

To determine what the market is pricing in, we solve for the 5-year revenue growth rate that justifies the current enterprise value, holding the TTM operating margin constant.

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $549.29M (Market Cap) + $630.16M (Debt) - $16.62M (Cash) = **$1,162.83M**
*   **WACC (calculation in Part 2):** 8.76% (Revised WACC)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

After iterating a DCF model, the analysis shows that to justify the current enterprise value of **$1,162.83M**, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 7.5%**, assuming the TTM operating margin of 7.85% remains constant.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the stock price of $7.29, an investor must believe that Portillo's will grow its revenue by an average of 7.5% annually for the next five years while maintaining its current operating profitability, before settling into a 2.5% terminal growth rate.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation**

This section builds a balanced, independent estimate of Portillo's intrinsic value by correcting flawed assumptions and modeling a more realistic business lifecycle.

**C) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | 12% tapering to 7% | The 3-year historical CAGR is ~12%. The original model's 7.5% implied growth is too low for a company in an active expansion phase. A 12% growth rate tapering to 7% acknowledges near-term aggressive expansion and the law of large numbers over time. |
| **Operating Margin** | 8.0% expanding to 9.0% | A stable margin is unrealistic. As Portillo's scales, it should gain operating leverage (e.g., G&A costs grow slower than revenue). A modest expansion from 8.0% to 9.0% over 5 years reflects maturing operations and economies of scale. |
| **Tax Rate** | 22.0% | The TTM effective tax rate is 21.2%. The statutory rate is 21% plus state taxes. A normalized rate of 22% is a conservative long-term assumption. (Unchanged) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue**| 12.0% tapering to 7.0% | **(Correction)** The original model's fatal flaw was assuming perpetual high growth-phase capex. Realistically, as growth moderates, capex will shift from new store builds to maintenance, which is a lower percentage of revenue. Tapering from 12% to a more sustainable 7% reflects this lifecycle. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | 3.8% increasing to 4.2% | D&A will grow as the asset base expands due to high capex. This is modeled as a slowly increasing percentage of revenue to reflect a growing PP&E balance. |
| **∆WC as % of ∆Revenue**| 10.0% | The original 15% is slightly high. A 10% rate is more aligned with industry peers for inventory and operational cash needs during expansion. |
| **Net Share Count Change**| +1.5% annually | With no announced buyback programs and continued stock-based compensation, it is conservative to assume annual dilution. (Unchanged) |

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $815.08 | $904.74 | $995.21 | $1,084.78 | $1,160.72 |
| *Growth Rate* | *12.0%* | *11.0%* | *10.0%* | *9.0%* | *7.0%* |
| **EBIT** | **$65.21** | **$74.19** | **$83.60** | **$94.37** | **$104.46** |
| *Margin* | *8.0%* | *8.2%* | *8.4%* | *8.7%* | *9.0%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT\*(1-T)) | $50.86 | $57.87 | $65.21 | $73.61 | $81.48 |
| \+ D&A | $30.97 | $34.38 | $38.81 | $44.48 | $48.75 |
| \- Stock-Based Comp | ($11.41) | ($12.67) | ($13.93) | ($15.19) | ($16.25) |
| \- Capex | ($97.81) | ($104.05) | ($110.47) | ($113.90) | ($81.25) |
| \- ∆ in Working Capital | ($8.73) | ($8.97) | ($9.05) | ($8.96) | ($7.59) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)**| **($36.12)** | **($33.43)** | **($29.43)** | **($10.05)** | **$25.14** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium (ERP): **5.5%** (Standard assumption for a mature market)
    *   Beta (β): **1.60** **(Correction)** The original 1.82 Beta is excessively high. While PTLO is volatile, a 1.60 beta is still aggressive but better reflects its risk profile relative to high-growth peers and is less punitive.
    *   **Cost of Equity (Re) = 4.26% + 1.60 * 5.5% = 13.06%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt (Rd): 6.76%** **(Correction)** The implied rate was below the risk-free rate. A more realistic rate is RFR + Credit Spread (4.26% + 2.50% spread).
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 6.76% * (1 - 22.0%) = **5.27%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): $549.29M
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $630.16M
    *   Total Capital (V): $1,179.45M
    *   **WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd) = (46.6% * 13.06%) + (53.4% * 5.27%) = 6.08% + 2.82% = 8.90%**

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **(Correction)** Since the revised forecast projects a positive FCFF in Year 5, the Gordon Growth model is now a viable and theoretically sound method.
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%** (Assumed to be in line with long-run inflation expectations).
    *   Free Cash Flow Year 6 = FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g) = $25.14M * 1.025 = $25.77M
    *   **Terminal Value = ($25.77M) / (WACC - g) = $25.77M / (8.90% - 2.5%) = $402.6M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($104.46M) + Year 5 D&A ($48.75M) = **$153.21M**
    *   Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple from Gordon Growth = $402.6M / $153.21M = **2.6x**
    *   *Note: This 2.6x multiple is extremely low and suggests a flaw. The WACC of 8.9% is still quite high for a company in terminal state and the denominator (WACC-g) is large, suppressing the terminal value. A mature restaurant company should command a higher multiple. This indicates the Exit Multiple method is more appropriate to capture market-based expectations.*
    *   **Revised Approach:** We will use the Exit Multiple method as the primary valuation driver, as it better reflects market realities for a company still growing at 7%. A conservative multiple for a company with this profile is **12.0x**.
    *   **Terminal Value (Multiple) = $153.21M * 12.0x = $1,838.5M**

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   PV of Explicit FCFF = (-$33.17) + (-$28.23) + (-$22.75) + (-$7.14) + $16.63 = **-$74.66M**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $1,838.5M / (1 + 8.90%)^5 = **$1,196.2M**
*   **Enterprise Value** = $1,196.2M - $74.66M = **$1,121.54M**
*   **Equity Value** = $1,121.54M (Enterprise Value) - $630.16M (Debt) + $16.62M (Cash) = **$508.0M**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Year 5 Shares:** 75.35M * (1 + 1.5%)^5 = **81.16M shares**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value = $508.0M / 81.16M shares = $6.26**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$6.26/share**.
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($2.50/share):** Assumes lower revenue growth (8% tapering to 4%) and flat 7.5% margins with a 10x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case ($10.75/share):** Assumes higher revenue growth (15% tapering to 8%), margin expansion to 10.0%, and a 14x exit multiple.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   30% below Base-Case Fair Value = $6.26 * (1 - 0.30) = **$4.38**

**Risk Notes**

1.  **Execution Risk:** The company's valuation is heavily dependent on successfully executing its store expansion strategy, particularly in new markets outside of its home base of Chicago.
2.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** As a fast-casual restaurant, Portillo's is sensitive to slowdowns in consumer spending, which could negatively impact same-store sales and revenue growth.
3.  **Commodity & Labor Costs:** Volatility in food commodity prices and rising labor costs could compress operating margins if the company is unable to offset them with price increases or efficiency gains.
4.  **Valuation Sensitivity:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the exit multiple assumption. A small change in the terminal multiple has a significant impact on the final per-share value. The negative free cash flow during the initial forecast period highlights the "J-curve" effect of its current high-investment phase.

final answer is 6.26 $
