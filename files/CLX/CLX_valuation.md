### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Year 1)** | **0.5%** | Midpoint of management's guidance of -1% to +2%. (Q4 2025 Transcript, July 31, 2025) |
| **Revenue Growth (Years 2-5)** | **2.5%** | Assumes a return to modest growth in line with long-term inflation expectations and historical performance, following a year of normalization. |
| **Operating Margin** | **16.7%** | TTM operating margin. Management guidance on gross margin is "flat to +50 bps," suggesting limited initial operating margin expansion. Kept stable for realism. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **23.6%** | TTM effective tax rate. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **3.1%** | TTM Capex/Revenue ($220M / $7,104M). Assumed to remain constant. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Change in WC as % of Inc. Rev** | **-594%** | TTM Change in WC/Incremental Revenue ($-211M / $35.5M). Given the volatility, this is an area of high uncertainty. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **1.1%** | TTM SBC/Revenue ($81M / $7,104M). (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **ERP System Implementation:** The ongoing transition to a new ERP system creates short-term volatility in financial reporting and potential operational disruptions that could impact sales and inventory levels.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The company faces persistent competition in key categories like Glad and Cat Litter, which could inhibit market share recovery and pressure margins.
3.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** Consumer spending remains sensitive to macroeconomic uncertainties. A slowdown could impact demand for Clorox's premium-priced products.
4.  **Input Cost Volatility:** The business is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices and other input costs, which could impact gross margins if not offset by pricing actions or cost savings.
