### **D) Free Cash Flow Build**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**FCFF Formula:**

| (BRL, millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | US 10-Year Treasury Yield (August 21, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium | 7.48% | 5.0% base premium + 2.48% Brazil country risk premium. (NYU Stern, Jan 2025) |
| Beta | 1.88 | 5-year monthly beta. (MarketBeat, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Cost of Equity (Ke) | 18.35% | 4.29% + 1.88 \* 7.48% |
| Cost of Debt (Kd, pre-tax) | 11.55% | Inferred from TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt. |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 8.66% | 11.55% \* (1 - 25%) |
| Market Cap (BRL) | 22,427 M | $4.1B USD at 5.47 USD/BRL exchange rate. (CompaniesMarketCap, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Total Debt (BRL) | 13,956 M | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Weight of Equity | 61.6% | 22,427 / (22,427 + 13,956) |
| Weight of Debt | 38.4% | 13,956 / (22,427 + 13,956) |
| **WACC** | **14.62%** | **(0.616 \* 18.35%) + (0.384 \* 8.66%)** |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g) = 2.5% (long-term inflation expectation)
    *   Terminal Value = (7,231 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1462 - 0.025) = **61,230 million BRL**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = 10,906 + 1,430 = 12,336 million BRL
    *   Exit Multiple = 10.0x (conservative multiple based on historical data)
    *   Terminal Value = 12,336 \* 10.0 = **123,360 million BRL**
    *   The Gordon Growth method results in a more conservative terminal value, which I will use for the base case.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

### **I) Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Risks:** As a Brazilian company, StoneCo is exposed to the volatility of the Brazilian economy, including inflation, interest rates, and political instability.
2.  **Competition:** The Brazilian payments market is highly competitive, with both traditional players and other fintech companies vying for market share.
3.  **Regulatory Risks:** Changes in financial regulations in Brazil could impact StoneCo's business model and profitability.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The company's ability to continue to grow and maintain profitability depends on its ability to execute its strategy effectively.
5.  **Dependence on a Single Market:** StoneCo's revenues are almost entirely generated in Brazil, making it vulnerable to any downturn in that market.
