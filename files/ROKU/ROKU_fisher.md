**Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed.**
Roku, Inc. (ROKU), August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed include the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, and various earnings call transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku operates in the global TV streaming market, which is benefiting from the secular shift away from traditional linear TV. The company's primary revenue driver, the Platform segment (86% of 2024 revenue), capitalizes on the growing digital advertising and content distribution markets. In Q1 2025, Roku streamed 35.8 billion hours of content, a 16% year-over-year increase, indicating strong user engagement. The digital advertising industry, a key component of Roku's platform revenue, is projected to grow significantly through the end of the decade.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku has a stated strategy of investing in the growth of its platform through innovation. The company's 2024 10-K outlines key initiatives to "innovate the Roku Home Screen to expand monetization, grow advertising demand through deeper third-party platform integrations, and grow Roku-billed subscriptions." Recent developments include the launch of Roku-branded Pro Series TVs in Spring 2024 and a new, more powerful Roku Ultra streaming player in September 2024. The company also recently launched Roku Ads Manager, a self-service ad platform designed to attract small and medium-sized businesses.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's Research and Development expenses were $720.1 million in 2024, representing 18% of total net revenue. This is a significant investment, although it is a decrease from 25% of revenue in 2023. The output of this R&D is visible in the continuous software updates to the Roku OS and the expansion of its product line, including Roku-branded TVs and a new premium streaming player in 2024. The company's ability to remain the leading TV streaming platform in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by hours streamed suggests its R&D is effective at maintaining a competitive product.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's sales efforts are reflected in its strong Platform revenue growth of 17% in Q1 2025. The company has organized its ad sales teams into specialized groups to target different market segments, from Fortune 500 brands to mid-market clients and international markets. It has also expanded its programmatic ad capabilities by deepening its relationship with The Trade Desk and adopting UID2 to improve ad targeting. The company's large retail partnerships with Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, and Target, which accounted for 81% of device sales in 2024, demonstrate an effective distribution network.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku is not currently profitable, reporting a net loss of $129.4 million for the full year 2024 and a loss from operations of $57.7 million in Q1 2025. The company's consolidated gross margin was 44% in 2024, but this is split between a healthy 46% gross margin for the Platform segment and a negative 2% gross margin for the Devices segment. The strategy is to sell devices at low or negative margins to drive scale for the high-margin platform business. While the Platform segment margins are strong, the consolidated business is not yet generating a worthwhile profit margin.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving profitability. During 2023 and 2024, Roku implemented restructuring plans to reduce its operating expense growth rate. These measures included workforce reductions, consolidation of office space, and a strategic review of its content portfolio to remove underperforming assets. In the May 2025 earnings call, management stated they "continue to see the path to achieving positive operating income in 2026." The focus on growing the high-margin Platform business, while controlling operating expenses, is the primary strategy for margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), ['https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-yJ8Y-2e9E'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-yJ8Y-2e9E) (May 2, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku undertook multiple restructuring plans involving workforce reductions in 2023 and 2024 to slow headcount expense growth. As of December 31, 2024, the company had approximately 3,340 full-time employees. The 10-K notes an "entrepreneurial, execution-focused culture" and a commitment to fostering an inclusive workplace. However, the recent history of layoffs suggests that labor relations may be strained, which is not indicative of "outstanding" relations per Fisher's high bar.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is led by its founder, Chairman, and CEO, Anthony Wood, which provides long-term stability and vision at the top. The executive team listed in the 2024 10-K appears stable. There is no public evidence of significant executive infighting or turnover. The company's dual-class stock structure concentrates significant voting power with Mr. Wood, ensuring his continued control over the company's strategic direction.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's leadership team includes experienced presidents for its Media and Devices divisions (Charlie Collier and Mustafa Ozgen, respectively) and a CFO (Dan Jedda), indicating a layer of senior management below the CEO. The company's ability to operate and grow its distinct Devices and Platform segments suggests a competent level of operational leadership. While the founder and CEO holds significant influence, the presence of divisional presidents points to management depth.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's 2024 10-K includes a report from management asserting the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company's independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The company provides a detailed breakdown of its revenue and cost of revenue by its two segments (Platform and Devices), showing adequate cost analysis for investors. There is no recent history of material restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's key competitive advantage is its purpose-built operating system (Roku TV OS), which is neutral and not tied to a specific content ecosystem (unlike competitors like Amazon Fire TV, Apple TV, and Google TV). This neutrality makes it an attractive partner for a wide range of content providers. The company's large, engaged user base (89.8 million Streaming Households as of year-end 2024) creates a powerful network effect, attracting more content partners and advertisers, which in turn enhances the value proposition for users. The Roku Channel has also become the number two app on the platform by engagement, providing a significant source of proprietary ad inventory.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's business model explicitly prioritizes long-term platform monetization over short-term device profitability. The company states in its 10-K that it manages the selling prices of its devices "in an effort to grow our Streaming Households," with the expectation that this will "result in increased platform revenue and platform gross profit over time." This strategy of accepting negative gross margins on hardware to build a large, profitable user base is a classic example of prioritizing long-range profits. Management has guided toward achieving positive operating income in 2026, indicating a multi-year path to profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Roku had a strong balance sheet with $2.26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no significant debt. The company generated positive free cash flow of $298.4 million for the trailing twelve months ending March 31, 2025. In September 2024, Roku secured a five-year revolving credit facility of up to $300 million, which remains undrawn. This strong liquidity position and access to debt financing suggest the company is well-capitalized to fund its operations and growth initiatives without needing to resort to dilutive equity financing in the near term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roku's management team regularly hosts quarterly earnings calls and provides detailed shareholder letters that discuss both positive results and challenges. In the May 2025 earnings call, executives addressed the continued weakness in the media and entertainment advertising vertical and the macroeconomic environment. The company also provides detailed key performance metrics and has been transparent about its restructuring efforts and the associated costs. This level of communication indicates a willingness to discuss challenges openly with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's recent SEC filings does not reveal any material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of its management. The 2024 10-K notes that all employees are required to comply with a Code of Conduct and Business Ethics. The company has not been the subject of any major accounting scandals or regulatory enforcement actions that would cast doubt on the integrity of its executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**Synthesis (5–7 sentences):**
Roku scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly regarding its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and strong competitive position as a neutral platform. The company's strategy of sacrificing short-term hardware profits to build a large, monetizable user base aligns with Fisher's preference for a long-range outlook. The balance sheet is strong, mitigating dilution risk. The primary negatives are the current lack of overall profitability and the recent workforce reductions, which raise questions about the quality of personnel relations. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the company's ability to achieve its goal of positive operating income in 2026. A clear and sustained trend of improving operating margins would flip the "No" on "Worthwhile Profit Margins" to a "Yes" and solidify the investment case. Conversely, a failure to control operating expenses or a slowdown in platform revenue growth could jeopardize this goal and lower the overall score.

fisher score is 13 / 15
