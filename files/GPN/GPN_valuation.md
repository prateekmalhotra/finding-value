### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth (Year 1) | 5.5% | Midpoint of management's guidance for 2025 (5-6%). |
| Revenue Growth (Years 2-5) | 5.0% | A conservative estimate slightly below the 5-year historical average of 6.2% to reflect a maturing market. |
| Operating Margin | 26.38% in Year 1, then stable | TTM operating margin of 25.88% plus a 50 basis point expansion in Year 1 as per management guidance, held constant thereafter for conservatism. |
| Effective Tax Rate | 17.5% | The average effective tax rate over the last 3 years, excluding the outlier in 2022. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

This metric represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.30% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 20, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | Standard market premium. |
| Beta | 1.18 | Reflects recent market volatility. (TradingView, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Cost of Equity** | **10.20%** | `4.30% + 1.18 * 5.00%` |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Cost of Debt (pre-tax) | 3.58% | TTM Interest Expense / Average Total Debt. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data) |
| Tax Rate | 17.5% | As defined in assumptions. |
| **Cost of Debt (after-tax)** | **2.95%** | `3.58% * (1 - 17.5%)` |
| **WACC** | | |
| Market Cap of Equity (E) | $21,010 | (CompaniesMarketCap.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $16,668 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **WACC** | **7.01%** | `(21010/(21010+16668))*10.20% + (16668/(21010+16668))*2.95%` |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (long-run inflation expectation).
    *   Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Value = ($3,375.98 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0701 - 0.025) = **$76,826.94 million**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + D&A = $3,405.43 + $1,707.00 = $5,112.43 million
    *   Median 5-Year EV/EBITDA Multiple: 12.9x
    *   Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA \* Exit Multiple = $5,112.43 * 12.9 = **$65,950.35 million**

As the Exit Multiple method results in a lower terminal value, it will be used for the base case to maintain a conservative stance.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Present Value of FCFF | $14,032.55 |

1.  **Competition:** The payments industry is highly competitive, with pressure from both established players and new fintech entrants, which could impact margins and growth.
2.  **Regulatory Environment:** Changes in financial regulations across different jurisdictions could increase compliance costs and affect business operations.
3.  **Technological Disruption:** The rapid evolution of payment technologies requires significant and continuous investment to maintain a competitive edge. Failure to innovate could lead to market share loss.
4.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a transaction-based business, GPN's revenues are sensitive to consumer and business spending, which can be negatively impacted by economic downturns.
5.  **Integration Risk:** The company has a history of large acquisitions. Future integrations may not realize the expected synergies or could disrupt operations.
