Synthesis:
Global Payments scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its market opportunity, profitability, and management team. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of digital payments, and its focus on innovation and strategic acquisitions should drive long-term growth. The two "No" answers are due to a lack of specific data rather than any clear red flags. To change the score, more transparency around R&D effectiveness and employee relations would be needed. Specifically, providing metrics on R&D return on investment and employee satisfaction would likely turn the "No"s to "Yes"s.

fisher score is 13 / 15
