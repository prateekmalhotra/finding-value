Carnival Corporation & plc, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 31, 2025, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The global cruise industry is projected to grow, with passenger capacity expected to increase from 733,010 in 2024 to 823,630 in 2027. Carnival, as the largest global cruise company, is well-positioned to benefit from this trend. The company is also expanding its offerings with new ships and the development of exclusive destinations like Celebration Key, which is expected to accommodate up to four of its largest ships simultaneously upon completion in 2026. This indicates a clear path for sales growth through both industry expansion and company-specific initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival has a robust new-build program, with six cruise ships expected to be delivered through 2033. The company is also investing in enhancing its destinations, such as the development of Celebration Key and the enhancement of Half Moon Cay with a new pier to accommodate larger ships. These investments in new capacity and destination development demonstrate a clear commitment to future growth beyond the current fleet and itineraries.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Carnival's filings do not explicitly detail R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, the company's commitment to innovation is evident in its fleet modernization and sustainability initiatives. The company is investing in new technologies and alternative fuels, including LNG-powered ships, to reduce its environmental footprint and improve operational efficiency. However, without specific metrics on R&D effectiveness, a definitive "Yes" cannot be supported.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival utilizes a multi-channel sales approach, including travel agents, tour operators, company vacation planners, websites, and onboard consultants. The company has increased its marketing and advertising programs, leading to double-digit growth in both new-to-cruise and repeat guests in 2024. The record booking trends and year-end customer deposits for 2024 further indicate a strong and effective sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the second quarter of 2025, Carnival's operating income increased to $934 million from $560 million in the same period of 2024. Full-year 2024 operating income was a record $3.6 billion, over 80 percent higher than the prior year. While historical data shows periods of losses, the recent and significant improvement in operating margins suggests a return to worthwhile profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm) (May 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival is focused on driving revenue through higher ticket prices and onboard spending. The company is also implementing cost-saving measures through fleet optimization, energy efficiency, and itinerary efficiency. Additionally, the development of exclusive destinations like Celebration Key is expected to reduce fuel costs and enhance guest experiences, potentially leading to higher margins. The company's focus on paying down debt also reduces interest expense, further improving net profit margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival states that it considers its employee and union relationships to be strong. The company has agreements with unions covering 52% of its shipboard employees and 22% of its shoreside employees. Carnival also emphasizes its commitment to being "travel and leisure's employer of choice" and provides extensive training for its maritime officers at the Arison Maritime Center.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Board of Directors and executive team of Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc operate as a single economic enterprise with identical boards and a single executive management team. The company's filings do not indicate any significant executive turnover or disputes. The long tenure of some executives, such as Micky Arison, who has been with the company for 53 years, suggests stability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's 2024 10-K lists a comprehensive executive team beyond the CEO, including a Chair of the Boards of Directors, a Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer, and other key positions. The company's multi-brand structure also suggests a deep bench of leadership at the brand level. The company's succession planning process is enhanced by this structure, fostering the professional development of management and team members.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's financial statements are audited by a registered public accounting firm, and the company's management has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective. The company provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for analysis of its various business units. The company’s 2024 10-K includes a report from the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's portfolio of nine distinct cruise brands catering to different market segments (contemporary, premium, and luxury) provides a significant competitive advantage. The company's scale allows it to invest in exclusive destinations and new ships, which are difficult for smaller competitors to replicate. The company's ownership of Holland America Princess Alaska Tours further enhances its offerings in the important Alaskan market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival's strategy of investing in new ships with long lead times (deliveries scheduled through 2033) and developing exclusive destinations like Celebration Key (opening in 2025 with a second pier in 2026) demonstrates a focus on long-term growth. The company's commitment to its 2030 sustainability goals, including investments in LNG technology and other environmental initiatives, also reflects a long-range perspective. These long-term investments may impact short-term profits but are intended to create durable value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of May 31, 2025, Carnival had $5.2 billion of liquidity, including $2.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $3.0 billion available under its revolving credit facility. The company has been actively managing its debt, with prepayments of over $7 billion since the beginning of 2023. While the company has substantial debt, its strong cash flow from operations ($5.9 billion in 2024) and access to debt markets, including export credit facilities for new builds, suggest it can fund its growth plans without significant equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm) (May 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival Corporation & plc holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed financial reporting through its SEC filings. The company's filings include extensive discussion of risk factors, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical events, and cybersecurity incidents. This level of transparency suggests a willingness to communicate openly with investors during both good and bad times.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000052/ccl-20250531.htm) (May 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CCL/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CCL/transcripts/)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carnival has a Global Ethics and Compliance department and a Business Partner Code of Conduct. However, the company has faced legal and regulatory issues, including a lawsuit related to the Helms-Burton Act and a notice of potential civil penalties for alleged Clean Water Act violations. While the company is defending itself in these matters, the existence of such issues prevents an unqualified "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000007/ccl-20241130.htm) (November 30, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/815097/000081509725000025/ccl-20250228.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
Carnival Corporation & plc scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market position, growth prospects, and operational execution. The company's strong brand portfolio, commitment to fleet expansion and destination development, and effective sales and marketing organization are key positives. However, the score is negatively impacted by a lack of specific data on R&D effectiveness and the presence of legal and regulatory issues that call into question the "unquestionable integrity" of its management. Over the next 12-24 months, the key variables that could change the score are the successful launch and ramp-up of the Celebration Key destination, the continued improvement of profit margins, and the resolution of outstanding legal matters. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosure on R&D spending and its outcomes. A "No" on integrity could be flipped to a "Yes" with the favorable resolution of current legal proceedings and a period of no new significant regulatory or legal issues.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
