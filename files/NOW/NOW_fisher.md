---
**Synthesis:** ServiceNow scores highly across all of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a strong competitive position, a large and growing market opportunity, and a high-quality management team. The company's key strengths are its platform-based business model, which creates significant competitive advantages, and its consistent execution in both product innovation and sales. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the company's expansion into new markets beyond its core ITSM business and its ability to continue to innovate and lead in the rapidly evolving field of generative AI. A "No" on any of the points would likely require a significant negative event, such as a major product misstep, a series of executive departures, or a material weakness in financial reporting.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
