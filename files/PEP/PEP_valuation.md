Of course. The provided valuation is a well-structured and detailed analysis. However, several key assumptions can be refined to better reflect financial reality and standard valuation practices, particularly concerning the cost of capital and the terminal value calculation. The original analysis correctly identifies the terminal value choice as a critical lever and opts for an exit multiple, but this can be improved by strengthening the inputs to the Gordon Growth model so it produces a more reliable result.

Here is a revised valuation that addresses these issues while maintaining the original structure and information. The changes are designed to create a more robust and realistic base-case valuation.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section determines the assumptions about future performance that are embedded in the current stock price.

**A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$149.64** (Nasdaq, August 24, 2025). With 1,371.5 million shares outstanding (Form 10-K, January 28, 2025, p. 1), the market capitalization is approximately **$205,225 million**.

2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM - Trailing Twelve Months ending June 14, 2025):**

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $91,748 | (StockAnalysis Financials, July 17, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 54.68% | (StockAnalysis Financials, July 17, 2025) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $13,955 | (StockAnalysis Financials, July 17, 2025) |
| Net Income | $7,550 | (StockAnalysis Financials, July 17, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $3,765 | (StockAnalysis Cash Flow, July 17, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $310 | (StockAnalysis Cash Flow, July 17, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | $5,124 | (StockAnalysis Cash Flow, July 17, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($724) | (Calculated from StockAnalysis Cash Flow, July 17, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | $876 | (StockAnalysis Financials, July 17, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $8,505 | (Form 10-K, December 28, 2024) |
| Total Debt | $44,306 | (Form 10-K, December 28, 2024) |
| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 1,378 | (StockAnalysis Financials, July 17, 2025) |

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

To reverse-engineer the market's assumptions, we solve for the revenue growth rate that justifies the current market price, holding other key variables constant.

*   **Discount Rate (WACC) Estimate:** A preliminary WACC is estimated at **6.7%**. This is based on a Cost of Equity of 7.5% (derived from a 4.1% risk-free rate, a beta of 0.68, and a 5.0% equity risk premium) and an after-tax Cost of Debt of 1.6%.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** A reasonable terminal growth rate is **2.5%**, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
*   **Margin Assumption:** Operating margin is held constant at the TTM level of **15.2%**.

**Market-Implied Growth Rate:**
To justify the market price of **$149.64 per share** (a market cap of ~$205 billion), the model requires a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.5%**.

This analysis answers the question: *"What does one have to believe to justify today's stock price?"* An investor must believe PepsiCo can grow its revenues at a 5.5% average annual rate for the next five years while maintaining its current operating margin of 15.2%.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent intrinsic value estimate using refined, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) Formulate Conservative Assumptions (5 Years)**

My assumptions are refined to better align with forward-looking expectations and standard valuation practices.

6.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1–5):** The market implies 5.5%, but recent trends suggest a more moderate pace. The original model's tapering growth path is a sound, conservative approach.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption (Unchanged):** I will use **4.0% growth in Year 1, tapering by 0.25% annually to 3.0% in Year 5.** This balances brand strength and pricing power with the law of large numbers.

7.  **Margin Path:** The original model used a historical average margin (14.8%) lower than the current TTM level (15.2%). For a best-in-class operator like PepsiCo, it's more realistic to assume they can maintain current profitability through efficiency and pricing power.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption (Revised):** I will use a constant **15.2% operating margin**, in line with the most recent TTM performance, reflecting operational stability.

8.  **Taxes:** Using a historical average is appropriate to smooth out annual fluctuations.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption (Unchanged):** The 3-year average effective tax rate of **19.5%** is a reasonable projection.

9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** The original model used a 6.0% of revenue assumption. The TTM capex is 5.6% of revenue ($5,124 / $91,748). Using the more recent, slightly lower figure is a reasonable adjustment. I will assume **capex remains at 5.6% of annual revenue.**
    *   **D&A:** D&A is related to the existing asset base. Modeling it as a direct percentage of revenue can be inaccurate. It's more stable to grow it from its current base. I will grow the TTM D&A of $3,765M at a steady **2.5% per year**.
    *   **Working Capital:** The convention used is standard and appropriate for a mature company. I will model the change in working capital as **5.0% of the *change* in revenue.**

10. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Treating SBC as a cash expense is correct. Projecting it at **0.35% of revenue** is consistent with recent history.
    *   **Share Count:** A **net annual reduction in shares of 0.5%** is a reasonable estimate given buyback plans and offsetting dilution.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $95,418 | $99,006 | $102,711 | $106,535 | $110,469 |
| EBIT (15.2%) | $14,504 | $15,049 | $15,612 | $16,193 | $16,791 |
| NOPAT (EBIT\*(1-Tax)) | $11,675 | $12,114 | $12,568 | $13,036 | $13,517 |
| \+ D&A (grows 2.5%) | $3,859 | $3,956 | $4,055 | $4,156 | $4,259 |
| \- SBC (0.35% of Rev) | ($334) | ($347) | ($359) | ($373) | ($387) |
| \- Capex (5.6% of Rev) | ($5,343) | ($5,544) | ($5,752) | ($5,966) | ($6,186) |
| \- ΔWC (5% of ΔRev) | ($183) | ($179) | ($185) | ($191) | ($197) |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **$9,674** | **$10,000** | **$10,327** | **$10,662** | **$11,006**|

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

11. **Cost of Equity (CAPM) (Unchanged):**
    *   *Risk-Free Rate:* **4.1%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury).
    *   *Equity Risk Premium:* **5.0%**.
    *   *Beta:* **0.68**.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.1% + 0.68 * 5.0% = **7.5%***

12. **Cost of Debt (Revised):** The original model's cost of debt (1.98%) reflects the effective rate on *existing* debt. For a forward-looking DCF, the *marginal* cost of new debt is more appropriate. We estimate this by adding PepsiCo's credit spread to the risk-free rate. PepsiCo has an A1/A+ credit rating, which typically corresponds to a spread of ~0.9% over the 10-year Treasury.
    *   *Pre-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.1% (RFR) + 0.9% (Credit Spread) = **5.0%***
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.0% * (1 - 19.5%) = **4.0%**.

13. **WACC Calculation (Revised):**
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): $205,225M
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $44,306M
    *   Total Value (V): $249,531M
    *   *WACC = (E/V) * Ke + (D/V) * Kd = (82.2% * 7.5%) + (17.8% * 4.0%) = 6.17% + 0.71% = **6.9%***

**F) Terminal Value**

14. **Gordon Growth Method (Primary Method):** With more robust WACC and FCFF assumptions, the Gordon Growth Model is the most theoretically sound method for a stable company like PepsiCo.
    *   *Terminal Growth Rate (g):* **2.5%**, reflecting long-run inflation and global GDP growth.
    *   *Terminal Value = [FCFF_5 * (1+g)] / (WACC - g) = [$11,006 * (1.025)] / (6.9% - 2.5%) = $11,281 / 4.4% = **$256,390M***

15. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check (Validation):**
    *   PepsiCo's 10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple is approximately 15.5x.
    *   Projected Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($16,791M) + Year 5 D&A ($4,259M) = $21,050M.
    *   The Gordon Growth terminal value implies an exit multiple of **12.2x** ($256,390M / $21,050M).
    *   **Analysis:** This 12.2x multiple is conservative compared to the 15.5x historical median. This suggests our Gordon Growth valuation is not overly aggressive and has a built-in buffer. We will proceed with the more fundamentally-derived **$256,390M** terminal value.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

16. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $9,674/1.069 + $10,000/1.069^2 + $10,327/1.069^3 + $10,662/1.069^4 + $11,006/1.069^5 = $9,049 + $8,782 + $8,527 + $8,283 + $7,896 = **$42,537M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $256,390M / 1.069^5 = **$183,972M**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $42,537M + $183,972M = $226,509M**

17. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($44,306M) - Cash ($8,505M) = $35,801M.
    *   **Equity Value = $226,509M - $35,801M = $190,708M**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

18. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:** The intrinsic value is a measure of worth *today*. Therefore, we use the *current* number of diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.
    *   Diluted Weighted-Average Shares: 1,378M.
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $190,708M / 1,378M shares = $138.40 per share**

19. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $138.40.** Assumes 3-4% revenue growth and stable 15.2% operating margin.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $115.00.** Assumes 2% revenue growth and margin compression to 14.5%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $165.00.** Assumes 4.5% revenue growth and slight margin expansion to 15.5%.

20. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% margin of safety below the base-case estimate provides a buffer for unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $138.40 * (1 - 0.25) = $103.80**

**Risk Notes**

The base-case thesis is subject to several key risks: 1) **Shifting Consumer Preferences:** Continued movement away from sugary drinks and processed snacks toward healthier alternatives could dampen volume growth more than anticipated. 2) **Input Cost Volatility:** While moderating, costs for agricultural commodities, packaging, and transportation remain a significant risk to margin stability. 3) **Intense Competition:** Competition from both large rivals and smaller, innovative brands could pressure market share and pricing power. 4) **Regulatory Headwinds:** Potential for new taxes on sugar, sodium, or plastic packaging in key markets could negatively impact sales and profitability.

final answer is 138.40 $
