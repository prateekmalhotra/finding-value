Here is a detailed analysis of RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (RICK) based on Philip A. Fisher's 15-point framework.

**Company:** RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. (RICK)
**Date of Analysis:** August 24, 2025
**Primary Sources Reviewed:** Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024; earnings call transcripts for fiscal years 2023-2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc. operates in the adult nightclub and sports bar/restaurant industries. The company's growth strategy focuses on acquiring existing nightclubs and developing its Bombshells restaurant and bar concept. While the adult nightclub industry is mature, it is also highly fragmented, which presents opportunities for consolidation. The company's capital allocation strategy targets acquisitions with a minimum cash-on-cash return of 25%-33%, indicating a disciplined approach to growth. However, the Bombshells segment has seen a significant decrease in same-store sales and the company has terminated its franchising program for this brand.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a stated strategy of creating value for shareholders by developing and operating profitable businesses in the hospitality space. This includes acquiring and developing clubs and restaurants. The company has a history of acquiring new nightclub locations and has developed the Bombshells concept in-house. While the company has slowed the expansion of Bombshells, it continues to actively seek acquisitions of adult nightclubs. This indicates a commitment to expanding its portfolio of income-generating assets.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a hospitality and entertainment company, RCI Hospitality Holdings does not have a formal research and development (R&D) department in the traditional sense, and its financial statements do not report any R&D expenses. The company's innovation is more focused on concept development, such as the Bombshells brand, and operational improvements. While the development of Bombshells could be considered a form of R&D, its recent underperformance raises questions about its effectiveness.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales are generated at the individual club and restaurant level. The company's long history of operating and acquiring profitable nightclubs suggests a strong understanding of its customer base and how to market to them effectively. However, the recent decline in same-store sales for both the Nightclubs and Bombshells segments suggests that the company is facing challenges in the current economic environment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, the Nightclubs segment reported a gross margin of approximately 88.3%, while the Bombshells segment reported a gross margin of approximately 75.9%. The company's consolidated operating margin was 6.4% in fiscal 2024, down from 17.5% in 2023 and 26.7% in 2022. The decline in operating margin is due to higher operating expenses and impairment charges. While the gross margins in the Nightclubs segment are very high, the consolidated operating margin has been declining.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy includes disposing of underperforming units to free up capital for more productive use. In fiscal 2024, the company sold one Bombshells location. The company is also focused on unit-level operating performance. However, the company's operating margin has been declining, and the 2024 10-K does not detail specific, new company-wide initiatives to improve margins.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states that it considers its employee relations to be good and that none of its employees are represented by a union. The company employs approximately 3,613 people. However, the adult entertainment industry has historically faced legal challenges regarding the classification of entertainers as independent contractors. The company notes this as a risk factor. There is no other publicly available information to suggest either outstanding or poor labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's management team, led by President and CEO Eric Langan, has been in place for a long time. The 10-K does not mention any conflicts or disagreements among the executive team. The long tenure of the key executives suggests a stable and cohesive leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is highly dependent on its CEO, Eric Langan, who has a deep knowledge of the industry. The 10-K identifies the loss of Mr. Langan as a key risk. While the company has other executives, such as a CFO, the disclosure suggests a potential key-person risk.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K discloses material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. These weaknesses relate to the design and operation of controls over information technology, accounting for business combinations, and impairment assessments. The existence of material weaknesses indicates a significant deficiency in the company's accounting controls.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the adult nightclub industry is the ownership of real estate and the associated licenses, which can be difficult to obtain. As of September 30, 2024, RCI Hospitality owns 87 real estate properties, with 57 of them being locations where the company operates its clubs or restaurants. This ownership provides a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors and gives the company greater control over its locations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's capital allocation strategy, which prioritizes investments with high returns and buying back its own stock when it is undervalued, suggests a focus on long-term value creation. The company's willingness to acquire and develop new properties, which can have significant upfront costs, also indicates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a history of using a mix of cash, debt, and equity to fund acquisitions. In fiscal 2023, the company issued 200,000 shares of common stock as part of an acquisition. The company's share repurchase program, however, has more than offset this dilution. In fiscal 2024, the company repurchased 442,639 shares. The company's free cash flow of $48.4 million in fiscal 2024, while down from previous years, is still substantial and can be used to fund growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/935419/000162828024051384/rick-20240930.htm) (December 16, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's earnings call transcripts shows that management discusses both positive and negative aspects of the business. For example, in the Q2 2024 earnings call, management addressed the underperformance of the Bombshells segment and the steps they are taking to address it.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses in its 2024 10-K that the New York State Attorney General and the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance have executed search warrants on the company's corporate headquarters and three of its clubs in New York. The investigation appears to be related to the company's New York State tax filings and possible entertainment benefits provided to NY DTF personnel. An ongoing investigation of this nature raises questions about the integrity of the company's management and operations.
**Answer:** No

---
**Synthesis:**
RCI Hospitality Holdings presents a mixed picture when viewed through the lens of Philip A. Fisher's 15 points. The company's strongest positives are its long-range outlook, as evidenced by its disciplined capital allocation strategy, its portfolio of owned real estate and valuable licenses, which create a significant competitive moat, and a stable and candid management team. However, several significant concerns prevent a higher score. The company is facing declining same-store sales in both its Nightclubs and Bombshells segments, and the Bombshells concept appears to be struggling. The most significant red flags are the material weaknesses in the company's internal accounting controls and the ongoing investigation by the New York State Attorney General. Over the next 12-24 months, the variables most likely to change the score are the resolution of the New York investigation and the remediation of the material weaknesses in internal controls. A clean resolution to the legal issues and a demonstrated improvement in accounting controls would flip the "No" on integrity and cost controls to "Yes" and significantly improve the company's Fisher score. Furthermore, a turnaround in the performance of the Bombshells segment or a renewed focus on nightclub acquisitions could also positively impact the score.

**fisher score is 6 / 15**
