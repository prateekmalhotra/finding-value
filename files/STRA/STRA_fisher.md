### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway

**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Strategic Education operates in the large and fragmented post-secondary education market. The U.S. market alone has approximately 64.5 million adults over 25 without a college degree. The company is positioned to capitalize on this through its U.S. Higher Education (USHE) and Education Technology Services segments. In 2024, USHE average total student enrollment increased 6.4% to 87,550. The Australia/New Zealand segment also saw a 4.8% increase in average total student enrollment in 2024. Continued demand for upskilling and reskilling, driven by employer needs, provides a long runway for growth.

**Answer:** Yes
