Company: Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NGS), August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Natural Gas Services Group primarily rents and sells natural gas compressors to oil and natural gas companies. Demand is strongly tied to production levels, particularly in the Permian Basin where NGS has a significant presence. The most recent 10-Q filed on August 9, 2025, shows rental revenues increased 24% from the same period in the prior year, driven by fleet growth and higher pricing. Management commentary in the 10-K states that the industry's focus on large-horsepower, multi-well pad development and gas lift applications continues to drive demand for the larger compressor units that NGS is concentrating its growth capital on.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000110/ngs-20250630.htm' (August 9, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While NGS does not engage in traditional R&D, its "development" is focused on upgrading and expanding its rental fleet to meet evolving industry demand. The company's capital expenditures are heavily directed towards new, large-horsepower compressor units. In its 2024 10-K, the company notes a clear strategy of high-grading its fleet to capture the most profitable and in-demand segments of the market. This represents a continuous effort to develop its primary service offering in line with customer needs for higher-pressure and gas-lift applications.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's business model is not based on internal research and development of new technologies; it purchases equipment from third-party manufacturers. The company's financial statements, including the Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, do not list any research and development expenses. Therefore, the effectiveness of its R&D efforts cannot be assessed as there are no such efforts in the traditional sense.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's continued growth in a competitive market is strong evidence of an effective sales organization. Rental revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025, increased by $19.9 million, or 24%, compared to the same period in 2024, driven by a larger fleet and improved pricing. This sustained growth in its core business, explicitly detailed in the latest 10-Q, indicates a sales and marketing function that successfully capitalizes on market demand and maintains strong customer relationships.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000110/ngs-20250630.htm' (August 9, 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NGS has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. For the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the company reported a gross margin of 50.1% and an operating margin of 16.9%. This is an improvement from the prior year's quarter, which had a gross margin of 45.3% and an operating margin of 10.3%. This trend, reported in the Q2 2025 10-Q, shows a high and expanding profit margin.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000110/ngs-20250630.htm' (August 9, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to improve margins. The primary strategy, discussed in recent filings, is focusing capital on high-horsepower rental units, which command higher prices and better margins. Additionally, the company is successfully implementing price increases across its fleet. The Q2 2025 10-Q notes that margin improvements were due to "higher rental revenues attributable to a larger fleet and better pricing, partially offset by an increase in cost of rentals." This focus on a more profitable fleet mix and pricing power is a clear driver of margin enhancement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000110/ngs-20250630.htm' (August 9, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** According to its 2024 10-K, as of February 23, 2025, NGS had 352 employees, none of whom were represented by a labor union. The company states it considers its employee relations to be "good." While there are no disclosed disputes, there is also no specific, verifiable evidence (like turnover rates or employee satisfaction scores) to classify relations as "outstanding." The available information is standard and does not suggest a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's executive team shows stability. Key leaders, including the CEO, have been with the company or in the industry for a significant time, indicating a cohesive and experienced team. The 2024 10-K and subsequent filings do not indicate any recent, unusual turnover in senior management. This stability at the top is a positive indicator of solid executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K lists several executive officers beyond the CEO, including a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Commercial Officer. This structure indicates a distribution of responsibilities and expertise across key operational, financial, and commercial functions. This demonstrates a professional management structure with depth beyond a single key person.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Item 9A of its 2024 10-K, management concluded that as of December 31, 2024, its internal control over financial reporting was effective. The company's independent registered public accounting firm, Weaver and Tidwell, L.L.P., issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements. There is no history of major restatements or disclosed material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator in the compressor rental industry is fleet composition and service intensity. NGS has strategically focused its growth on standardized, large-horsepower compressors tailored for gas lift applications in the Permian Basin. This focus, as detailed in its 10-K, allows for operational efficiencies in maintenance and service and aligns perfectly with the needs of the most active drilling region in the US. This specialization provides a competitive advantage over less-focused peers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's capital allocation strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. NGS is aggressively reinvesting its cash flow into growing its high-demand rental fleet, which suppresses near-term free cash flow in favor of building a larger base of long-term, recurring rental revenue. For the first six months of 2025, the company invested $71.6 million in capital expenditures, a significant portion of its operating cash flow. This heavy reinvestment is a clear sign of prioritizing durable growth over maximizing short-term profits.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000110/ngs-20250630.htm' (August 9, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, the company had $98.5 million outstanding under its credit facility and strong operating cash flow ($47.2 million for the first six months of 2025). The company's 10-Q for Q2 2025 states that it believes "cash on hand, cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next 12 months." Given its access to debt and robust internal cash generation, the company is not dependent on dilutive equity financing for its current growth plans.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000110/ngs-20250630.htm' (August 9, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) in the 10-K and 10-Q filings provides a reasonably transparent overview of business drivers, including challenges. For instance, the company openly discusses cost pressures, supply chain issues for new equipment, and its sensitivity to commodity prices. The detailed risk factors and forthright discussion of operational variables in public documents suggest a culture of candid communication.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000110/ngs-20250630.htm' (August 9, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's most recent filings reveals no significant red flags that would question management's integrity. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K states there are no material pending legal proceedings. There are no disclosed related-party transactions that appear problematic, and the company has clean audit opinions. The absence of such issues is strong evidence of a management team with high standards of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (February 28, 2025)]

Synthesis
Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting a focused, financially sound, and well-managed enterprise. The company's strongest attributes are its clear growth strategy tied to the active Permian Basin, a demonstrated ability to improve profit margins through pricing and fleet management, and a solid financial position that funds growth without shareholder dilution. The primary weaknesses identified are a lack of traditional R&D, which is inherent to the industry, and the absence of "outstanding" evidence for its labor relations beyond standard disclosures. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the price of natural gas and oil, which directly impacts customer demand and could challenge the "Long Runway" thesis. A significant downturn in energy markets could pressure margins and growth, potentially flipping several "Yes" answers to "No". To change the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes", the company would need to provide concrete data, such as employee retention rates or third-party awards for workplace culture.

fisher score is 13 / 15
