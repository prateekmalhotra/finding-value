Company: Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH)
Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 10-K Report (February 28, 2025), Q1 2025 10-Q Report (May 9, 2025).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse has multiple avenues for significant growth. The company continues to expand its core Texas Roadhouse brand, opening 26 new company restaurants in 2024 and acquiring 14 franchise locations in the first quarter of 2025. It is also scaling its newer concepts, Bubba's 33 and Jaggers, which are in the early stages of their growth cycle. Furthermore, the company is expanding internationally, with 57 international franchise locations and area development agreements in several foreign countries, representing a large, underpenetrated market. Consistent comparable restaurant sales growth, which was 8.5% for the full year 2024 and 3.5% in Q1 2025 on top of a strong prior year, demonstrates the enduring demand for its core offering.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing multiple initiatives beyond the core Texas Roadhouse brand. The continued development of the Bubba's 33 and Jaggers concepts is a primary example of incubating future growth drivers. The company is also investing in technology to enhance efficiency and guest experience, such as kitchen display systems to handle increased volumes and a customized digital app for waitlisting and to-go orders. Additionally, Texas Roadhouse is expanding its brand into retail channels through licensing arrangements for products like steak sauces and seasonings, creating new revenue streams. Capital is also being deployed to enhance existing assets through relocations and expansions to accommodate higher volumes.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a restaurant, R&D is reflected in menu, concept, and process development. Texas Roadhouse is deliberately conservative with its core menu, prioritizing consistency and operational efficiency over chasing trends. Its primary R&D is in new concepts and technology. The Bubba's 33 concept is showing success, with comparable sales growth of 5.5% in 2024 and 3.9% in Q1 2025, validating the development effort. The implementation of kitchen and guest-facing technology is aimed at improving throughput and handling the significant traffic growth seen in recent years, suggesting a practical and effective approach to process R&D.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse's "sales organization" consists of its localized marketing and in-restaurant service execution. The company explicitly avoids national advertising, instead empowering local managers and marketing coordinators to build community ties, which it believes is more effective at driving traffic. This strategy is supported by strong performance metrics, including a 4.4% increase in guest traffic in 2024 and consistent comparable sales growth. The focus on service quality, with low server-to-table ratios, aims to create a superior guest experience that fosters loyalty and repeat business, acting as the most potent form of sales and marketing.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse demonstrates strong and improving profitability relative to its peers. For the full year 2024, the company achieved a restaurant-level profit margin of 17.1% and an operating margin of 9.6%, a significant increase from 15.4% and 7.6%, respectively, in 2023. In the competitive casual dining sector, its operating margin of 9.6% compares favorably to most major competitors, such as Bloomin' Brands (3.14%) and Brinker International (3.73%), and is approaching industry leader Darden Restaurants (10.32%).
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1289460/000155837025001904/txrh-20241231x10k.htm (February 28, 2025), https://companiesmarketcap.com/texas-roadhouse/operating-margin/ (August 20, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively implementing several strategies to improve margins. The company has demonstrated pricing power, enacting menu price increases of 2.2% in Q2 2024 and 1.4% in April 2025 to offset inflation without deterring customer traffic. It is also focused on productivity; the 2024 10-K noted that labor costs as a percentage of sales declined due to productivity gains and higher average checks, which more than offset 4.6% wage inflation. Investments in kitchen technology are designed to enhance efficiency and manage higher volumes, directly supporting margin improvement efforts by controlling labor costs.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company promotes a "People-First" culture and has a unique compensation model for restaurant managers ("managing partners") that fosters an ownership mentality, requiring a deposit and paying a percentage of their restaurant's pre-tax profits. This structure is designed to attract and retain high-performing, entrepreneurial leaders. For all employees, the company offers competitive benefits and support through programs like "Andy's Outreach," an employee relief fund. While external metrics on hourly employee retention are mixed compared to the broad market, they are favorable against direct competitors, suggesting relations are strong for its industry.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a clear succession pipeline, with many leaders promoted from within after long tenures. CEO Gerald Morgan joined in 1997 and held roles as Managing Partner and Market Partner before becoming CEO in 2021. President Regina Tobin joined in 1996 and held similar operational roles. This history indicates a stable and cohesive leadership team with deep operational experience. Compensation appears aligned with performance, and there are no public reports of significant executive infighting or controversial departures.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's structure creates significant management depth below the executive level. The "market partner" system, which oversees groups of restaurants, serves as a crucial layer of experienced operational leadership and a training ground for future executives. The 2024 10-K details the biographies of six named executive officers, including the CEO, President, CFO, CLO, CTO, and CCO, showing a breadth of leadership across key functions. The practice of promoting from within, as seen with the CEO and President, suggests a well-established bench of talent and a focus on succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed segment reporting with restaurant margin as a key metric, allowing for clear analysis of its core operations. The Management's Discussion & Analysis section offers granular detail on the drivers of cost changes, such as breaking down commodity and labor inflation to a tenth of a percent. The company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Texas Roadhouse's "managing partner" operator model is a key differentiator in the casual dining industry. This model attracts highly motivated, experienced operators by giving them a direct stake in their restaurant's profitability, which drives superior execution and a culture of ownership that is difficult for competitors to replicate. Another clue is the decision to focus primarily on dinner service, which allows for better cost control, streamlined operations, and higher food quality preparation compared to competitors managing multiple dayparts. These operational choices result in industry-leading unit volumes and guest traffic.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes a long-term approach, particularly in its pricing strategy. The 2024 10-K states, "When we evaluate menu pricing, we focus on remaining disciplined as we balance short-term pressures with long-term growth while always keeping our guest top of mind." This indicates a willingness to absorb some margin pressure to protect its value proposition and maintain customer loyalty rather than maximizing short-term profit. The ongoing investment in new concepts (Bubba's 33, Jaggers) and technology, which require upfront capital and depress near-term margins, also points to a focus on building long-term, durable growth engines.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong financial position with a history of funding growth through operating cash flow. In Q1 2025, the company generated $237.7 million in cash from operations, which is sufficient to cover its capital expenditures of $77.4 million. The company maintains a strong balance sheet with $221.1 million in cash and no outstanding borrowings on its revolving credit facility as of April 1, 2025. Instead of issuing shares, the company is actively repurchasing them, having spent $50.2 million on buybacks in Q1 2025, which reduces share count and is anti-dilutive.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's financial disclosures in SEC filings are detailed and transparent, providing specific figures on factors like commodity inflation, wage inflation, and the components of same-store sales growth. For instance, in its Q1 2025 report, the company clearly explained the drivers of a restaurant margin decline, citing 2.1% commodity inflation and 4.6% labor inflation, demonstrating a willingness to discuss negative factors. Public earnings call transcripts show a consistent pattern of directness in addressing analyst questions regarding cost pressures and operational challenges. This level of detail in both good and bad times indicates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant legal or regulatory issues that would call management's integrity into question. The company's public filings do not show a history of major accounting scandals, shareholder lawsuits, or related-party transactions that are detrimental to shareholders. The 2024 10-K includes a Code of Conduct and outlines a clear policy against conflicts of interest. The independent auditor's report is clean, and the company's disclosures appear transparent and forthright. The culture of promoting long-tenured employees to top leadership roles also suggests a stable and well-regarded internal environment.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis:**
Texas Roadhouse scores exceptionally well against Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a business with a long growth runway, a differentiated and effective operating model, and a shareholder-friendly management team. The strongest positives are its unique "managing partner" culture which drives best-in-class execution, its disciplined long-term approach to value creation, and its robust financial health that allows it to grow without diluting shareholders. There are no glaring negatives, and every point was answered with a "Yes" based on available evidence. The two variables most likely to change this score in the next 12-24 months are a significant downturn in consumer discretionary spending that could test its pricing power and traffic trends, and the execution of its newer growth concepts, Bubba's 33 and Jaggers. A failure for these concepts to achieve attractive unit economics or a slowdown in their expansion pace could temper the long-term growth outlook.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
