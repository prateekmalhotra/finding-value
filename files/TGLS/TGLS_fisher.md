Tecnoglass Inc. (TGLS), August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K (filed February 28, 2025), Q1 2025 Earnings Transcript (May 8, 2025), Hindenburg Research Report (December 9, 2021).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass is expanding its addressable market and geographic reach. In late 2023, the company entered the vinyl window market, a strategic move it estimates will "more than double our addressable market." Tecnoglass is also actively expanding its US footprint beyond its Florida stronghold, opening new showrooms in Texas, South Carolina, and New York, with plans for Arizona and California in 2025. The company's backlog of future revenue stood at $655.7 million as of December 31, 2024, providing near-term visibility.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to reinvesting in the business to enhance production and expand its product portfolio. The company's capital expenditures were $88.9 million in 2024 and $87.3 million in 2023. Recent investments include establishing new vinyl window assembly lines with an estimated annual capacity of $300 million, further automating glass and window assembly lines to reduce costs, and upgrading coating machinery. This consistent, heavy capital investment in new technology and capacity underscores a clear focus on future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass's innovation appears to be driven by capital investment in process automation and new manufacturing capabilities rather than a traditional R&D program. The company's R&D spending was $2.1 million in 2024, representing only 0.24% of its $890.2 million in revenue. While new products like vinyl windows and "StormArmour" attachments have been launched, these seem to be the result of investments in new machinery rather than dedicated research. Given the low level of spending, the company's formal R&D effort cannot be considered a significant or particularly effective driver of its growth compared to its large-scale capital projects.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales growth and market penetration indicate a highly effective sales organization. Total operating revenue grew 6.8% to $890.2 million in 2024, driven by a 6.9% increase in the U.S. market. The company has successfully diversified its revenue base, with single-family residential sales growing to represent 41.9% of total sales in 2024, up from less than 5% in 2017. This growth has been supported by a strategic expansion of its sales infrastructure, including new showrooms in key U.S. markets to drive further geographic penetration.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass maintains profit margins that are well above its publicly traded peers. In fiscal year 2024, the company achieved a gross margin of 42.7% and an operating margin of 25.5%. For comparison, competitor Apogee Enterprises reported an operating margin of 8.7% in its fiscal year 2023. Tecnoglass's superior profitability is a direct result of its structural cost advantages from its vertically integrated manufacturing complex in Colombia.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass is actively investing in automation and process improvements to protect and enhance its margins. The company's 2024 10-K details numerous projects, including the automation of window and glass production lines to increase efficiency and reduce material waste, and the expansion of its aluminum capacity. These initiatives are designed to reinforce the company's core structural advantages of a low-cost manufacturing footprint and a vertically integrated business model, which are fundamental to its margin profile.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company reports strong labor relations, evidenced by a union-free workforce since 1983 and a focus on employee welfare. Tecnoglass's Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate was 2.3% in 2024, which it notes is substantially lower than the 9.1% average for manufacturing companies in Colombia. The company also invests in its community and employees through the Tecnoglass ES Windows Foundation, which runs a scholarship program for students and a home-improvement program for employees, having delivered over 107 housing improvements in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass is led by its co-founders, brothers José M. Daes (CEO) and Christian T. Daes (COO), who have run the business for decades, ensuring stable and consistent leadership. Their interests are highly aligned with shareholders through their control of Energy Holding Corporation, which beneficially owned approximately 48.9% of the company's outstanding shares as of December 31, 2024. This high level of insider ownership and long tenure of the founding executives indicates a stable and cohesive leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public disclosures are centered heavily on the co-founding CEO and COO, José and Christian Daes. While the CFO and two Vice Presidents are also named in the 2024 10-K, there is limited information available about the broader management team or any formal succession plans. The operational success of the company appears highly dependent on its founding executives, which creates a significant key-person risk and suggests a lack of demonstrated management depth below the top level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass's external auditor, PwC, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. In its report, management stated that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of that date. There is no recent history of restatements or disclosed material weaknesses, indicating that the accounting and control systems are robust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Tecnoglass's vertically integrated manufacturing model, based in a low-cost jurisdiction with strategic port access, provides a significant and durable competitive advantage. The company controls the entire production process from its 5.8 million square foot complex in Barranquilla, Colombia, benefiting from lower labor and energy costs. Furthermore, it leverages a unique logistical advantage by shipping products to the U.S. in containers that would otherwise return empty, resulting in highly attractive transportation rates that are often lower than domestic shipping within the U.S. This combination of production and distribution cost advantages is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a long-range outlook through its aggressive and consistent reinvestment in the business. The company has spent nearly $260 million on capital expenditures since 2022 to automate facilities, expand capacity, and enter new product categories like vinyl windows. These actions prioritize long-term efficiency, market share gains, and competitive positioning over maximizing short-term profits, even during periods when currency fluctuations negatively impacted margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, mitigating the risk of shareholder dilution. Tecnoglass generated $170.5 million in cash from operating activities in 2024 and held a cash balance of $134.9 million at year-end. Rather than issuing shares, the company is actively returning capital to shareholders; it has a share repurchase program and reduced its share count in 2024. Management states it expects to fund capital investments with cash on hand, indicating self-sufficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1534675/000149315225008697/form10-k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates transparency in its financial reporting. The 2024 10-K, for example, openly discusses the decrease in its gross profit margin from 46.9% to 42.7%, attributing it directly to the negative impact of a 5.9% appreciation of the Colombian Peso on its cost structure. The company maintains a regular cadence of quarterly earnings calls and SEC filings. This willingness to address challenges and unfavorable metrics in its primary disclosure documents is a strong indicator of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Fisher's criterion of "unquestionable integrity" is not met due to serious allegations raised in the past. A December 2021 report by Hindenburg Research alleged that CEO Jose Daes and COO Christian Daes had historical ties to the Cali drug cartel, including past criminal charges, and had engaged in undisclosed related-party transactions. While the charges were ultimately dismissed and an internal Special Committee found no evidence of fraud, the allegations are severe and the resolutions have been described as opaque. The high number of ongoing related-party transactions, though disclosed, creates potential conflicts of interest that prevent the company's integrity from being considered "unquestionable".
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Tecnoglass scores well on most of Fisher's points due to its powerful, vertically integrated business model that leverages structural cost advantages to produce industry-leading profit margins. The company has a clear growth runway through geographic expansion and new product lines, and management is aggressively reinvesting its strong internal cash flows into automation and capacity to support this growth. The primary negatives are concentrated in management and governance. The leadership team appears thin beyond the two founding brothers, and past allegations of serious misconduct, combined with a complex web of related-party transactions, prevent the management from being considered of "unquestionable integrity," a critical failure in Fisher's framework. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two factors: the performance of the new vinyl product line, which could affirm the company's product development strategy, and any new disclosures or lack thereof regarding management succession planning. A "No" on management depth could flip to a "Yes" with the elevation and clear highlighting of non-founding executives into key leadership roles with defined succession pathways.

fisher score is 11 / 15
