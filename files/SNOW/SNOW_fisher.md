**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake operates in the expansive and growing cloud data platform market. The company's revenue growth has been substantial, reaching $3.6 billion for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, a 29% increase year-over-year. Analysts project continued strong growth, with revenue estimates for fiscal year 2026 at $4.62 billion and for 2027 at $5.69 billion. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for cloud-based data warehousing, data lakes, data engineering, and AI/ML workloads. The global cloud computing market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 21.2% between 2024 and 2030, indicating a large and expanding total addressable market (TAM).

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake has a strong track record of innovation and continues to invest heavily in R&D to expand its platform's capabilities. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the company made several new features generally available, including Iceberg tables, hybrid tables, notebooks, Cortex AI, and Document AI. The company is also investing in its Native Application program to support developers building applications on its platform. The acquisition of Neeva, an AI-powered search company, and the launch of Snowflake Cortex AI demonstrate a clear commitment to integrating generative AI capabilities into its platform, opening up new growth avenues.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake's R&D expenses were $1.78 billion, or 49% of revenue, for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. This is a significant investment in innovation. The company's R&D efforts have resulted in a steady stream of new products and features, such as Snowpark, which allows developers to build on the platform using Python, Java, and Scala, and the expansion of the AI Data Cloud. The company’s focus on AI is evident in the recent launch of Cortex AI and the acquisition of several AI-focused startups. As of January 31, 2025, Snowflake held over 900 issued U.S. patents and had more than 400 U.S. patent applications pending, indicating a strong pipeline of innovation.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake’s sales performance is demonstrated by its strong customer growth and high net revenue retention rate. As of January 31, 2025, the company had 11,159 total customers, an increase from 9,384 the prior year. The number of customers with trailing 12-month product revenue greater than $1 million grew to 580 from 455 in the same period. The net revenue retention rate as of January 31, 2025, was 126%, indicating that existing customers are significantly increasing their spending on the platform. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the sales team in not only acquiring new customers but also in expanding relationships with existing ones.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake’s product gross margin for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, was 71%. However, the company is not yet profitable on a GAAP basis, with an operating loss of $1.46 billion for the same period. The company's significant investments in R&D and sales and marketing have resulted in continued operating losses. While analysts expect profitability in the coming year, the current lack of profitability is a concern.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm), ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFNhtR4ebSt03HoKZZwfdDDAA_K1FpUv-x1Ign3Is281WDT8XAVDjpz-gWf0oaL3dTIAqyiF6NVZxzqaTxqUN7E0A7-2ho7Ws1SY7qNxMU5ZNa3AGEfrxsEXYT7Q4ZJx3HawxZNoqNzY_K1GbWvNQCoXyFMJJatgcgGbmgKLFDPCRWd83X9_yviJCIr4fdvTzwdCBPgVi2gLO6xRtNBMONS5hgYNCQLsydNRNEiqkh7-U2bUMBuh7x3bSDarAOfwJhxRPVA'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFNhtR4ebSt03HoKZZwfdDDAA_K1FpUv-x1Ign3Is281WDT8XAVDjpz-gWf0oaL3dTIAqyiF6NVZxzqaTxqUN7E0A7-2ho7Ws1SY7qNxMU5ZNa3AGEfrxsEXYT7Q4ZJx3HawxZNoqNzY_K1GbWvNQCoXyFMJJatgcgGbmgKLFDPCRWd83X9_yviJCIr4fdvTzwdCBPgVi2gLO6xRtNBMONS5hgYNCQLsydNRNEiqkh7-U2bUMBuh7x3bSDarAOfwJhxRPVA)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake is focused on improving its product gross margin over time. The company's strategy includes optimizing its use of third-party cloud infrastructure, which is its largest cost of revenue component. While the product gross margin decreased slightly to 71% in fiscal 2025 from 74% in fiscal 2024 due to investments in new product capabilities that have not yet reached economies of scale, the company expects these margins to improve as these new offerings mature. The company has stated its long-term goal is to improve gross margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of January 31, 2025, Snowflake had 7,834 employees, and none are represented by a labor union. The company states in its 10-K that it considers its relations with its employees to be good. The company has invested in building a strong culture, with a focus on its core values, and strives to provide opportunities for employee growth and development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake has experienced some recent changes in its executive team. In February 2024, Frank Slootman retired as CEO and was replaced by Sridhar Ramaswamy. In February 2025, CFO Michael Scarpelli announced his intention to retire. In March 2025, the Chief Revenue Officer also announced his retirement. While management transitions are normal, the departure of several key executives in a short period could indicate potential instability. However, the company has emphasized a smooth transition and continuity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the CEO and CFO, Snowflake has a team of experienced executives leading its key functions. The recent appointment of Sridhar Ramaswamy as CEO, who previously led the company's AI strategy, indicates a focus on innovation and a deep bench of technical leadership. The company's ability to navigate recent executive transitions and continue its growth trajectory suggests a solid management team is in place.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly-traded company, Snowflake is subject to the reporting requirements of the SEC and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which mandate a rigorous system of internal controls over financial reporting. The company's independent registered public accounting firm has attested to the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025. There is no indication of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the company's accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake's key competitive advantage is its multi-cloud, multi-cluster, shared data architecture, which was built from the ground up for the cloud. This architecture allows for the separation of compute and storage, enabling customers to scale resources independently and elastically. The company's focus on data sharing and the AI Data Cloud creates powerful network effects, as more data on the platform makes it more valuable for all users. This is a significant differentiator from legacy on-premises solutions and even from the data warehousing offerings of the major cloud providers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake's management has consistently prioritized long-term growth and market leadership over short-term profitability. The company's heavy investments in R&D and sales and marketing, which have resulted in significant operating losses, are a clear indication of this long-term focus. Management commentary in earnings calls and investor presentations consistently highlights the massive market opportunity and the company's strategy to capture it by expanding its platform and customer base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of January 31, 2025, Snowflake had $5.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments. In September 2024, the company issued $2.3 billion in convertible senior notes, which provides additional capital for growth initiatives. The company's board has also authorized a $4.5 billion stock repurchase program. This strong balance sheet and access to capital should be sufficient to fund the company's growth without the need for significant dilutive equity financing in the near term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1640147/000164014725000052/snow-20250131.htm)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snowflake's management maintains regular communication with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor conferences, and public filings. The company's earnings call transcripts show a willingness to discuss both positive and negative aspects of the business, including the impact of macroeconomic headwinds on customer consumption and the challenges of navigating a competitive market.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no public information to suggest that Snowflake's management has been involved in any significant legal or ethical issues. The company's 10-K report does not disclose any material legal proceedings related to management integrity. However, it's important to note the significant insider selling by former CEO Frank Slootman, who sold over $500 million worth of stock in the past six months. While not illegal, the scale of this selling could raise concerns for some investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHsvVOF1L_LbRYn2eN_02cp5LbNM9mvvEFJwKEdesVVB2P83b8aIQ0br3KVGTJOXa9GVlfD4SoYddT3dogGS8HBcNhzQ3D6eWjspU8iTmUmooDzlvFrG61YCIGD5XHnHO-zFKwkZm4VRlJr2oVTjgIJoSRbSp_gfp-XjKBSSap4GoNYRBdMA2xhEI-xpgjVVU8zQyB1Zinm3uJ0l_jqS8uH-f44'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHsvVOF1L_LbRYn2eN_02cp5LbNM9mvvEFJwKEdesVVB2P83b8aIQ0br3KVGTJOXa9GVlfD4SoYddT3dogGS8HBcNhzQ3D6eWjspU8iTmUmooDzlvFrG61YCIGD5XHnHO-zFKwkZm4VRlJr2oVTjgIJoSRbSp_gfp-XjKBSSap4GoNYRBdMA2xhEI-xpgjVVU8zQyB1Zinm3uJ0l_jqS8uH-f44)

**Synthesis:**
Snowflake exhibits many of the characteristics of a Fisher-esque growth company, with a strong product, large addressable market, and effective sales organization. The company's key strengths lie in its innovative technology, which creates powerful network effects, and its focus on long-term growth. However, the company is not yet profitable and has recently experienced significant executive turnover. The two factors most likely to change the score within the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to achieve GAAP profitability and the stability and effectiveness of the new executive leadership team. To flip the "No" on profit margins to a "Yes," the company would need to demonstrate a clear and sustained trend of improving operating margins and ultimately achieve profitability. To flip the "No" on executive relations, the new leadership team would need to demonstrate stability and a continued ability to execute on the company's growth strategy.

fisher score is 13 / 15
