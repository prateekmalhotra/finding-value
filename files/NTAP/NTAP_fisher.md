Primary Sources Reviewed: Fiscal Year 2024 10-K (ended April 26, 2024), Q4 FY24 Earnings Call Transcript (May 30, 2024).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NetApp operates in the growing data management and cloud storage markets, driven by secular trends like digital transformation and AI. The Public Cloud segment, although smaller than the Hybrid Cloud segment, is growing, with revenues increasing 6% in fiscal 2024 to $611 million. The company's strategic position as a storage service natively embedded in major public clouds (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) provides a significant runway for growth as cloud adoption continues. The all-flash array business is also a key growth driver, with its annualized revenue run rate reaching $3.6 billion, up 17% year-over-year in Q4 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NetApp demonstrates a strong commitment to ongoing development through consistent and increasing investment in R&D. R&D expenses rose to $1.03 billion in fiscal 2024, an 8% increase from $956 million in fiscal 2023, which followed a 9% increase the prior year. This investment is focused on key growth areas like AI, cyber resilience, and operational simplicity. The company's strategy is to "deliver innovation to help customers create an evolved cloud experience," leveraging shared IP across its cloud and hybrid-cloud solutions to remain agile.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, NetApp's R&D spending of $1.03 billion represented approximately 16.4% of its $6.27 billion in net revenues. This level of investment is competitive within the industry. The output of this R&D is evident in its strong position in all-flash arrays and its unique native integrations with the largest public cloud providers. The company's ability to innovate and maintain leadership in these key growth areas suggests its R&D is effective relative to its size and spend. NetApp was recently recognized with the 2024 Google Cloud Technology Partner of the Year Award for the second consecutive year, indicating strong product development and partnership execution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024), [https://www.netapp.com/newsroom/press-releases/news-releases-2024/netapp-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-results/](https://www.netapp.com/newsroom/press-releases/news-releases-2024/netapp-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-results/) (May 30, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NetApp utilizes a multichannel distribution strategy, with 76% of net revenues in fiscal 2024 flowing through indirect channels. This extensive partner ecosystem, which includes technology partners, value-added resellers, and major cloud providers, is a key asset. The company's two largest distributors, Arrow Electronics and TD Synnex, each accounted for 22% of net revenues in fiscal 2024, demonstrating significant scale and reach. However, a 1% decrease in overall net revenues in fiscal 2024, attributed to a "weakened demand environment," indicates that while the sales structure is robust, it is not immune to macroeconomic pressures.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NetApp has strong and improving profit margins. The company achieved a record GAAP consolidated gross margin of 71% in fiscal 2024, a significant increase from 66% in fiscal 2023. The GAAP operating margin also improved to 19% in fiscal 2024 from 16% in the prior year. This profitability is robust compared to many competitors in the technology hardware space and indicates efficient operations and a valuable product and service portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins. The significant gross margin improvement in fiscal 2024 was primarily driven by lower component and freight costs as supply chain pressures eased. Additionally, the company has undertaken restructuring actions to reduce its cost structure and "redirect resources to our highest return activities." In fiscal 2024, NetApp executed two restructuring plans for a total charge of $44 million, aimed at streamlining the business and optimizing its real estate footprint for a hybrid work model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states, "None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider relations with our employees to be good." NetApp offers comprehensive benefits and has implemented a flexible hybrid work model. However, the company also conducted workforce reductions impacting approximately 2% of its workforce in fiscal 2024 and a more significant 9% in fiscal 2023. While restructuring can be necessary, repeated layoffs can negatively impact employee morale and make it difficult to classify relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](httpshttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability in its key leadership role. George Kurian has served as CEO since 2015, providing over a decade of consistent leadership. Other senior executives like the CFO, CPO, and CLO joined between 2020 and 2022, suggesting a refreshed but now stable team. There are no disclosed signs of significant executive turnover or internal discord.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K details the roles and extensive experience of five top executives, including the CEO, President, CFO, Chief Product Officer, and Chief Legal Officer. These leaders have backgrounds at major technology companies like Microsoft and Cisco, indicating a high level of experience. The detailed biographies suggest a capable and deep senior leadership team is in place to manage the company's various functions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NetApp's management concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of April 26, 2024. The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals. The financial reporting, including the breakdown into Hybrid Cloud and Public Cloud segments, provides reasonable transparency into the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for NetApp is its "data fabric" strategy, enabled by its ONTAP software, which provides a unified data management platform across on-premises and multiple public cloud environments. The company states it is the "only enterprise-grade storage service natively embedded in the world's largest clouds." This deep integration creates a significant technical and strategic differentiation, allowing customers to manage their hybrid and multi-cloud infrastructure seamlessly, which is a critical need in the current IT landscape.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent increase in R&D spending, which grew 8% in fiscal 2024 despite a 1% revenue decline, demonstrates a focus on long-term innovation over short-term profit maximization. Management's commentary in earnings calls frequently highlights strategic priorities like building out their public cloud services and leadership in AI infrastructure, which are long-term investment areas. The willingness to invest through periods of softer demand points to a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/NTAP/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/NTAP/transcripts/) (May 30, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NetApp has a strong financial position and a clear history of returning capital to shareholders, not diluting them. The company generated $1.7 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2024. It has a long-standing stock repurchase program, buying back $900 million worth of shares in fiscal 2024 alone and increasing the authorization by another $1.0 billion in May 2024. With $3.25 billion in cash and investments, a strong operating cash flow, and access to a $1.0 billion credit facility, the company is well-positioned to fund its growth without issuing new equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024), [https://www.netapp.com/newsroom/press-releases/news-releases-2024/netapp-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-results/](https://www.netapp.com/newsroom/press-releases/news-releases-2024/netapp-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2024-results/) (May 30, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management openly discusses challenges in its public filings and communications. In the 2024 10-K, the company directly addresses the "weakened demand environment, characterized by cloud optimizations and increased budget scrutiny" that led to a revenue decline. In the Q4 2024 earnings call, CEO George Kurian acknowledged the challenging macroeconomic environment while providing detailed outlooks and answering analyst questions directly. This transparency in addressing both positive and negative factors demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's 2024 10-K sections on "Legal Proceedings" and "Commitments and Contingencies" reveals no significant litigation or regulatory actions that would call the integrity of the management team into question. The company has standard disclosures regarding tax audits and minor litigation common for a firm of its size. There are no governance red flags, related-party transactions of concern, or other indicators that would challenge the presumption of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002047/000095017024071327/ntap-20240426.htm) (April 26, 2024)

Synthesis:
NetApp presents as a strong, mature technology company with several positive attributes under the Fisher lens, particularly its excellent profit margins, strong financial health, and a clear commitment to R&D. The company's unique competitive position, with deep native integrations into the major public clouds, provides a compelling long-term growth runway. However, the analysis also flags areas of concern. Recent revenue stagnation and workforce reductions suggest challenges in its sales execution and personnel relations, leading to "No" answers on those points. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the performance of the Public Cloud segment and the market adoption of its AI-focused storage solutions. A return to sustained, above-market revenue growth would flip the "Above-Average Sales Organization" score to "Yes." Similarly, a period of stability and growth without further significant layoffs would be needed to improve the score on "Labor & Personnel Relations."

fisher score is 13 / 15
