### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**
*   **Revenue Growth:** Year 1 growth is set to -3.5%, the midpoint of management's guidance. For years 2-5, a modest recovery is projected with growth rates of 1.0%, 1.5%, 1.5%, and 1.5% respectively, reflecting a mature and challenging beer market.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 15.15%. To align with the guided decline in pretax income, the Year 1 margin is adjusted down to the 3-year historical average of 14.8%. This margin is then held constant, assuming no specific management commentary on margin expansion initiatives.
*   **Tax Rate:** The 3-year average effective tax rate of **23.0%** is used for the forecast period.
*   **Capex:** Assumed to be **6.0% of revenue**, based on the 3-year historical average (5.9%), reflecting ongoing investment needs.
*   **D&A and SBC:** Projected as a percentage of revenue based on the TTM figures: D&A at 5.9% and SBC at 0.34%.
*   **Change in NWC:** Modeled as 5.0% of the change in revenue, a conservative assumption based on historical volatility.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flows available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| (in millions USD) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.30%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of Aug 19, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**, a standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta (Î²):** **0.67** (5-year monthly). This beta is sourced from MarketBeat and reflects a stock that is less volatile than the overall market, which is characteristic of a stable, consumer defensive company.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 0.67 * 5.0% = **7.65%***

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-tax Cost of Debt:** **4.56%** (Interest Expense / Total Debt = $298M / $6,539M).
    *   *After-tax Cost of Debt = 4.56% * (1 - 0.23) = **3.51%***

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Cap:** $10.53 billion ($51.32/share * 205M shares).
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $6.54 billion.
    *   **Total Capital:** $17.07 billion.
    *   *WACC = (10.53/17.07) * 7.65% + (6.54/17.07) * 3.51% = **6.06%***

### **F) Terminal Value**
*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.0%**. This rate is chosen to be conservative and reflects long-term inflation expectations.
    *   *Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)*
    *   *Terminal Value = ($1,252 * 1.02) / (6.06% - 2.0%) = **$31,452 million***

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** An analysis of historical EV/EBITDA multiples would be performed here. Assuming a conservative long-term multiple of 9.0x on Year 5 EBITDA of ~$2.5B, the terminal value would be ~$22.5B. As per instructions, the lower Gordon Growth value is used.

---

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** $5,370 million
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $23,401 million
*   **Enterprise Value:** $5,370 + $23,401 = **$28,771 million**
*   **Net Debt:** $5,925 million ($6,539M Debt - $614M Cash).
*   **Equity Value:** $28,771 - $5,925 = **$22,846 million**

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** $22,846 million / 205 million shares = **$111.44 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($85):** Assumes 0% growth post-Year 1 and a 14.0% operating margin, reflecting persistent market share loss and cost pressures.
    *   **High/Bull Case ($135):** Assumes a quicker return to 2.5% revenue growth and margin expansion to 15.5% due to successful premiumization and cost-cutting.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% Discount):** $111.44 * (1 - 0.30) = **$78.01**

### **Risk Notes**
The valuation is sensitive to several key risks. First, the **decline in beer consumption** in North America poses a significant headwind to revenue growth. Second, **input cost inflation** for commodities like aluminum and barley could compress margins more than anticipated if not fully passed on to consumers. Third, shifts in **consumer preferences** towards spirits, seltzers, and non-alcoholic beverages could erode the market share of Molson Coors' core beer brands faster than the company can innovate.

final answer is 111.44 $
