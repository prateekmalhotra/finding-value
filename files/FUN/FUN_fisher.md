Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed: Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed include the company’s 2024 10-K filing and recent news reports from August 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent merger with Cedar Fair has created the largest regional amusement park operator in North America, with a portfolio of 42 parks. This scale offers potential for synergies and expanded reach. The company is also pursuing international growth, with a Six Flags-branded park in Saudi Arabia expected to open in late 2025. However, recent reports from August 2025 indicate a significant 17% drop in attendance and a swing to a $100 million loss in the second quarter of 2025, raising serious concerns about near-term market potential.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHViqDsj51YLr6zUK5KnG0dtdplmyWc16CKRGumGkkL1Lcq7be4WXEqNyaEjxEhp4thZi0B9kJofBTH6Z8u_GENuJuUca2dCgxiw_gEUUKKgsY3b0I9nYCRNUmSar_cd80pyhgrZ9HcGTVMAEUeQ8rMNVZvqw-zlhGWbpdDZ0wpMeMA3Jsa9Ryy0PVKBU8lYunpcAushB4=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGviNCUnNnjtDpynkuiRZb4A8EMHWaFQ9V8ERh7CsEFDWSPkrSaWO2eOSwWUszt6ANbTRMHCytGtpql-DOTpO45tgt4gWQeYR4xLWfi1GS5cW0w6TQmhh-a3FwRfWSUxYdonVIAohEwwIOQqExVZ8PBGxxxd1UA2nEeZdOiki7W7I0ysC1rqz23y2wxf4kFBi-Uf4dmSvlFs2J7OGIZfxOnKrGEaizp9lpi-DsU4b4KMM7j7iafF4Kk_4PcyRF_pKtB_tk3zqdsLpBt6iXdhw==']

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a stated strategy, "Project Accelerate," which includes a plan to invest approximately a combined $1.0 billion in capital expenditures during 2025 and 2026. These investments are targeted at new rides and attractions, as well as in-park product offerings. This demonstrates a clear commitment to ongoing development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a theme park, R&D is best represented by capital expenditures on new attractions. The company's plan to spend roughly $500 million annually on capex is substantial. However, the effectiveness of this spending is questionable given the recent 17% decline in attendance. The new "Project Accelerate" strategy aims to improve the prioritization and activation of capital investments, but its effectiveness is not yet proven.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHViqDsj51YLr6zUK5KnG0dtdplmyWc16CKRGumGkkL1Lcq7be4WXEqNyaEjxEhp4thZi0B9kJofBTH6Z8u_GENuJuUca2dCgxiw_gEUUKKgsY3b0I9nYCRNUmSar_cd80pyhgrZ9HcGTVMAEUeQ8rMNVZvqw-zlhGWbpdDZ0wpMeMA3Jsa9Ryy0PVKBU8lYunpcAushB4=']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company utilizes a multi-channel marketing approach and focuses on long-term corporate sponsorships. However, the recent sharp drop in attendance and lower season pass sales suggest that the sales and marketing efforts are currently underperforming. The company's recent poor performance indicates a below-average sales organization at present.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGviNCUnNnjtDpynkuiRZb4A8EMHWaFQ9V8ERh7CsEFDWSPkrSaWO2eOSwWUszt6ANbTRMHCytGtpql-DOTpO45tgt4gWQeYR4xLWfi1GS5cW0w6TQmhh-a3FwRfWSUxYdonVIAohEwwIOQqExVZ8PBGxxxd1UA2nEeZdOiki7W7I0ysC1rqz23y2wxf4kFBi-Uf4dmSvlFs2J7OGIZfxOnKrGEaizp9lpi-DsU4b4KMM7j7iafF4Kk_4PcyRF_pKtB_tk3zqdsLpBt6iXdhw==']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year 2024, the company reported a Modified EBITDA margin of 33.2%. However, recent results from the second quarter of 2025 show a swing from a profit to a $100 million loss, indicating a sharp deterioration in profitability. This recent performance suggests that the company does not currently have a worthwhile profit margin.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGviNCUnNnjtDpynkuiRZb4A8EMHWaFQ9V8ERh7CsEFDWSPkrSaWO2eOSwWUszt6ANbTRMHCytGtpql-DOTpO45tgt4gWQeYR4xLWfi1GS5cW0w6TQmhh-a3FwRfWSUxYdonVIAohEwwIOQqExVZ8PBGxxxd1UA2nEeZdOiki7W7I0ysC1rqz23y2wxf4kFBi-Uf4dmSvlFs2J7OGIZfxOnKrGEaizp9lpi-DsU4b4KMM7j7iafF4Kk_4PcyRF_pKtB_tk3zqdsLpBt6iXdhw==']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "Project Accelerate" strategy explicitly targets margin expansion through cost synergies from the merger and revenue growth initiatives. These include leveraging technology, improving in-park offerings, and disciplined capital investment. While the strategy is in place, its execution and effectiveness are yet to be demonstrated, especially in light of recent poor performance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, approximately 2,275 of the company's employees were represented by labor unions. The company states that it believes it maintains good relations with its employees. There is no evidence of significant labor disputes in the reviewed documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent resignation of CEO Richard Zimmerman amidst significant economic losses raises concerns about executive stability and relations. The company is a result of a recent "merger of equals," and the leadership team is a combination of executives from both former companies, which can create integration challenges.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHViqDsj51YLr6zUK5KnG0dtdplmyWc16CKRGumGkkL1Lcq7be4WXEqNyaEjxEhp4thZi0B9kJofBTH6Z8u_GENuJuUca2dCgxiw_gEUUKKgsY3b0I9nYCRNUmSar_cd80pyhgrZ9HcGTVMAEUeQ8rMNVZvqw-zlhGWbpdDZ0wpMeMA3Jsa9Ryy0PVKBU8lYunpcAushB4=', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K lists a comprehensive executive team beyond the CEO, including a COO, CFO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Strategy Officer, and others. This indicates a deep bench of management talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly traded company, Six Flags is subject to SEC reporting requirements and independent audits. The 2024 10-K provides detailed financial statements and a breakdown of costs. However, the recent investor lawsuit alleging misleading financial statements brings the quality of the company's accounting controls and disclosures into question.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHViqDsj51YLr6zUK5KnG0dtdplmyWc16CKRGumGkkL1Lcq7be4WXEqNyaEjxEhp4thZi0B9kJofBTH6Z8u_GENuJuUca2dCgxiw_gEUUKKgsY3b0I9nYCRNUmSar_cd80pyhgrZ9HcGTVMAEUeQ8rMNVZvqw-zlhGWbpdDZ0wpMeMA3Jsa9Ryy0PVKBU8lYunpcAushB4=']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the theme park industry is intellectual property. Six Flags holds exclusive long-term theme park usage rights in key markets for Warner Bros. and DC Comics characters, as well as the Peanuts characters. This provides a unique and durable competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "Project Accelerate" and its significant two-year capital investment plan of $1.0 billion suggest a focus on long-term growth. These investments in new attractions and park improvements are designed to drive future attendance and revenue, even at the cost of near-term earnings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, the company had $4.96 billion of outstanding indebtedness. While the company's operating cash flow was positive in 2024, the recent swing to a loss in Q2 2025 puts pressure on its ability to service its debt and fund its ambitious capital expenditure plan without potentially resorting to dilutive financing.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGviNCUnNnjtDpynkuiRZb4A8EMHWaFQ9V8ERh7CsEFDWSPkrSaWO2eOSwWUszt6ANbTRMHCytGtpql-DOTpO45tgt4gWQeYR4xLWfi1GS5cW0w6TQmhh-a3FwRfWSUxYdonVIAohEwwIOQqExVZ8PBGxxxd1UA2nEeZdOiki7W7I0ysC1rqz23y2wxf4kFBi-Uf4dmSvlFs2J7OGIZfxOnKrGEaizp9lpi-DsU4b4KMM7j7iafF4Kk_4PcyRF_pKtB_tk3zqdsLpBt6iXdhw==']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K discloses an SEC investigation and a class-action lawsuit related to past disclosures. While the existence of these issues is a negative, the disclosure is a sign of candor. However, recent investor lawsuits allege that the company failed to adequately inform investors about its financial losses, which, if true, would indicate a lack of candor.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHViqDsj51YLr6zUK5KnG0dtdplmyWc16CKRGumGkkL1Lcq7be4WXEqNyaEjxEhp4thZi0B9kJofBTH6Z8u_GENuJuUca2dCgxiw_gEUUKKgsY3b0I9nYCRNUmSar_cd80pyhgrZ9HcGTVMAEUeQ8rMNVZvqw-zlhGWbpdDZ0wpMeMA3Jsa9Ryy0PVKBU8lYunpcAushB4=', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGviNCUnNnjtDpynkuiRZb4A8EMHWaFQ9V8ERh7CsEFDWSPkrSaWO2eOSwWUszt6ANbTRMHCytGtpql-DOTpO45tgt4gWQeYR4xLWfi1GS5cW0w6TQmhh-a3FwRfWSUxYdonVIAohEwwIOQqExVZ8PBGxxxd1UA2nEeZdOiki7W7I0ysC1rqz23y2wxf4kFBi-Uf4dmSvlFs2J7OGIZfxOnKrGEaizp9lpi-DsU4b4KMM7j7iafF4Kk_4PcyRF_pKtB_tk3zqdsLpBt6iXdhw==']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The ongoing SEC investigation and the recent securities fraud investigation by the Portnoy Law Firm raise serious questions about the integrity of the company's management and its disclosures to investors. The resignation of the CEO in the face of these challenges further erodes confidence.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**
Six Flags Entertainment Corporation's score is heavily impacted by recent negative developments in 2025. While the company has a strong foundation with its large park portfolio, valuable intellectual property, and a long-term investment strategy, the execution has been poor. The sharp decline in attendance, a swing to a significant financial loss, and the CEO's resignation are major red flags. The most critical variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the performance of the new CEO, the outcome of the investor lawsuits and SEC investigation, and the tangible results of the "Project Accelerate" strategy. To turn the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to demonstrate a sustained turnaround in attendance and profitability, resolve the legal and regulatory issues, and prove the effectiveness of its capital investments.

**fisher score is 6 / 15**
