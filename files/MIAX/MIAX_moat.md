### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** MIAX operates several exchanges, which inherently benefit from network effects. As more participants trade on their exchanges, liquidity increases, which in turn attracts more participants. The company has demonstrated strong growth in trading volumes and market share in the U.S. options market, indicating a growing network.
**Evidence:**
*   The MIAX Exchange Group's total multi-listed options market share reached 16.2% in June 2025, an 18.4% increase year-over-year. (Miami International Holdings Reports Trading Results for June 2025, July 10, 2025)
*   Total multi-listed options volume for the MIAX Exchange Group reached a record 1.7 billion contracts in 2024, a 6.5% increase year-over-year. (Miami International Holdings Reports Trading Results for December and Full-Year 2024, January 8, 2025)
*   MIAX reported record year-to-date volumes on MIAX Options, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX Pearl Equities exchanges in August 2024. (Miami International Holdings Reports Trading Results for August 2024, September 10, 2024)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for trading participants are moderate. While there are technical integrations and relationships to consider, the multi-homing nature of trading (participants often connect to multiple exchanges) limits the stickiness of any single exchange group. Deeper integration with MIAX's proprietary technology and clearing services could increase switching costs over time.
**Evidence:**
*   *Inference:* The existence of multiple competing exchange groups and the practice of multi-homing suggests that switching costs are not prohibitively high for participants.
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** MIAX's proprietary, in-house built technology could provide a cost advantage over competitors who rely on third-party technology. However, without detailed financial information on operating margins versus peers, it's difficult to quantify this advantage. The company's focus on technology suggests a strategy geared towards efficiency.
**Evidence:**
*   MIAX describes itself as a "technology-driven leader" with "in-house-built, proprietary technology." (MIAX Investor Relations, August 15, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** MIAX's primary intangible assets are its exchange licenses and its proprietary technology. The brand is not as established as some of its larger competitors, but it is gaining recognition. The value of their technology is a key part of their strategy, but its defensibility is not fully clear.
**Evidence:**
*   MIAX operates four U.S. options exchanges, a U.S. equities exchange, and a futures exchange, each requiring regulatory approval. (S-1 Filing Snippets, August 4, 2025)
*   The company emphasizes its "proprietary technology" as a key differentiator. (MIAX Investor Relations, August 15, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** In the exchange industry, distribution is primarily about connectivity to market participants. MIAX has established a significant presence, but is still smaller than the largest exchange groups. The scale of the largest players in the market provides them with an advantage that MIAX is still working to overcome.
**Evidence:**
*   The MIAX Exchange Group holds a 16.2% market share in the U.S. options market. (Miami International Holdings Reports Trading Results for June 2025, July 10, 2025) This indicates a significant but not dominant position.
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** As a significant player in the U.S. options market, MIAX collects a large amount of valuable trading data. This data can be used to improve their own systems and can also be sold as a product. The value of this data is directly related to their market share, which is growing but still lags the leaders.
**Evidence:**
*   *Inference:* With a 16.2% market share in U.S. options, MIAX has a substantial and growing dataset, but it is smaller than that of the market leaders.
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** MIAX is building an ecosystem around its exchanges, including clearing services through its acquisition of Dorman Trading. However, this ecosystem is still in its early stages compared to more established competitors who have a wider range of integrated services and third-party partnerships.
**Evidence:**
*   MIAX acquired Dorman Trading, a full-service FCM, in October 2022. (S-1 Filing Snippets, August 4, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The exchange industry is heavily regulated, creating significant barriers to entry. Obtaining the necessary licenses and approvals to operate a national securities exchange is a long and complex process, providing a strong moat for incumbents like MIAX.
**Evidence:**
*   MIAX's exchanges are SEC-regulated. (S-1 Filing Snippets, August 4, 2025)
*   MIAX Futures is a Designated Contract Market (DCM) and a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO), regulated by the CFTC. (S-1 Filing Snippets, August 4, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** Building and maintaining the technology infrastructure for a modern exchange is a capital-intensive endeavor. The specialized nature of this technology also creates a barrier to entry. MIAX's recent IPO was likely intended, in part, to fund these ongoing investments.
**Evidence:**
*   MIAX raised over $345 million in its IPO. (Fox Business, August 14, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** Revenue in the exchange business is primarily transaction-based and therefore can be volatile, depending on trading volumes. While there are some recurring revenue streams from data and listings, the majority of revenue is not contractual, providing limited visibility.
**Evidence:**
*   *Inference:* The business model of a securities exchange is primarily transaction-based, which leads to lower revenue visibility compared to a subscription-based model.
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (3 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (2 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (4 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0.54 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.36 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.08 + 0.24 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 2.38

Final Weighted Numeric Score: 23.8 / 100

### Mapping
The weighted score of 23.8 falls into the 10 <= Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1. However, due to the strong regulatory barriers and growing network effects, a score of 2 is more appropriate. The formulaic approach may be too conservative in this case.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is 5-7 years. The primary source of the moat is regulatory barriers, which are durable. However, the competitive landscape in the exchange industry is intense, and MIAX's moat is not yet as deep as its larger competitors. The company's ability to continue to innovate and grow its market share will be critical to extending its moat duration.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Technological Misstep:** A failure to keep pace with technological advancements could erode MIAX's key competitive advantage.
2.  **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in the regulatory landscape could lower barriers to entry or disadvantage MIAX's market structure.
3.  **Aggressive Competition:** Increased competition from larger, more established exchange groups could lead to a price war and erode MIAX's market share.

### KPIs to Monitor
*   U.S. options market share
*   Trading volumes across all exchanges
*   Operating margin vs. peers
*   Revenue from data and non-transaction sources
*   Pace of technological innovation and new product launches

### Short Verdict Paragraph
MIAX has established a solid foothold in the highly competitive U.S. exchange industry, primarily due to high regulatory barriers and the development of proprietary technology. The company's growing market share in the options market demonstrates a strengthening network effect. However, the company's moat is still developing and is not as wide as that of its larger, more established competitors. A significant increase in market share across multiple asset classes and the development of a more robust ecosystem would be required to justify a higher moat rating.

moat rating is 2 / 5
