### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal operates within the vast and expanding digital commerce and fintech landscape. The company is transforming from a simple payments provider into a comprehensive commerce platform, capitalizing on secular trends like the shift to digital payments and the growth of e-commerce. In its Q2 2025 earnings call, management highlighted that fintech is still in its infancy and expects more change in shopping habits in the next five years than in the past two decades. Key growth drivers include winning at checkout, scaling omnichannel experiences, growing Venmo, and expanding its payment processing (PSP) business, with Venmo revenue growing over 20% in Q2 2025.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Under new leadership, PayPal has accelerated its pace of innovation, focusing on transforming into a dynamic commerce platform. During the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Alex Chriss emphasized making "big and bold bets" in AI, advertising, and crypto to anticipate customer needs. This is supported by tangible actions, such as the introduction of PayPal World, a global platform to connect major payment systems, and a strategic initiative to reengineer its technology infrastructure to improve scalability and reduce costs. The company's 2025 Investor Day also centered on strategy, growth priorities, and product innovation.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's Technology and Development expenses were $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2024, representing about 4.7% of net revenues. This level of investment has supported an accelerated pace of innovation in 2025, including platform consolidation, infrastructure strengthening, and leveraging AI across the company. Recent launches like PayPal World and advancements in crypto payments demonstrate outputs from this R&D spend. While direct peer comparisons are complex, the company's ability to launch new global platforms and integrate advanced technologies like AI suggests its R&D is effective relative to its substantial scale.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh9Al2w-iA (July 29, 2025)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's sales and marketing efforts are intensifying, with expenses increasing 31% year-over-year in Q2 2025, driven by new campaigns like "PayPal Everywhere" and "Venmo Everything". These initiatives are yielding results, with both total and monthly active accounts growing 2% in the quarter. Furthermore, transactions per active account increased by 4%, indicating higher engagement from the existing user base. The consistent growth in Total Payment Volume (TPV), up 6% in Q2 2025, reflects a successful commercial engine that continues to expand its reach with millions of consumers and merchants.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh9Al2w-iA (July 29, 2025)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal maintains solid profitability. For the second quarter of 2025, the company reported an operating margin of 18%, an improvement from 17% in the same period of the prior year. For the full fiscal year 2024, the operating margin was 17%. The company has delivered six consecutive quarters of profitable growth, with transaction margin dollars growing 8% (excluding interest on customer balances) in Q2 2025. This demonstrates a consistent ability to generate profits from its core operations, even while investing in growth and navigating a competitive landscape.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh9Al2w-iA (July 29, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing margin improvement through cost discipline and operational efficiency. In Q2 2025, PayPal initiated a large-scale plan to reengineer its technology infrastructure, including migrating from data centers to more efficient cloud solutions, which is expected to yield annualized cost savings of approximately $280 million. This follows a global workforce reduction initiated in Q1 2024 to streamline operations and improve the company's cost structure. These actions, combined with a focus on "profitable growth," led management to raise its full-year guidance for transaction margin dollar growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has undertaken significant workforce reductions in recent years to streamline operations, including a global reduction in Q1 2024 and another restructuring in Q2 2025 to optimize its workforce. While such actions are aimed at improving efficiency, they can negatively impact employee morale and relations. The company's 2024 10-K notes its focus on fostering an inclusive culture and using employee feedback to inform programs, with approximately 24,400 employees globally as of December 31, 2024. However, repeated layoffs create an environment of uncertainty that is inconsistent with "outstanding" labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has experienced significant leadership changes, with Alex Chriss taking over as President and CEO in late 2023. Since his appointment, he has built out his leadership team, indicating a period of transition rather than long-term stability. The 2025 Investor Day showcased the new leadership team presenting the company's strategy. While these changes may prove positive in the long run, the current phase is one of formation and establishing a new track record, not one of proven, long-standing executive harmony.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGQal7Q-0-VJGFQi87fSjPr1eTBkLwEpO_jSlXiyhdgMQAdWInXSfr_smFjIwGt3zNPJDvRaGHa2SdW1y1ykijjoGFvCztubp6LqJNY7Tmczmtt62HPFeAuHj80al_olHij_2_9no6RRbbUAXJm4cSx (May 31, 2024)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEqjtBfxJVFC9XoJJm0i_1a8TmcMSgHgB7BOtjQC4bOH5v3jqdjGOJYrxeJcpi4bjqMrcP_Q1NG1t6o-2NaUTj2hn0Ytchp8-sQSONMAm1QkSFRiq_Zd6e9RH3q5hSAb52bA7fI9osAM-LLtVNd (February 23, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The new executive team under CEO Alex Chriss includes experienced leaders like Jamie Miller as Chief Financial and Operating Officer. The company's governance website and the 2025 Investor Day presentation highlight a full slate of executive and senior leadership responsible for key functions and strategic priorities. This indicates a professional management structure is in place. However, as the team is relatively new, its collective effectiveness and the development of internal successors (bench depth) are not yet proven over time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEGy0mL6vPj4MXP1EFcL0D5ingygD8hk4ewYXTv5w8Cy0Pm4avbql1brAauPnbemz6YVtAyPuQomUxaUimBVi3-b55kwXMSixVWLXPTSztJ7PqiJQ2Mi9utMJs= (August 19, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEqjtBfxJVFC9XoJJm0i_1a8TmcMSgHgB7BOtjQC4bOH5v3jqdjGOJYrxeJcpi4bjqMrcP_Q1NG1t6o-2NaUTj2hn0Ytchp8-sQSONMAm1QkSFRiq_Zd6e9RH3q5hSAb52bA7fI9osAM-LLtVNd (February 23, 2025)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh9Al2w-iA (July 29, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's financial reporting provides detailed breakdowns of operating expenses and revenues, as seen in its 10-K and 10-Q filings. The company's auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. There is no evidence of recent material weaknesses or significant accounting controversies. The detailed financial disclosures and clean audit opinion indicate that cost analysis and accounting controls are robust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's primary competitive advantage is its two-sided network at massive scale, connecting 434 million active accounts across approximately 200 markets as of year-end 2024. This creates powerful network effects: merchants are drawn to the large base of consumers, and consumers value the broad merchant acceptance. This scale, combined with trusted brands like PayPal and Venmo, provides a significant moat in an industry where trust and ubiquity are paramount. The company's ability to leverage data from both sides of the transaction to manage risk and personalize experiences is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current management team is balancing near-term profitability with long-term investment. While delivering its sixth consecutive quarter of profitable growth and raising near-term guidance in Q2 2025, the CEO also emphasized making "big and bold bets" on future growth drivers like AI and crypto. The company is also undertaking a multi-year technology re-engineering project to drive long-term efficiency. This dual focus suggests a pragmatic approach, aiming for sustainable long-range profit growth without completely sacrificing short-term results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGf5tKbrB_YkYPMZM0p4UrIio3Obu8_kr7dXWtRhPi73m0DnJgXdn106HNPpvURkDWqbYhApftfntHnkKeefNi8KpD4vE9Hwlius3y8BP0TcA7PeX46cisubpOR90BIwVO2gO3EkdgVtPjlcWqrYY5oFoKl4zfmHaXHH_O5ixw= (July 29, 2025)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh9Al2w-iA (July 29, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has a strong financial position with substantial cash flow generation. The company generated $7.45 billion in cash from operations in fiscal year 2024. Rather than issuing shares, PayPal has an aggressive share repurchase program, buying back approximately $3.0 billion of its common stock in the first six months of 2025 alone. As of June 30, 2025, a combined $16.9 billion remained available for future repurchases under its authorized programs. This strong cash flow and commitment to buybacks indicate a very low risk of equity dilution to fund growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current leadership team, installed in late 2023, has established a practice of communicating its strategy and progress openly, as demonstrated by its 2025 Investor Day and quarterly earnings calls. In recent calls, management has addressed challenges directly, such as the volume decline in its Braintree services, while explaining its strategic focus on "profitable growth" as the reason. This willingness to discuss both positive momentum and areas of strategic adjustment suggests a commitment to transparency with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000161/pypl-20250630.htm (July 29, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEqjtBfxJVFC9XoJJm0i_1a8TmcMSgHgB7BOtjQC4bOH5v3jqdjGOJYrxeJcpi4bjqMrcP_Q1NG1t6o-2NaUTj2hn0Ytchp8-sQSONMAm1QkSFRiq_Zd6e9RH3q5hSAb52bA7fI9osAM-LLtVNd (February 23, 2025)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPh9Al2w-iA (July 29, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal is subject to ongoing regulatory scrutiny inherent to the global payments industry. The company's 2024 10-K discloses several regulatory inquiries, including Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) related to various practices and a subpoena from the SEC regarding its stablecoin. While cooperation with regulators is standard, the number and nature of these investigations, including a securities class action lawsuit alleging misleading statements by former executives, prevent a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity at this time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm (February 4, 2025)]

---
Synthesis:
PayPal scores well on its market opportunity, commitment to innovation, profitability, and financial strength. The company is actively working to improve margins and has a clear strategy for long-term growth under a new, transparent management team. However, the score is held back by significant challenges. Recent and repeated workforce reductions suggest personnel relations are not ideal. The executive team is new and has not yet established a long-term track record of stability or depth. Most importantly, ongoing regulatory investigations and a securities lawsuit related to prior management's disclosures prevent an assessment of "unquestionable integrity."

Over the next 12-24 months, the score is most likely to change based on the execution of the new leadership's strategy and the resolution of regulatory matters. A "No" on Executive Relations and Management Depth could flip to "Yes" if the new team demonstrates stable and effective execution. A resolution of the outstanding CIDs and the securities lawsuit without major penalties or findings of misconduct would be critical evidence needed to change the "No" on Unquestionable Integrity.

fisher score is 10 / 15
