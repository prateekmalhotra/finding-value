**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

**F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Inputs | Calculation / Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth** | `FCFF_Y5`: $2,246M, `g`: 2.5%, `WACC`: 7.94% | TV = ($2,246 \* (1.025)) / (0.0794 - 0.025) = **$42,316M** |
| | *Justification for g:* 2.5% is a reasonable long-term growth rate assumption, in line with long-run inflation expectations. | |
| **Exit Multiple (Cross-Check)** | `EBITDA_Y5`: $4,861M, `Median Multiple`: 13.1x | TV = $4,861M \* 13.1 = **$63,679M** |
| | *Source for Multiple:* GuruFocus (13-year median EV/EBITDA). | |
| **Selected TV** | **$42,316M** | The Gordon Growth model provides a more conservative estimate, which is selected due to the significant discrepancy between the two methods. |

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **$34.71** | Based on the assumptions and calculations detailed above. |
| **Low / Bear Case**| ** ~$26.00** | Assumes lower revenue growth (starting at 2%) and margin compression to 20% due to competitive pressures. |
| **High / Bull Case**| ** ~$45.00** | Assumes stronger revenue growth (starting at 8%) from robust Macau recovery and margin expansion to 22.5%. |
| **Margin of Safety Price (30%)**| **$24.30** | A 30% discount applied to the Base-Case Fair Value to provide a buffer for estimation errors and unforeseen risks. |

**Risk Notes**

1.  **Macau Competition:** Management has admitted to underperforming in Macau and is now increasing "customer reinvestment." This strategic shift could lead to a price war or margin compression if not executed effectively.
2.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company's operations are concentrated in Macau and Singapore, making it highly sensitive to the regulatory environments and government policies in those specific jurisdictions.
3.  **Economic Sensitivity:** As a premium hospitality and gaming company, LVS is highly cyclical and vulnerable to downturns in global travel, tourism, and discretionary consumer spending.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation is supported by future growth from major capital projects, such as the Marina Bay Sands expansion. Any delays, cost overruns, or underperformance of these projects could negatively impact future cash flows.
5.  **Key-Market Dependence:** With the sale of its Las Vegas assets, the company is entirely dependent on the Asian market, increasing its geographic concentration risk.
