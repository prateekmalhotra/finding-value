### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

A review of the fiscal second-quarter 2025 earnings call on May 1, 2025, indicated no specific quantitative guidance for full-year revenue growth or operating margins. Management commentary was positive but qualitative.

*   **CEO Ryan McInerney:** "This quarter, we saw the strength of our business model with $9.6 billion in net revenue, up 9% year-over-year and EPS up 10%. Our key business drivers were strong... and consumer spending remained resilient in an uncertain and dynamic environment." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, May 1, 2025).

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5 Years)**

Given the lack of explicit guidance, assumptions are based on historical performance and management's qualitative commentary.

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Assumption:** **9.0%** annually.
    *   **Rationale:** This is slightly below the most recent quarter's growth of 9% and the 3-year historical compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 11.4%. This conservative rate reflects the law of large numbers and potential macroeconomic uncertainties, while still acknowledging the company's "resilient" performance.
*   **Operating Margin:**
    *   **Assumption:** **67.0%** (stable).
    *   **Rationale:** This is the TTM operating margin. Lacking specific management commentary on margin expansion initiatives, a stable margin path is the most realistic, evidence-based assumption.
*   **Effective Tax Rate:**
    *   **Assumption:** **17.5%**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is in line with the average effective tax rate over the last three years, which has fluctuated between 16.7% and 17.9%.
*   **Capital Intensity (Capex):**
    *   **Assumption:** **3.6% of Revenue**.
    *   **Rationale:** This is the TTM Capex as a percentage of TTM Revenue (($1,402M / $38,893M)). This aligns with the historical average, reflecting ongoing investment needs.
*   **Working Capital:**
    *   **Assumption:** **5.0% of incremental revenue.**
    *   **Rationale:** Change in working capital is volatile. A normalized assumption of 5% of new revenue growth is a reasonable, conservative estimate for a mature company.
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):**
    *   **Assumption:** **2.3% of Revenue.**
    *   **Rationale:** This is the TTM SBC as a percentage of TTM Revenue (($894M / $38,893M)). SBC is treated as a real cash expense.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

*   **Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

**FCFF Build (in millions USD):**

| Year | Revenue | EBIT (67%) | NOPAT | + D&A | - SBC | - Capex | - Î” NWC | **FCFF** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Y1 (2026)** | $42,393 | $28,404 | $23,433 | $1,272 | $975 | $1,526 | $175 | **$22,029** |
| **Y2 (2027)** | $46,209 | $30,960 | $25,542 | $1,386 | $1,063 | $1,663 | $191 | **$24,011** |
| **Y3 (2028)** | $50,367 | $33,746 | $27,841 | $1,511 | $1,158 | $1,813 | $208 | **$26,173** |
| **Y4 (2029)** | $54,900 | $36,783 | $30,346 | $1,647 | $1,263 | $1,976 | $227 | **$28,527** |
| **Y5 (2030)** | $59,841 | $40,094 | $33,077 | $1,795 | $1,376 | $2,154 | $247 | **$31,095** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.29%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   Beta: **0.94** (5-Year Monthly Beta). This reflects Visa's mature, blue-chip status with volatility slightly less than the overall market.
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard market assumption for a developed market like the U.S.).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 0.94 * 5.0% = 8.99%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** Interest Expense / Total Debt = $555M / $25,138M = **2.21%** (pre-tax).
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 2.21% * (1 - 17.5%) = **1.82%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   Market Capitalization (E): $343.93/share * 1,980M shares = **$680,981M**.
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): **$25,138M**.
    *   E / (E+D) = 96.4%
    *   D / (E+D) = 3.6%
    *   **WACC = (0.964 * 8.99%) + (0.036 * 1.82%) = 8.67% + 0.07% = 8.74%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = FCFF(Y5) * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This is a reasonable long-term assumption, reflecting expected long-run inflation and global economic growth, and is appropriate for a mature, market-leading company like Visa.
    *   **Terminal Value = $31,095 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.0874 - 0.025) = $31,872 / 0.0624 = $510,774M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT(Y5) + D&A(Y5) = $40,094M + $1,795M = $41,889M
    *   Historical Median EV/EBITDA multiple for Visa is ~20x. Applying a conservative **18.0x** multiple to Year 5 EBITDA.
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $41,889M * 18.0 = $753,002M
    *   **Decision:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value ($510,774M) and will be used, per the instructions to choose the lower value if a significant discrepancy exists.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $20,258 + $20,317 + $20,287 + $20,185 + $20,447 = **$101,494M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $510,774M / (1 + 0.0874)^5 = **$335,903M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $101,494M + $335,903M = $437,397M**

*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash & Equivalents
    *   Equity Value = $437,397M - $25,138M + $17,092M = **$429,351M**
    *   Citations: Total Debt ($25,138M, stockanalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025); Cash & Equivalents ($17,092M, stockanalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025).

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Weighted-Average Shares
    *   Fair Value = $429,351M / 1,980M shares = **$216.84**
    *   Citation: Diluted Shares (1,980M, stockanalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025).

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $216.84**. Based on the assumptions detailed above.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$185**. Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 7.0%) and slight margin compression due to competitive pressures, with a lower terminal growth rate (2.0%).
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$255**. Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 10.5%) driven by stronger cross-border recovery and new flows, with a higher terminal growth rate (2.75%).

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A **30%** discount is applied for a margin of safety against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $216.84 * (1 - 0.30) = $151.79**

### **One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include: (1) **Regulatory and Legal Challenges**, as increased scrutiny on interchange fees globally could pressure Visa's take rate and revenue model. (2) **Intensifying Competition** from fintech players, alternative payment networks (e.g., account-to-account payments), and private stablecoins could erode market share. (3) **Geopolitical Instability** could disrupt high-margin cross-border travel and payment volumes, a key growth driver. (4) **Cybersecurity Threats** remain a persistent operational risk that could result in significant financial and reputational damage.

final answer is 216.84 $
