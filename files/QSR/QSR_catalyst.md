### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Burger King "Royal Reset" Remodel Program

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Burger King is implementing a multi-year "Reclaim the Flame" plan which includes the "Royal Reset" program, a significant investment in restaurant remodels and relocations, technology, and equipment enhancements. As of March 31, 2025, $143 million of a planned $550 million for the Royal Reset has been funded.
*   **Mechanism:** Successful remodels can lead to increased foot traffic, higher sales per store, and improved franchisee profitability. This can translate to higher royalty revenues for QSR, improved investor sentiment, and a higher valuation multiple.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with a significant portion of the investment expected over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: 2% increase in Burger King U.S. comparable sales.
    *   Base: 4% increase in Burger King U.S. comparable sales.
    *   High: 6% increase in Burger King U.S. comparable sales.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The plan is already in motion with significant capital allocated.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful execution of remodels, positive customer reception to new store formats, and franchisee buy-in.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Burger King U.S. comparable sales growth, franchisee profitability metrics, pace of remodels.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Slower-than-expected remodel pace, cost overruns, negative impact on franchisee relations.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor quarterly earnings for updates on the "Royal Reset" progress and its impact on Burger King's performance.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** QSR has a share repurchase program with $500 million remaining under authorization as of March 31, 2025. The program is set to run until September 30, 2025.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS can lead to a higher stock price, assuming a constant P/E ratio. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** 0-12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: $100 million in share repurchases.
    *   Base: $250 million in share repurchases.
    *   High: $500 million in share repurchases.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a history of share repurchases, but the pace can be variable.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Sufficient cash flow generation, favorable market conditions.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A decision to allocate capital elsewhere (e.g., debt reduction, acquisitions) could slow or halt repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The repurchase program provides a degree of downside support and potential for EPS accretion.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** International Expansion and New Partnerships

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** QSR is actively seeking a new controlling shareholder for its BK China business and has a long-term strategy of partnering with experienced local operators to grow its international presence.
*   **Mechanism:** Successful partnerships in key international markets can accelerate restaurant growth, increase system-wide sales, and drive long-term royalty revenue growth. This can lead to a significant increase in the company's overall valuation.
*   **Timing:** 12-60 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: 3% annual net restaurant growth in the international segment.
    *   Base: 5% annual net restaurant growth in the international segment.
    *   High: 7% annual net restaurant growth in the international segment.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 15-25%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. International expansion is a stated priority, but success depends on finding the right partners and navigating local market conditions.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Identification of suitable partners, favorable economic conditions in target markets, successful adaptation of brands to local tastes.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Net restaurant growth in the international segment, system-wide sales growth in the international segment, announcements of new partnership agreements.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Failure to find suitable partners, geopolitical instability, increased competition in key international markets.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. International growth is a key long-term value driver, but it carries higher execution risk.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Burger King "Royal Reset" Remodel Program**

*   **Assumption:** A 4% increase in Burger King U.S. comparable sales leads to a 2% increase in total revenue.
*   **Formula:** Price Target = (Current EPS * (1 + % EPS Growth)) * P/E Multiple
*   **Calculation:** Assuming a current EPS of $3.00 and a P/E of 20, a 2% revenue increase could lead to a 4% EPS increase (assuming margin expansion). New EPS = $3.12. New Price Target = $3.12 * 20 = $62.40. This represents a 4% increase from a hypothetical current price of $60.

**2. Share Repurchase Program**

*   **Assumption:** The company repurchases $250 million of its shares.
*   **Formula:** New EPS = Net Income / (Current Shares Outstanding - Repurchased Shares)
*   **Calculation:** Assuming a market cap of $30 billion, $250 million would repurchase ~0.83% of shares. This would lead to a ~0.83% increase in EPS, and a corresponding potential increase in the stock price.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for QSR appear to be balanced. The "Royal Reset" program at Burger King has the potential to drive meaningful operational improvements and sales growth, but the execution risk is a key consideration. The share repurchase program provides a modest positive signal and some downside protection. However, the high level of insider selling is a significant negative signal that should not be ignored. Overall, the short-term market signal is neutral to slightly positive, with the success of the Burger King turnaround being the most critical factor.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failure of the Burger King Turnaround:** If the "Royal Reset" program fails to generate the expected sales lift and franchisee returns, it could lead to a significant decline in investor confidence and a lower stock price.
2.  **Deterioration in Franchisee Relations:** QSR's success is highly dependent on its franchisees. Any significant disputes or a decline in franchisee profitability could negatively impact the company's growth and profitability.
3.  **Macroeconomic Downturn:** A significant economic downturn could lead to a reduction in consumer spending on dining out, which would negatively impact all of QSR's brands.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on the available information, QSR presents a mixed but potentially rewarding investment case. The Burger King "Royal Reset" program is the most significant near-term catalyst, with the potential to drive a 10-20% upside in the stock price if successful. However, the high level of insider selling is a major red flag that suggests caution. The most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly comparable sales growth for Burger King U.S., as this will be the primary measure of the turnaround's success.
