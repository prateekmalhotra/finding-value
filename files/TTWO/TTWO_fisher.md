The company's R&D expenses were a significant portion of its operating expenses, as disclosed in its latest 10-Q filing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946581/000162828025026694/ttwo-20250331.htm March 31, 2025], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946581/000162828025038963/ttwo-20250630.htm June 30, 2025]

The company’s R&D spending as a percentage of revenue is comparable to its main competitors. However, the company's reliance on a few key franchises makes the success of each major release critical.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Take-Two's profit margins can be volatile due to the cyclical nature of its major game releases. In its latest 10-K, the company reported a net loss.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Take-Two is focused on growing its digital, direct-to-consumer business, which has higher margins than physical sales. The company is also implementing a cost-reduction program, which is expected to generate significant annualized savings. The release of *Grand Theft Auto VI* is expected to significantly improve the company's margins.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the video game industry, owning and controlling valuable intellectual property is a key competitive advantage. Take-Two's portfolio of owned IP, including *Grand Theft Auto*, *Red Dead Redemption*, and *NBA 2K*, is a significant differentiator.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Take-Two's management has consistently stated that its goal is to create the highest-quality entertainment experiences, even if it means longer development cycles. The company is currently making a massive investment in *Grand Theft Auto VI*, which is negatively impacting its near-term profitability but is expected to generate substantial long-term returns.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Take-Two had a strong balance sheet with a significant cash position as of its latest 10-Q filing. The company has a revolving credit facility that it can draw on if needed. While the company has issued shares in the past for acquisitions, its organic growth is primarily funded through its cash flow from operations.
**Answer:** Yes

However, the company is also known for being very secretive about its product pipeline.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/946581/000162828025026694/ttwo-20250331.htm March 31, 2025]

Synthesis: Take-Two scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, commitment to R&D, and strong intellectual property. The company's long-range outlook and experienced management team are also positives. The main areas of concern are its current lack of profitability and potential issues with labor relations. The release and commercial success of *Grand Theft Auto VI* is the most significant variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months. A strong launch would likely turn the "No" on profit margins to a "Yes." Improved disclosure on labor metrics could also improve the score.

fisher score is 13 / 15
