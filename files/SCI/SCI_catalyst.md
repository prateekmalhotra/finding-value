### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description:** Consistent execution of the company's share repurchase program, which reduces the number of outstanding shares and increases earnings per share.
*   **Mechanism:** A lower share count increases EPS, which, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher share price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's valuation.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with activity expected throughout the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: $100 million in repurchases at an average price of $80/share = 1.25 million shares retired.
    *   Base Case: $153.7 million in repurchases at an average price of $80/share = 1.92 million shares retired.
    *   High Case: $200 million in repurchases (assuming a new authorization) at an average price of $80/share = 2.5 million shares retired.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). The impact is derived from the reduction in share count and the positive signal to the market.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a consistent history of share repurchases, and the board has authorized a program.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a favorable stock price.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q and 10-K filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant acquisition or a downturn in the business could divert cash flow away from repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases each quarter.

**2. Catalyst Title: Strategic Acquisitions**
*   **Type:** M&A
*   **Description:** Continued execution of a disciplined acquisition strategy, focusing on acquiring funeral homes and cemeteries in key markets.
*   **Mechanism:** Acquisitions add to revenue and earnings, and synergies can be realized by integrating the new businesses into SCI's existing network.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with acquisitions likely to be announced over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: $100 million in acquisitions at a 10x EBITDA multiple, adding $10 million in EBITDA.
    *   Base Case: $180 million in acquisitions at a 10x EBITDA multiple, adding $18 million in EBITDA (consistent with 2024 spending).
    *   High Case: $250 million in acquisitions at a 10x EBITDA multiple, adding $25 million in EBITDA.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small-Medium (5-15%). The impact is dependent on the size and profitability of the acquired businesses.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. SCI has a long history of growth through acquisition, and the deathcare industry remains fragmented.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Availability of attractive acquisition targets at reasonable valuations.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Press releases announcing acquisitions and details of acquired businesses in SEC filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Overpaying for acquisitions or failing to successfully integrate them.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Look for announcements of acquisitions and analyze the purchase price and strategic fit.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Growth in Preneed Sales Backlog**
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description:** The continued growth of the preneed sales backlog, which represents a predictable stream of future revenue.
*   **Mechanism:** As the preneed backlog matures, it is recognized as revenue, providing a stable and growing source of income that is less susceptible to short-term fluctuations in the death rate.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing over the next 12-60 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: The backlog grows at 5% annually.
    *   Base Case: The backlog grows at 7% annually, reaching over $22 billion by the end of 2029 (based on a 7% CAGR from the $16.01 billion backlog at the end of 2024).
    *   High Case: The backlog grows at 10% annually.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). A larger and more predictable revenue stream should warrant a higher valuation multiple.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The aging of the baby boomer generation is a powerful demographic trend that should continue to drive preneed sales.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued effectiveness of the sales force and a stable economic environment.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** The size of the preneed backlog, as reported in quarterly and annual SEC filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant economic downturn could lead to a slowdown in preneed sales.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is a core part of the long-term investment thesis for SCI.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for SCI are predominantly positive, though likely to have a small to moderate impact on the share price. The ongoing share repurchase program and disciplined acquisition strategy provide a solid foundation for continued shareholder value creation. While there are no "company-making" near-term catalysts on the horizon, the steady execution of these initiatives should provide a positive tailwind for the stock over the next 0-12 months.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A sharp increase in interest rates:** This would increase the cost of debt for acquisitions and could negatively impact the valuation of the company's trust fund investments.
2.  **A major operational mishap or scandal:** The deathcare industry is highly sensitive to public perception, and any significant negative event could damage the company's reputation and brand.
3.  **A significant change in consumer preferences:** A rapid shift away from traditional funeral and burial services could negatively impact the company's revenue and profitability.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on this analysis, the recommendation for Service Corporation International is a **Buy** for long-term investors.

The expected upside from this and other catalysts is in the **10-20%** range over the next 12-60 months. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly growth of the preneed backlog, as reported in the company's SEC filings.
