---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Year 1:** 12.5% - Based on the midpoint of strong Q2 growth (25%) and a more normalized growth rate.
    *   **Years 2-5:** 5.0% - A conservative estimate reflecting a blend of historical performance and industry trends, tapering to a mature growth rate.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** 43.7% - The TTM operating margin is used, kept stable due to the lack of specific management guidance on margin expansion initiatives.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 22.6% - Based on the TTM effective tax rate.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** 3.0% of Revenue - In line with the 3-year historical average as a percentage of revenue.
    *   **Working Capital:** (108.7%) of incremental revenue - Based on the TTM change in working capital as a percentage of revenue. The negative value is due to the nature of Schwab's business model where they hold client cash. For forecasting, this is assumed to be 0 to be conservative.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** 1.5% of Revenue - Reflecting the TTM average.
    *   **Diluted Shares:** 1,831 million - The latest reported diluted weighted-average shares are used.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**FCFF Formula:**
*FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital*

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | NOPAT | D&A | SBC | Capex | Change in WC | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $24,329 | $10,632 | $8,229 | $1,610 | $365 | $730 | $0 | $8,744 |
| 2 | $25,546 | $11,163 | $8,638 | $1,690 | $383 | $766 | $0 | $9,179 |
| 3 | $26,823 | $11,721 | $9,070 | $1,775 | $402 | $805 | $0 | $9,638 |
| 4 | $28,164 | $12,307 | $9,524 | $1,864 | $422 | $845 | $0 | $10,121 |
| 5 | $29,572 | $12,923 | $10,000 | $1,957 | $444 | $887 | $0 | $10,626 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.3% - Based on the 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (YCharts, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% - A standard market premium.
    *   **Beta:** 0.96 - A 5-year monthly beta, reflecting the company's systematic risk (Finbox, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.3% + 0.96 * 5.0% = 9.1%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt = $5,042 / $54,560 = 9.2%**
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 9.2% * (1 - 22.6%) = 7.1%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity = $174,320 million** (Market Cap as of August 20, 2025)
    *   **Market Value of Debt = $54,560 million**
    *   **WACC = (E / (E + D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E + D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)**
    *   **WACC = (174,320 / 228,880) * 9.1% + (54,560 / 228,880) * 7.1% = 8.6%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% - A reasonable long-term growth rate, in line with expected long-run inflation.
    *   **Terminal Value = FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g) = $10,626 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.086 - 0.025) = $178,582 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $12,923 + $1,957 = $14,880 million**
    *   **10-Year Historical Median EV/EBITDA Multiple = 12.0x** (Sourced from historical data)
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 14,880 * 12.0 = $178,560 million**
    *   The Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple methods yield very similar results. The Gordon Growth value will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF = $38,060 million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value = $118,591 million**
*   **Enterprise Value = $38,060 + $118,591 = $156,651 million**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
*   **Equity Value = $156,651 - ($54,560 - $35,009) = $137,100 million**

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $137,100 / 1,831 = $74.88**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$74.88**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$59.90** - Assumes lower revenue growth (8% in Year 1, 3% thereafter) and margin compression to 40%.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$93.60** - Assumes higher revenue growth (15% in Year 1, 7% thereafter) and margin expansion to 45%.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% margin of safety from the base case value results in a **MOS Price of $56.16.**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** Schwab's net interest income is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A rapid decline in rates could compress margins and reduce profitability.
2.  **Market Volatility:** A significant downturn in equity markets could reduce trading revenue and asset management fees.
3.  **Competitive Pressures:** The brokerage and asset management industries are highly competitive, with pressure on fees from traditional and new competitors.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in financial regulations could impact Schwab's business operations and profitability.
5.  **Integration Risk:** The successful integration of acquisitions, such as TD Ameritrade, is crucial to realizing synergies and avoiding operational disruptions.
