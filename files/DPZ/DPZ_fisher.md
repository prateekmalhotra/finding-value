### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Domino's has significant growth potential through international expansion, with a projection to reach 31,000 stores worldwide by 2032. The global pizza market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 10.89% through 2032, which provides a substantial tailwind for the company's international growth. The company has a strong track record of adapting its menu to local tastes and has identified China and India as key markets for expansion. The company's "fortressing" strategy, which involves increasing store density in existing markets, is also expected to drive incremental sales and improve delivery times.
**Answer:** Yes
