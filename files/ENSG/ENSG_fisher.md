Company: The Ensign Group, Inc. (ENSG)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (April 30, 2025), Q1 2025 Earnings Release (April 29, 2025), and FY 2024 10-K public data (February 5, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Ensign Group operates in the post-acute healthcare services sector, primarily skilled nursing and senior living, which is poised for long-term growth due to powerful demographic tailwinds from the aging U.S. population. The industry is highly fragmented, providing a rich environment for Ensign's proven acquisition strategy. The company consistently grows by acquiring underperforming facilities and improving their clinical and financial results. In Q1 2025, the company noted it continued a "robust pace of new acquisitions" across its operating states, demonstrating a clear path for continued expansion.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's core strategy is growth through acquisition and operational improvement, which it describes as its "proven locally-led operating model." This is a continuous process of development, not a static product line. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, the CEO highlighted that improvements in occupancy and skilled mix in both mature (same-store) and maturing (transitioning) operations "highlight the enormous upside inherent in our portfolio." The company raised its 2025 revenue and earnings guidance, citing contributions from newly acquired operations as a key factor, demonstrating a commitment to this ongoing development process.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a healthcare services company, Ensign does not have R&D in the traditional sense of developing new technologies or patents. Its "R&D" is embedded in its operating model: identifying, acquiring, and integrating underperforming assets. The effectiveness is measured by the performance of these acquired facilities. The company consistently reports on the improving occupancy and skilled mix of its "transitioning" portfolio, which demonstrates the success of its process. For example, in Q1 2025, transitioning facilities' occupancy grew 5.0% over the prior year to 83.5%. This operational expertise is Ensign's form of R&D, and it is highly effective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE0rmGmfNbkym4ulN1pcnvL4s0nn8-1H5jDIze8zvxB9R3pcpqB1HQIgipazv8aacNYFXl_4eR6M5GRtfO4m6ZnHNl7NoLI9iJwmggZH4MX19uvnj9ssXuHWsOLd6RnF8WkvGX-f4MZGMtk2E3BmvtLjAP9Eno53c6z1i2dPUEzLmCF-7kM7BYYldTCe-HZdlFrrfQjaLmb2p4TbRcd0Ur1Y-nN5o93iRYOq6DIqNY079k1nj3ey78ea1TPM9wMGRTDHwgwWTzNJo2JihNbU99fLnYhQxlBwvW6MvW6yOFX](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.gmr-prod.secure.goog/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE0rmGmfNbkym4ulN1pcnvL4s0nn8-1H5jDIze8zvxB9R3pcpqB1HQIgipazv8aacNYFXl_4eR6M5GRtfO4m6ZnHNl7NoLI9iJwmggZH4MX19uvnj9ssXuHWsOLd6RnF8WkvGX-f4MZGMtk2E3BmvtLjAP9Eno53c6z1i2dPUEzLmCF-7kM7BYYldTCe-HZdlFrrfQjaLmb2p4TbRcd0Ur1Y-nN5o93iRYOq6DIqNY079k1nj3ey78ea1TPM9wMGRTDHwgwWTzNJo2JihNbU99fLnYhQxlBwvW6MvW6yOFX) (April 29, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Ensign's industry, "sales" translates to attracting patients, which is driven by clinical reputation, hospital relationships, and service quality. Key metrics like occupancy and skilled mix are indicators of sales effectiveness. In Q1 2025, Ensign achieved an "all-time high in same-store and transitioning occupancy," reaching 82.6% and 83.5%, respectively. The company also saw significant growth in higher-paying managed care census, which grew 8.9% in same-store and 15.6% in transitioning operations year-over-year, indicating a strong ability to attract profitable patient segments. This performance suggests a highly effective, decentralized "sales" function.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ensign has consistently demonstrated strong profitability. For Q1 2025, the company reported GAAP net income of $80.3 million, a 16.6% increase over the prior year, and adjusted net income of $89 million, an 18% increase. Annual revenue for 2024 was $4.26 billion with a trailing P/E ratio around 31, indicating strong investor confidence in its earnings power. While specific margin percentages require the full 10-Q, the consistent double-digit growth in net income points to healthy and expanding profit margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**(https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDRpskrcJ3sIBHZpNTeBieZ6IJVCo9G8VzNjnGN4Sf6_mwfB-EbNnwVqdldGIVXorBmX1xQbtGWetEz7fMqROQlB5tV2YrL1fQce7NgsPade7YWWS2TUzjUus1eEtw05uCUXd3jHDOfpa0jwjcXT-97d9oxN1uF0v7lNw-IUK70Q==) (April 30, 2025),(https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE-aS5PR0rW84DcBAYLPYqU6djWS4I-a_nxiPO2AZyDmEiLFHPXuxPytXLLLv7kJNH9lgaFJoZkz56IFvNj2uJ65IlmxpXZI3IjO5r-RB38Mx7-UFtnGj8K6VVVIU3UkOBgOv2RNbc7G7Vs5fj1eapfz20=) (August 24, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ensign's primary method for margin improvement is its disciplined operational strategy. The company improves margins by increasing occupancy and shifting the patient mix toward higher-reimbursement skilled nursing and managed care residents. In Q1 2025, same-store occupancy increased to 82.6% and skilled daily census grew by 7.6% over the prior year. This focus on clinical excellence and operational efficiency at the local level, combined with cost discipline during the integration of new facilities, is the core driver of margin maintenance and expansion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**(https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE0rmGmfNbkym4ulN1pcnvL4s0nn8-1H5jDIze8zvxB9R3pcpqB1HQIgipazv8aacNYFXl_4eR6M5GRtfO4m6ZnHNl7NoLI9iJwmggZH4MX19uvnj9ssXuHWsOLd6RnF8WkvGX-f4MZGMtk2E3BmvtLjAP9Eno53c6z1i2dPUEzLmCF-7kM7BYYldTCe-HZdlFrrfQjaLmb2p4TbRcd0Ur1Y-nN5o93iRYOq6DIqNY079k1nj3ey78ea1TPM9wMGRTDHwgwWTzNJo2JihNbU99fLnYhQxlBwvW6MvW6yOFX) (April 29, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific, recent data available in the provided sources regarding employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations to make a definitive judgment. While the company's decentralized model empowers local leaders, which can lead to better relations, the healthcare services industry as a whole faces significant labor challenges. Without concrete positive evidence from filings or reputable third-party sources on key metrics like staff retention or satisfaction, it is not possible to confirm "outstanding" relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** Not available.

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The long tenure of the executive team and the consistent strategy suggest stable and effective executive relations. Barry R. Port has been CEO since 2019, and the company's co-founder, Christopher Christensen, remains Executive Chairman, indicating continuity. The Q1 2025 earnings call presents a unified message from the CEO, CFO, and CIO, demonstrating a collaborative leadership team executing a consistent, long-term strategy. There are no public reports of significant executive turnover or internal conflicts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDRpskrcJ3sIBHZpNTeBieZ6IJVCo9G8VzNjnGN4Sf6_mwfB-EbNnwVqdldGIVXorBmX1xQbtGWetEz7fMqROQlB5tV2YrL1fQce7NgsPade7YWWS2TUzjUus1eEtw05uCUXd3jHDOfpa0jwjcXT-97d9oxN1uF0v7lNw-IUK70Q==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDRpskrcJ3sIBHZpNTeBieZ6IJVCo9G8VzNjnGN4Sf6_mwfB-EbNnwVqdldGIVXorBmX1xQbtGWetEz7fMqROQlB5tV2YrL1fQce7NgsPade7YWWS2TUzjUus1eEtw05uCUXd3jHDOfpa0jwjcXT-97d9oxN1uF0v7lNw-IUK70Q==) (April 30, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ensign’s operating model is predicated on management depth. The company is a holding company with a decentralized structure where local leaders ("CEOs" of their facilities) are empowered with significant autonomy. This structure requires a deep bench of operational talent. The earnings calls frequently feature Chad Keetch, the Chief Investment Officer, and Suzanne Snapper, the CFO, alongside the CEO, showcasing a breadth of leadership at the corporate level that supports the field operators. This structure mitigates key-person risk and is fundamental to their growth strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDRpskrcJ3sIBHZpNTeBieZ6IJVCo9G8VzNjnGN4Sf6_mwfB-EbNnwVqdldGIVXorBmX1xQbtGWetEz7fMqROQlB5tV2YrL1fQce7NgsPade7YWWS2TUzjUus1eEtw05uCUXd3jHDOfpa0jwjcXT-97d9oxN1uF0v7lNw-IUK70Q==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDRpskrcJ3sIBHZpNTeBieZ6IJVCo9G8VzNjnGN4Sf6_mwfB-EbNnwVqdldGIVXorBmX1xQbtGWetEz7fMqROQlB5tV2YrL1fQce7NgsPade7YWWS2TUzjUus1eEtw05uCUXd3jHDOfpa0jwjcXT-97d9oxN1uF0v7lNw-IUK70Q==) (April 30, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The independent auditor's report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, included in the 10-K filing, expressed an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. This finding from a registered public accounting firm is a strong indicator of effective accounting controls. The company also provides detailed segment reporting, breaking out performance for "same facilities," "transitioning facilities," and "newly acquired facilities," which demonstrates robust internal cost analysis and tracking. There is no history of major restatements or control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFC4wadfzC9PtnbxY55m5_aglicKFYVHofrHlQKKcgDQ9QmuvLTS1nfLOsKOcBwc9syCoXftcEmzyJu4-8TlkNotDWGBiBI4-gKZ0A2KGHsGZizmCorABN6B1LA-tchXj6Wa_c9z9C3i6I-G4ThJpmm7BkLxGruC_K8-GFWpmjWoFy4FIF3Qge1nRPsyQb7YYXvl7DrU_-eAhVnh_WJHeqZSw==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFC4wadfzC9PtnbxY55m5_aglicKFYVHofrHlQKKcgDQ9QmuvLTS1nfLOsKOcBwc9syCoXftcEmzyJu4-8TlkNotDWGBiBI4-gKZ0A2KGHsGZizmCorABN6B1LA-tchXj6Wa_c9z9C3i6I-G4ThJpmm7BkLxGruC_K8-GFWpmjWoFy4FIF3Qge1nRPsyQb7YYXvl7DrU_-eAhVnh_WJHeqZSw==) (February 5, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Ensign's key competitive advantage is its decentralized operating model and its expertise in real estate. The company empowers local leaders to make decisions, fostering an entrepreneurial culture that is difficult for more centralized competitors to replicate. Furthermore, Ensign has a real estate subsidiary, Standard Bearer, which gives it significant flexibility in acquiring and managing its properties. In Q1 2025, Standard Bearer generated $28.4 million in rental revenue, demonstrating its scale and financial contribution. This combination of operational and real estate strategy is a unique and powerful advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes a long-range perspective focused on disciplined, sustainable growth. Their acquisition strategy inherently involves short-term costs and lower initial margins from new facilities, which is accepted in exchange for long-term accretion as the operations are improved. The consistent raising of annual guidance, as seen in the Q1 2025 report where they increased full-year EPS guidance to $6.22-$6.38, reflects confidence in their ability to manage this trade-off effectively. The 22-year history of increasing the dividend further underscores a focus on long-term, sustainable shareholder returns.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong financial position to fund its growth. As of March 31, 2025, Ensign held $282.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $72.2 million in cash flow from operations for the quarter. Management funds its acquisitions through cash flow and available credit facilities. The company also recently completed a $20 million stock repurchase program, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and a belief that its shares were undervalued, the opposite of a company planning dilutive financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**(https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDRpskrcJ3sIBHZpNTeBieZ6IJVCo9G8VzNjnGN4Sf6_mwfB-EbNnwVqdldGIVXorBmX1xQbtGWetEz7fMqROQlB5tV2YrL1fQce7NgsPade7YWWS2TUzjUus1eEtw05uCUXd3jHDOfpa0jwjcXT-97d9oxN1uF0v7lNw-IUK70Q==) (April 30, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's communications appear transparent and consistent. They provide detailed metrics on different facility cohorts (same-store, transitioning, new) which gives investors a clear view of the business drivers. In the Q1 2025 earnings call transcript, they provide specific numbers on occupancy, skilled mix, and revenue growth. While the period reviewed has been overwhelmingly positive, the granularity of their reporting and the consistency of their message across calls suggests a culture of transparency. There is no evidence of them avoiding difficult topics in recent history.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**(https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFDRpskrcJ3sIBHZpNTeBieZ6IJVCo9G8VzNjnGN4Sf6_mwfB-EbNnwVqdldGIVXorBmX1xQbtGWetEz7fMqROQlB5tV2YrL1fQce7NgsPade7YWWS2TUzjUus1eEtw05uCUXd3jHDOfpa0jwjcXT-97d9oxN1uF0v7lNw-IUK70Q==) (April 30, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of public records and search results does not reveal any recent, major legal or regulatory actions that would call the integrity of the current senior management team into question. The company operates in a highly litigious and regulated industry, and legal proceedings are a normal part of business, as disclosed in all 10-K filings. However, there are no indicators of significant fraud, insider dealing scandals, or major governance red flags. The company has received unqualified audit opinions on its financial statements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**(https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFC4wadfzC9PtnbxY55m5_aglicKFYVHofrHlQKKcgDQ9QmuvLTS1nfLOsKOcBwc9syCoXftcEmzyJu4-8TlkNotDWGBiBI4-gKZ0A2KGHsGZizmCorABN6B1LA-tchXj6Wa_c9z9C3i6I-G4ThJpmm7BkLxGruC_K8-GFWpmjWoFy4FIF3Qge1nRPsyQb7YYXvl7DrU_-eAhVnh_WJHeqZSw==) (February 5, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
The Ensign Group scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong position in a growing market and a proven, scalable operating model. The company's primary strengths are its decentralized management structure, which fosters accountability and local expertise, and its disciplined acquisition strategy focused on turning around underperforming assets. This is supported by a robust financial position and a management team with a clear long-term vision. The main negative is the lack of specific, verifiable data on labor relations, a critical factor in a service-intensive industry. Over the next 12–24 months, the score could be most impacted by the pace and success of its acquisitions and their subsequent integration. A significant slowdown in acquiring new facilities or a failure to improve the margins of its "transitioning" portfolio would challenge the growth narrative. To flip the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes," the company would need to proactively disclose metrics such as employee turnover rates, satisfaction scores, or other concrete evidence of superior personnel management.

fisher score is 14 / 15
