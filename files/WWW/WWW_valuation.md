### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Year 1 Revenue Growth** | 5.0% | No explicit annual guidance. Assumed a conservative growth rate reflecting strong Q2 performance (11.6% YoY) but tapering for the full year, given the dynamic environment mentioned by management. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025). |
| **Years 2-5 Revenue Growth** | 3.0% | Reflects a stabilized growth rate for a mature company in a turnaround, slightly above long-term inflation. |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin** | 8.3% | Based on management's Q3 guidance. Held flat as no specific long-term margin expansion initiatives were cited to justify further increases. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025). |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 15.0% | Normalized rate based on recent TTM effective tax rate (13.3%) and FY2024 (16.4%), accounting for historical volatility. (StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement, August 21, 2025). |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula:** Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in Working Capital. This metric is used as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,912.5 | $1,969.8 | $2,028.9 | $2,089.8 | $2,152.5 |
| EBIT (8.3% of Revenue) | $158.7 | $163.5 | $168.4 | $173.5 | $178.7 |
| Tax (15.0%) | ($23.8) | ($24.5) | ($25.3) | ($26.0) | ($26.8) |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | **Rf + Beta * ERP** |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.29% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. (YCharts, August 20, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.00% | Standard premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta (Î²) | 1.76 | Average of 24-month beta (1.77) and reported beta (1.74). Justified by high volatility during a corporate turnaround. (Seeking Alpha, MarketBeat, August 21, 2025). |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **13.09%** | **4.29% + 1.76 * 5.00%** |
| | |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Cost of Debt (Kd) | 4.98% | TTM Interest Expense / Average Total Debt. |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 4.24% | 4.98% * (1 - 15.0%) |
| | |
| **WACC** | | **(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-t))** |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $2,324M | 81.0M shares * $28.69/share (as of Aug 20, 2025). |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $709M | Book value of debt is used as a proxy. (StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet, June 28, 2025). |
| **WACC** | **10.97%** | **($2324/$3033 * 13.09%) + ($709/$3033 * 4.24%)** |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Method:** Gordon Growth Model
*   **Formula:** Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0%. This is a conservative rate, capped at the long-run inflation expectation and suitable for a mature company.
*   **Calculation:** ($124.9M * (1 + 0.02)) / (10.97% - 2.0%) = **$1,421.3M**

*   **Cross-Check:** Exit Multiple Method
*   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $178.7M (EBIT) + $30.1M (D&A) = $208.8M
*   **Assumed EV/EBITDA Multiple:** 7.5x. A conservative multiple in line with historical averages for footwear/apparel companies, accounting for WWW's turnaround status.
*   **Calculation:** $208.8M * 7.5 = **$1,566.0M**

*Decision: The Gordon Growth method yields a lower (more conservative) terminal value, which will be used.*

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (USD Millions) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5) | $440.0 | Sum of discounted FCFFs at 10.97% WACC. |
| PV of Terminal Value | $842.1 | $1,421.3M / (1 + 10.97%)^5 |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$1,282.1** | **$440.0 + $842.1** |
| Less: Net Debt | ($567.5) | Total Debt ($708.5M) - Cash ($141.0M). (StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet, June 28, 2025). |
| **Equity Value** | **$714.6** | **$1,282.1 - $567.5** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Metric | Value per Share (USD) | Calculation / Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$8.82** | **$714.6M / 81.0M Diluted Shares** |
| **Low/Bear Case** | $5.50 | Assumes 0% revenue growth and 6.5% EBIT margins, reflecting execution failure. |
| **High/Bull Case** | $13.50 | Assumes 7% initial revenue growth and sustained 9.5% EBIT margins from successful brand revitalization. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$6.17** | **$8.82 * (1 - 0.30)** |

### **Risk Notes**

The base-case valuation is exposed to several key risks. First, the **turnaround execution risk** is high; failure to stabilize core brands like Merrell and Saucony or improve profitability could invalidate margin assumptions. Second, as a consumer discretionary company, WWW is sensitive to **macroeconomic headwinds** that could dampen consumer spending on footwear and apparel. Third, the footwear industry is highly competitive, posing a constant risk of **fashion trends and brand relevance** shifting away from WWW's portfolio. Finally, **supply chain disruptions and input cost volatility** remain a persistent threat to gross margins.

final answer is 8.82 $
