**Synthesis:**
Graphic Packaging Holding Company scores very highly on Fisher's 15-point checklist. The company's strengths lie in its strong market position in the growing sustainable packaging sector, its commitment to innovation, and its solid financial performance. The company appears to have a stable and experienced management team with a long-term strategic focus. The key variables that could impact this score in the next 12-24 months include the pace of consumer adoption of plastic-alternative packaging, the successful integration of any future acquisitions, and the ability to maintain margins in a potentially volatile raw material cost environment. A significant downturn in the global economy could also impact demand for consumer goods and, consequently, packaging. To turn any of the "Yes" answers to a "No", there would need to be a significant negative event, such as a major product recall, a significant labor dispute, a major accounting issue, or a strategic misstep that would call into question the judgment of the management team.

fisher score is 15 / 15
