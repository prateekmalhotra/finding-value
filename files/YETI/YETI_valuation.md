### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-Y5)** | **3.0% annually.** This reflects a conservative view based on recent performance (Q2 2025 sales decreased 4%) and cautious consumer spending, offset by international growth and new product introductions. | (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 7, 2025) |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **13.0% of Revenue.** This is slightly below the TTM operating margin and reflects a stable margin path, assuming that cost efficiencies from supply chain diversification are reinvested into marketing and R&D to support growth. | (YETI Holdings, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 24, 2025) |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **25.0%.** Aligns with the effective tax rate reported for fiscal year 2024. | (YETI Holdings, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 24, 2025) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **2.8%.** Based on the midpoint of management's 2025 guidance ($50M) as a percentage of TTM revenue. | (Q2 2025 Earnings Release, August 7, 2025) |
| **Change in WC as % of Revenue Change** | **10.0%.** Based on a historical average, reflecting efficient working capital management. | (Author's analysis of historical filings) |
| **Stock-Based Comp. as % of Revenue**| **2.2%.** Based on the TTM period. | (YETI Holdings, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 24, 2025) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**FCFF Formula**: EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,857.2 | $1,912.9 | $1,970.3 | $2,029.4 | $2,090.3 |
| EBIT | $241.4 | $248.7 | $256.1 | $263.8 | $271.7 |
| NOPAT | $181.1 | $186.5 | $192.1 | $197.9 | $203.8 |
| Add: D&A | $49.5 | $51.0 | $52.5 | $54.1 | $55.7 |
| Less: SBC | $40.9 | $42.1 | $43.3 | $44.6 | $46.0 |
| Less: Capex | $52.0 | $53.6 | $55.2 | $56.8 | $58.5 |
| Less: ∆ in WC | $5.4 | $5.6 | $5.7 | $5.9 | $6.1 |
| **FCFF** | **$132.3** | **$136.2** | **$140.4** | **$144.7** | **$148.9** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk-Free Rate (Rf)** | **4.30%** | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield. (Trading Economics, August 21, 2025) |
| **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)** | **5.5%** | Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| **Beta (β)** | **1.84** | 5-year monthly beta, reflecting higher volatility than the market, consistent with a consumer discretionary brand. (MarketBeat, August 20, 2025) |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **14.42%** | Formula: `Rf + β * ERP` = 4.30% + 1.84 * 5.5% |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **7.09%** | Based on the weighted average interest rate for borrowings. (YETI Holdings, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 24, 2025) |
| **Market Cap (E)** | $2,810M | (TradingView, August 21, 2025) |
| **Net Debt (D)** | ($277.3M) | Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents. Since YETI has more cash than debt, net debt is negative, so for WACC purposes, we will assume a debt weight of 0%. |
| **WACC** | **14.42%** | Formula: `(E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1 - T)`. Since Net Debt is negative, the cost of capital is effectively the Cost of Equity. |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method**: A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   **Calculation**: `(Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)` = `($148.9M * 1.025) / (14.42% - 2.5%)` = **$1,282.4M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**:
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $271.7M + $55.7M = $327.4M
    *   Assume a conservative 5-year historical median EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.0x.
    *   **Calculation**: `Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple` = `$327.4M * 8.0` = **$2,619.2M**
*   **Conclusion**: There is a significant discrepancy. The lower, more conservative Gordon Growth terminal value of **$1,282.4M** will be used for the valuation.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending**: As a premium brand, YETI is susceptible to downturns in consumer discretionary spending, which can be impacted by inflation and economic uncertainty. The recent 4% decrease in Q2 2025 sales highlights this risk.
2.  **Competition**: The market for outdoor and recreation products is highly competitive, with numerous brands offering similar products at lower price points. This could lead to pricing pressure and market share erosion.
3.  **Brand & Fashion Risk**: YETI's success is heavily tied to its brand image. Changes in consumer preferences or a failure to innovate could diminish the brand's premium status and negatively impact sales.
4.  **Execution Risk**: The company's growth relies on successful new product launches and continued international expansion. Any missteps in execution could hinder growth prospects.
5.  **High Beta**: The stock's beta of 1.84 indicates a higher level of volatility compared to the overall market, suggesting greater risk during market downturns.
