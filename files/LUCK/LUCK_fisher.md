**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lucky Strike Entertainment is a leader in location-based entertainment, operating over 350 centers across North America.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a location-based entertainment company, traditional R&D spending is not a primary focus. However, the company invests in new concepts and technologies to enhance the customer experience. The company's "proven business model" emphasizes "conversions and upgrading of locations to more upscale entertainment concepts offering a broader range of offerings." The effectiveness of this is demonstrated by the continued growth through acquisitions and the rollout of new food and beverage menus.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024044992/bowl-20240929.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a strong ability to drive both organic and inorganic growth. Same-store sales have remained stable, and the company has successfully integrated numerous acquisitions. The growth in group events, a key sales focus, also points to a strong sales organization. The company is also investing in its event sales teams to support its growing business.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, the company's gross profit margin was 27.2%, a decrease from 32.3% in the prior year.

**Answer:** No

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is implementing several initiatives to improve margins, including optimizing staffing levels, and rolling out new premium food and beverage options. It is also leveraging technology such as self-service kiosks and online reservations to create a leaner staffing model. These actions are designed to offset rising labor and operational costs.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2024, only 65 of the company's 11,374 employees were members of a union. The company states that it believes its employee relations are satisfactory and reports no work stoppages.
**Answer:** Yes

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a proven management team with extensive experience in the location-based entertainment industry. The company also highlights its team of skilled and loyal managers at each of its locations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a public company, Lucky Strike Entertainment is subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which mandate the maintenance of effective internal controls over financial reporting. The company's financial statements are audited by a registered public accounting firm.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lucky Strike's scale as one of the world's largest operators of location-based entertainment provides significant competitive advantages, including brand recognition and economies of scale in purchasing and marketing. The company's ownership of the Professional Bowlers Association (PBA) also provides a unique marketing platform and reinforces its brand as a leader in the bowling industry. The recent large-scale real estate transaction with VICI Properties, converting leases to ownership for 38 locations, provides long-term stability and financial flexibility.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024020461/bowl-20240331.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy of reinvesting in the business through acquisitions, new builds, and conversions, as highlighted in its recent financial reports, indicates a focus on long-term growth. The significant capital expenditures on upgrading existing locations and acquiring new ones, sometimes at the expense of short-term margins, further supports this conclusion. The recent $432.9 million real estate transaction with VICI was explicitly intended to provide liquidity to "accelerate new builds, deploy capital into acquisitions and conversions, return value to shareholders, pay down debt, and for general corporate purposes."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024020461/bowl-20240331.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a share repurchase program in place, having repurchased over 22 million shares in fiscal 2024. It also recently increased its revolving credit facility. The VICI transaction also provided a significant infusion of capital. These factors suggest that the company has sufficient access to capital to fund its growth initiatives without resorting to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024020461/bowl-20240331.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024044992/bowl-20240929.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed quarterly and annual reports, including a Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which outlines both positive and negative trends affecting the business. For example, the company openly discusses the reasons for the decrease in same-store sales and the increase in costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024020461/bowl-20240331.htm']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided documents to suggest a lack of integrity on the part of management. The company is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC and the NYSE. However, a group of claims of age discrimination were filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) between 2016 and 2019. In 2022, the EEOC issued determinations of probable cause as to the majority of the charges. The EEOC has since issued Closure Notices for these claims and will not bring litigation against the company.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024020461/bowl-20240331.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1840572/000162828024039546/bowl-20240630.htm']

---
**Synthesis:**
Lucky Strike Entertainment scores well on many of Fisher's points, demonstrating a strong commitment to growth through acquisitions and the modernization of its facilities. The company has a dominant market position, a proven management team, and a long-range outlook. However, declining profit margins are a concern, as is the history of age discrimination claims. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to successfully integrate its recent acquisitions and demonstrate a return to margin growth. A successful resolution of any outstanding legal matters would also improve the score. To flip the "No" on profit margins to a "Yes," the company would need to demonstrate sustained margin improvement through its various initiatives. The integrity score would require a clean record over a longer period.
