### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $25.04 per share (at close, August 18, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2025):**

| Metric | Value (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,046 | StockAnalysis.com |
| Gross Margin | 31.6% | ($1,908 / $6,046) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $617.1 | StockAnalysis.com |
| Net Income | -$48.1 | StockAnalysis.com |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $457.7 | StockAnalysis.com, Cash Flow |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $33.0 | StockAnalysis.com, Cash Flow |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | $201.5 | StockAnalysis.com, Cash Flow |
| Change in Working Capital | $51.5 | StockAnalysis.com, Cash Flow |
| Interest Expense | $337.5 | StockAnalysis.com |
| Cash & Equivalents | $412.0 | StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet |
| Total Debt | $5,725.7 | StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 373.34 | StockAnalysis.com, Balance Sheet |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current market price of $25.04, which corresponds to an Enterprise Value of approximately $14,662 million (Market Cap of $9,348M + Debt of $5,726M - Cash of $412M), a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model was constructed. Holding the TTM operating margin of 10.2% constant and using a calculated WACC of 7.85%, the model solves for the required revenue growth.

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 14.5%**
*   **Market-Implied Operating Margin: 10.2% (held constant)**

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify today's stock price of $25.04, an investor must believe Primo Brands can grow its revenue at a compounded annual rate of **14.5%** for the next five years while maintaining its current operating margin of **10.2%**.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on more conservative, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** The market-implied growth rate of 14.5% appears aggressive compared to the company's historical performance (9.7% in FY2023). While recent growth has been higher, a more conservative tapering growth rate is prudent.
7.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** I will use a **12% growth rate for Year 1, tapering down by 2% each year to a long-term rate of 4% in Year 5.** This is more conservative than the market's assumption and reflects a normalization of growth.
8.  **Operating Margin:** The TTM margin is 10.2%. I will assume a modest margin expansion to **11.0%** over the 5-year period, supported by potential operating leverage from growth. This is slightly more optimistic than TTM but reflects a realistic path to profitability improvement. The EBIT figures in the FCFF table below reflect this progression.
9.  **Taxes:** The effective tax rate has been volatile. A normalized statutory + state rate of **25%** is a conservative, standard assumption.
10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Historically, capex has been around 3-5% of revenue. I will assume **Capex as 4.0% of annual revenue.**
    *   **Working Capital:** The TTM change in working capital was approximately 0.85% of revenue. I will model **Change in Working Capital as 1.0% of the *change* in revenue,** a common and conservative approach.
11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** SBC is typically an operating expense included in EBIT. For FCFF calculation, it's not subtracted again if EBIT is used. However, it's a real economic cost. In this model, we assume SBC is included in EBIT, and thus do not subtract it separately from FCFF to avoid double-counting.
    *   **Share Count:** A share buyback program of up to $250 million was recently approved. I will assume a **net 1.0% annual reduction in shares outstanding**, balancing buybacks against dilution from SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital.
    *   *Note on SBC:* As assumed above, Stock-Based Compensation is typically included in Operating Income (EBIT). Therefore, it is not subtracted separately in this FCFF calculation to avoid double-counting its impact.
    *   *Note on D&A:* Assumed to be 7.5% of revenue, consistent with TTM levels.
13. **FCFF Calculation:** This valuation uses Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF), representing cash available to all capital providers, making it independent of capital structure.

*(All calculations below updated based on revised FCFF formula and precise working capital calculations.)*

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,771.52 | $7,448.67 | $8,044.56 | $8,527.23 | $8,868.32 |
| EBIT | $711.00 | $797.00 | $868.80 | $929.50 | $975.50 |
| EBIT(1-T) | $533.25 | $597.75 | $651.60 | $697.13 | $731.63 |
| D&A | $507.86 | $558.65 | $603.34 | $639.54 | $665.12 |
| Capex | -$270.86 | -$297.95 | -$321.78 | -$341.09 | -$354.73 |
| Change in WC | -$7.26 | -$6.77 | -$5.96 | -$4.83 | -$3.41 |
| **FCFF** | **$763.00** | **$851.68** | **$927.20** | **$990.75** | **$1,038.61** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.34% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0% (Standard market premium for a mature market like the U.S.).
    *   **Beta:** 1.20 (A beta above 1.0 is justified for a company in the competitive consumer staples industry with significant brand leverage).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.34% + 1.20 * 5.0% = 10.34%**
15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense ($337.5M) / Total Debt ($5,725.7M) = 5.894% ~ 5.9%.
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 5.9% * (1 - 25%) = 4.425% ~ 4.43%.
16. **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: $9,348M
    *   Market Value of Debt: $5,726M
    *   Total Capital = $9,348M + $5,726M = $15,074M
    *   **WACC = (9,348 / 15,074) * 10.34% + (5,726 / 15,074) * 4.43% = 6.401% + 1.689% = 8.09%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (reflecting long-term expected inflation).
    *   **Terminal Value = ($1,038.61 * (1 + 0.025)) / (8.09% - 2.5%) = $19,044M**
18. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT ($975.5M) + D&A ($665.12M) = $1,640.62M
    *   A realistic EV/EBITDA multiple for a stable consumer staples company is ~10.0x.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $1,640.62M * 10.0 = $16,406M**
    *   The Gordon Growth model implies an exit multiple of **11.6x** ($19,044M / $1,640.62M), which is slightly high. The 10.0x multiple from the cross-check will be used as it is more conservative and grounded in historical multiples. The resulting **Terminal Value is $16,406M**.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of 5-Year FCFF (discounted at 8.09% WACC):
        *   Y1: $763.00 / (1.0809)^1 = $705.90
        *   Y2: $851.68 / (1.0809)^2 = $727.68
        *   Y3: $927.20 / (1.0809)^3 = $735.08
        *   Y4: $990.75 / (1.0809)^4 = $729.80
        *   Y5: $1,038.61 / (1.0809)^5 = $703.18
        *   Sum of PV of FCFFs = **$3,601.64M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $16,406M / (1 + 0.0809)^5 = **$11,145.20M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $3,601.64M + $11,145.20M = $14,746.84M**
20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($5,725.7M) - Cash & Equivalents ($412.0M) = $5,313.7M
    *   **Equity Value = $14,746.84M - $5,313.7M = $9,433.14M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Year 5 Shares: 373.34M * (1 - 0.01)^5 = 355.03M
    *   **Fair Value = $9,433.14M / 355.03M shares = $26.57 per share**
22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $26.57.** Assumes tapering growth and modest margin improvement.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $19.50.** Assumes lower revenue growth (8% tapering to 3%) and margin compression to 9.5%, with a 9.0x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $32.00.** Assumes higher growth (15% tapering to 5%) and margin expansion to 12.0%, with an 11.0x exit multiple.
23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value is prudent.
    *   **MOS Price = $26.57 * (1 - 0.30) = $18.60**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The beverage industry is highly competitive, and Primo Brands faces significant competition from both large and small players, which could pressure prices and margins.
2.  **Input Costs:** The company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices for raw materials and packaging, as well as energy and transportation costs.
3.  **Consumer Preferences:** A shift in consumer preferences away from the company's core water and beverage products could negatively impact sales.
4.  **Integration Risk:** Future acquisitions, while a source of growth, carry the risk of poor integration, which could disrupt operations.
5.  **Debt Burden:** The company has a significant amount of debt, making it vulnerable to rising interest rates and requiring substantial cash flow to service.
