**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast has a demonstrated history of expanding its platform beyond its initial point-of-sale offering to include online ordering, marketing, payroll, and capital services.

---
Synthesis: Toast, Inc. scores well on Fisher's checklist, with strong positives in its large market opportunity, commitment to innovation, effective sales organization, and experienced management team. The company's integrated platform provides a significant competitive advantage in the restaurant technology industry. The primary area for improvement is profitability, as the company is still in a high-growth phase and has not yet achieved consistent GAAP profitability. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to demonstrate a clear and sustainable path to profitability. A significant improvement in profit margins would likely flip the "No" on point 5 to a "Yes." Additionally, more concrete evidence of outstanding labor and personnel relations would be needed to change the "No" on point 7.

fisher score is 13 / 15
