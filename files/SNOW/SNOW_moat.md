### Dimension Analysis

**1) Network Effects**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake's network effects are growing, particularly through its data sharing capabilities which allow customers to securely exchange data with partners and customers, increasing the value of the platform for all participants. The addition of new customers and datasets makes the platform more attractive to new and existing users. However, the network effect is still developing and is not as strong as more mature platforms.
- **Evidence:**
    - Customers like CloudZero leverage hundreds of powerful, active data sharing connections to securely exchange data with their partners and customers, driving value across the ecosystem. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**2) Switching Costs**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake benefits from high switching costs due to the technical complexity and cost of migrating large-scale data warehouses. Customers build complex data pipelines, analytics, and applications on top of Snowflake, making it difficult to switch to a competitor without significant disruption and expense. The net revenue retention rate is a strong indicator of customer lock-in.
- **Evidence:**
    - Net revenue retention was a very healthy 124%. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
    - Two large customers signed contracts worth over $100 million each in Q1 2026. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 4 / 5

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
- **Reasoning:** While Snowflake's architecture is designed for efficiency, the company does not have a clear, sustainable cost advantage over its primary competitors, the major cloud providers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft), who control the underlying infrastructure and can offer bundled services at a lower cost. Snowflake's gross margins are healthy but not indicative of a significant structural cost advantage.
- **Evidence:**
    - Non-GAAP product gross margin was 75.7% in Q1 2026. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake has built a strong brand in the data warehousing and cloud data platform market, known for its ease of use and performance. The company continues to innovate and has a growing portfolio of products and features. However, it does not possess patents or other intellectual property that provide a long-term, impenetrable barrier to competition.
- **Evidence:**
    - In Q1 2026, Snowflake brought over 125 product capabilities to market, a 100% increase over Q1 of the previous year. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake leverages the global infrastructure of the major cloud providers, giving it a massive distribution footprint without the need for significant capital investment in data centers. The company is also expanding its go-to-market operations to increase its reach.
- **Evidence:**
    - Snowflake is expanding its addressable market with the launch of Snowflake Public Sector Inc. and a recent Department of Defense Impact Level provisional authorization. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**6) Data Advantage**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake's platform is designed to help customers get more value out of their own data, and the data sharing capabilities create a powerful data network effect. The more data that is shared and available on the platform, the more valuable it becomes for all users.
- **Evidence:**
    - Dentsu, a global marketing agency, consolidated data in Snowflake and now uses Snowflake Data Clean Rooms to help global brands securely combine customer data. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 4 / 5

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake is building a strong ecosystem of partners, including technology partners, service partners, and data providers. The Snowflake Marketplace allows customers to access third-party data and services, which enhances the value of the platform. However, the ecosystem is still maturing compared to those of the major cloud providers.
- **Evidence:**
    - An expanded partnership with Microsoft was announced to host OpenAI models on Microsoft Azure. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake is pursuing and obtaining certifications and authorizations that are necessary to serve customers in highly regulated industries, such as the public sector and defense. These can act as a barrier to entry for competitors who have not made similar investments.
- **Evidence:**
    - Snowflake recently received a Department of Defense Impact Level provisional authorization, allowing it to serve the national security community. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake's business model is not capital intensive in the traditional sense, as it relies on the infrastructure of the major cloud providers. This allows the company to scale efficiently but also means it does not have a moat based on unique, hard-to-replicate physical assets.
- **Evidence:**
    - The company ended Q1 2026 with $4.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
- **Reasoning:** Snowflake has strong revenue visibility due to its consumption-based model and the increasing use of multi-year contracts. The company's remaining performance obligations (RPO) provide a clear picture of future revenue.
- **Evidence:**
    - Remaining performance obligations totaled $6.7 billion in Q1 2026, with year-over-year growth of 34%. (Snowflake Inc. (SNOW) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, May 21, 2025).
- **Score:** 5 / 5

### Aggregation
- **Weighted Score Calculation:** (3 * 0.18) + (4 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02) = 0.54 + 0.60 + 0.30 + 0.36 + 0.30 + 0.40 + 0.24 + 0.12 + 0.08 + 0.10 = **3.04**
- **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 30.4 / 100

### Mapping
- **Weighted Score to Moat Rating:** A weighted score of 30.4 falls within the 30 <= Weighted < 50 range, which maps to a moat rating of 2.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is approximately 7-10 years. This is based on the high switching costs and growing network effects, which should provide a durable competitive advantage for the medium term. However, the intense competition from the major cloud providers and the rapid pace of innovation in the data and AI market could erode this advantage over the long term.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Increased Competition from Hyperscalers:** Amazon, Microsoft, and Google could leverage their infrastructure and existing customer relationships to offer more integrated and lower-cost data platforms, reducing Snowflake's market share.
2.  **Technological Disruption:** A new technology or architectural approach to data management and analytics could emerge that is significantly more efficient or powerful than Snowflake's, making the platform obsolete.
3.  **Data Gravity Shifts:** If customers begin to consolidate their data and applications on a single cloud provider's platform, it could become more difficult for Snowflake to attract and retain customers who want to use a multi-cloud or cloud-agnostic solution.

### KPIs to Monitor
-   Net Revenue Retention Rate
-   Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) Growth
-   Customer Growth Rate
-   Product Revenue Growth Rate
-   Gross Margin
-   Adoption of new products and features (e.g., Snowpark, Cortex)
-   Market share relative to hyperscaler data platforms
-   Customer concentration

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Snowflake has established a solid competitive position in the cloud data platform market, driven by high switching costs, a growing network effect through data sharing, and a strong brand. The company's impressive growth and high net revenue retention rate are testaments to the value it provides to its customers. However, the intense competition from the major cloud providers, who own the underlying infrastructure, poses a significant long-term threat. A decline in the net revenue retention rate or a slowdown in customer growth would be key indicators that the company's moat is eroding.

moat rating is 2 / 5
