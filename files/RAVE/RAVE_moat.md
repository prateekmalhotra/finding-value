### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Rave Restaurant Group operates in the traditional restaurant franchising industry, which does not benefit from network effects. The value of a Pizza Inn or Pie Five restaurant to a customer does not increase as more customers frequent the same or other locations. The business model is a classic linear one, not a networked platform.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The business is described as franchising and licensing of pizza restaurants under the "Pizza Inn" and "Pie Five" trademarks. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Switching costs are low for customers, who can easily choose another pizza restaurant. For franchisees, there are moderate switching costs in the form of initial franchise fees and the capital investment in the restaurant build-out. However, these are typical for the industry and do not create a strong lock-in effect, as evidenced by the number of restaurant closures.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Franchise license fees are amortized over the term of the franchise agreement, which typically ranges from five to 20 years. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
*   There was a net decrease of 18 domestic Pizza Inn units and 7 domestic Pie Five units in fiscal 2024. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Rave does not demonstrate a significant cost advantage. While the company leverages volume purchasing for its franchisees, this is a standard practice in the franchise restaurant industry. There is no evidence of proprietary low-cost inputs or a manufacturing process that provides a sustainable cost advantage over competitors like Domino's, Pizza Hut, or Little Caesars.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "As a franchisor, the Company is able to leverage the advantages of direct vendor negotiations and volume purchasing of food, equipment, and supplies for the franchisees' and licensees' benefit..." (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
*   The company faces intense competition with respect to price, from many well-established competitors with substantially greater financial and other resources. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Rave's primary intangible assets are its "Pizza Inn" and "Pie Five" trademarks. Pizza Inn has a long history, dating back to 1958, which may provide some brand recognition, particularly in the southern U.S. However, the brands lack the national dominance and pricing power of larger competitors, and the Pie Five brand has been contracting.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company owns various trademarks, including "Pizza Inn" and "Pie Five," which are registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
*   As of June 30, 2024, domestic Pizza Inn restaurants were predominantly in the southern U.S., with Texas, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Mississippi accounting for approximately 63% of domestic units. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
*   Pie Five units are expected to "decrease modestly in future periods." (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Rave's distribution network is managed through third-party distributors, a common industry practice that does not confer a competitive advantage. The company's scale is limited, with only 129 total Pizza Inn units and 20 Pie Five units as of June 2024. This small footprint does not create barriers to entry or allow for significant logistical efficiencies over its much larger rivals.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company facilitates food, equipment, and supply distribution through agreements with third-party distributors. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
*   As of June 30, 2024, the company had a total of 129 Pizza Inn units (105 domestic, 24 international) and 20 domestic Pie Five units. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The company has not disclosed any unique, hard-to-replicate datasets that provide a competitive advantage. While they likely collect sales data, there is no evidence of a sophisticated data feedback loop that materially improves the product or increases retention in a way that competitors cannot replicate.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   There is no mention of a data-driven competitive advantage in the SEC filings reviewed. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 30, 2025, filed May 8, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Rave Restaurant Group's business model is not based on an ecosystem or platform. They do not have a marketplace for complementary products or significant third-party developer adoption. The business is a straightforward restaurant franchising operation.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The business model is centered on franchising and licensing restaurant units, with revenue derived from royalties, fees, and supplier incentives. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The company is subject to standard franchise regulations and local health and safety laws, which apply to all competitors and do not constitute a barrier to entry. There are no exclusive licenses or other regulatory barriers that protect Rave from competition.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company is subject to Federal Trade Commission regulations and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises, as well as local licensing for health, safety, and sanitation. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The restaurant industry requires capital for build-outs and equipment. However, Rave's franchise model outsources most of this capital expenditure to its franchisees. The assets themselves (kitchen equipment, storefronts) are not highly specific and could be repurposed, thus not creating a significant deterrent for new entrants in the broader fast-casual or pizza market.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's business is to franchise and license restaurants, minimizing direct capital expenditures on restaurant assets. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
*   The company's property and equipment, net, was only USD 0.182 million as of June 30, 2024. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Rave's revenue is primarily based on franchise royalties, which are a percentage of franchisee sales. This provides some visibility but is directly tied to the highly competitive and fluctuating consumer restaurant market. There are no long-term, fixed-revenue customer contracts.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Franchise royalties, based on a percentage of franchise restaurant sales, are recognized as sales occur. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **Aggregation**
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.24 + 0.10 + 0 + 0 + 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.02 = 0.8
**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 8.0 / 100

### **Mapping**
The weighted score of 8.0 falls below the threshold of 10 for a moat rating of 1.
*   Weighted < 10 → moat rating = 0

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The company has no discernible competitive advantage, or moat. Its brands have regional recognition but lack pricing power, and the business model has no structural protections against the intense competition in the restaurant industry. Therefore, the estimated moat duration is effectively zero years, as there is no advantage to defend.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Continued Franchisee Attrition:** The net decline in both Pizza Inn and Pie Five units indicates dissatisfaction or unprofitability among franchisees, which could accelerate, further weakening the brand and royalty stream. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
2.  **Intensified Price Competition:** Larger competitors with superior scale and resources could initiate price wars or promotions that RAVE's smaller franchisee base cannot profitably match, leading to further sales declines. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, filed September 26, 2024)
3.  **Shifting Consumer Preferences:** A continued consumer shift away from buffet-style dining or towards newer fast-casual concepts could render the Pizza Inn Buffet model, which is the core of the business, obsolete.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
1.  **Domestic and International Unit Counts:** An accelerating decline signals a weakening system.
2.  **Comparable Store Retail Sales:** Negative trends indicate a loss of brand relevance and pricing power.
3.  **Franchise Royalty Revenue:** A direct measure of the health of the franchisee base.
4.  **Franchise Expenses as a % of Revenue:** Increasing costs to support a shrinking base would be a negative indicator.
5.  **General and Administrative Expenses:** Monitor for cost control relative to the company's shrinking size.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Rave Restaurant Group exhibits no sustainable competitive advantage. The business operates in the highly competitive pizza restaurant industry and lacks any discernible moat based on network effects, switching costs, cost advantages, or intangible assets. Its brands, while possessing some history, do not command pricing power or significant market share. The ongoing decline in the number of franchised units for both its core Pizza Inn brand and the struggling Pie Five concept underscores the absence of any durable competitive edge. A significant, sustained reversal in unit growth and comparable store sales would be required to reconsider this assessment.
