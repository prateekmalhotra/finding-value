Company: PVH Corp., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2025; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 4, 2025; and recent earnings call transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH's core brands, *TOMMY HILFIGER* and *Calvin Klein*, are global lifestyle brands that together generated over 90% of the company's $8.7 billion in revenue in fiscal 2024. The company's "PVH+ Plan" is a multi-year strategy focused on growing these brands, winning with product and consumer engagement, expanding in the digital marketplace, and developing a demand-driven operating model. A key element of this plan involves bringing previously licensed product categories in-house as agreements with third parties like G-III Apparel Group expire through 2027, which is expected to directly boost revenue. While the consumer environment in North America remains challenging, the company's international businesses, particularly in Europe, continue to show growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment is centered on the PVH+ Plan, which explicitly targets winning "with the best product" and developing a "demand- and data-driven operating model." A key strategic initiative is taking back direct control of licensed categories, particularly women's apparel from G-III in North America, to fully realize brand potential. The company is also investing significantly in its supply chain and digital platforms to improve speed-to-market and respond more efficiently to consumer demand. For instance, the company is expanding its use of 3D design to shorten lead times and enhance operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025)]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an apparel company, PVH does not report traditional R&D expenses. Instead, its innovation is embedded in design, merchandising, and marketing functions. The company's in-house design and merchandising teams are described as "significant contributors to the continued strength of our brands," responsible for conceptualizing and implementing design direction. PVH is also investing in technology to improve its processes, such as leveraging data and analytics for merchandising and utilizing 3D design to reduce time-to-market. However, without specific metrics on the output or financial return of these design and process innovations, it is difficult to assess their effectiveness relative to the company's size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH operates a multi-channel global distribution network, selling through wholesale partners (department stores, specialty stores, digital retailers), its own retail stores (full-price and outlet), and direct-to-consumer digital commerce sites. In fiscal 2024, wholesale accounted for approximately 57% of revenue, while the direct-to-consumer channel (retail stores and digital commerce) made up the rest, illustrating a balanced channel mix. The company is strategically focused on growing its direct-to-consumer channels and key wholesale partnerships as part of the PVH+ Plan. However, recent performance has been mixed, with wholesale revenue increasing in the Americas but direct-to-consumer declining in the same region in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH's gross profit margin was 59.4% in fiscal 2024, an improvement from 58.2% in 2023 and 56.8% in 2022. However, income before interest and taxes (EBIT) as a percentage of revenue was 8.9% in fiscal 2024, down from 10.1% in 2023. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, gross margin declined to 58.6% from 61.4% in the prior-year period, attributed to an unfavorable channel mix shift and increased promotional activity. The full-year 2025 gross margin is also expected to decrease by approximately 250 basis points compared to 2024.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key pillar of the PVH+ Plan is to "Drive efficiencies and invest in growth while improving our cost competitiveness." The company has embarked on a multi-year initiative to simplify its operating model, which is expected to generate annual cost savings of $200 million to $300 million by 2026. Specific actions include delivering a single global technology stack, redesigning the global distribution network, and streamlining support functions. The company has also been implementing price increases since 2022 to mitigate higher product and freight costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of February 2, 2025, PVH employed approximately 28,000 associates globally. The company states it strives to create a strong associate experience with opportunities for growth, competitive compensation, and health and wellness programs. It offers programs like a global employee assistance program, paid parental leave, and flexible working arrangements. The company notes that approximately 1% of its total associate population in the United States is represented by unions, and it believes its relations with associates are good. PVH also has works councils in several European countries.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team has seen some changes recently. In December 2024, a new CEO for PVH EMEA, Fredrik Olsson, was appointed. Lea Rytz Goldman joined as Global Brand President for Tommy Hilfiger in April 2024, and Eva Serrano joined as Global Brand President for Calvin Klein in 2023. This indicates a relatively new leadership team for the company's main brands. Stefan Larsson has been CEO since the beginning of 2021. While there is no evidence of poor executive relations, the recent appointments suggest a period of transition rather than long-term stability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH has recently reorganized its leadership structure to be region-focused, with new CEOs for the Americas (Donald Kohler) and EMEA (Fredrik Olsson) appointed in late 2024. The company's two main global brands, *Tommy Hilfiger* and *Calvin Klein*, also have their own Global Brand Presidents (Lea Rytz Goldman and Eva Serrano, respectively), both of whom joined in the last two years. The company's annual report also lists an Executive Vice President & CFO (Zachary Coughlin), a Global Head of Operations and Chief Supply Chain Officer (David Savman), and a Chief People Officer (Amba Subrahmanyam), indicating a full C-suite. While the team is relatively new, the structure appears to provide management depth across both regions and brands.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 2, 2025, PVH's management identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective information technology general controls (ITGCs) in the area of user access management in its EMEA region. As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of that date. The company is in the process of implementing remediation measures. The independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, also issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the apparel industry, brand strength and global recognition are paramount. PVH's ownership of two globally iconic brands, *TOMMY HILFIGER* and *Calvin Klein*, which together generate approximately $18 billion in global retail sales, is a significant competitive advantage. The company’s multi-channel distribution strategy across wholesale, retail, and digital channels in over 40 countries allows it to reach a broad range of consumers. Furthermore, the company's active management of its brand image through high-profile marketing campaigns, celebrity endorsements, and digital engagement is crucial in the fashion industry to maintain cultural relevance and consumer loyalty.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The PVH+ Plan is a multi-year strategic plan aimed at long-term, profitable growth by strengthening its core brands. The company is making significant investments in technology, supply chain, and its direct-to-consumer business, which may impact short-term profitability but are intended to build a more durable business model. The initiative to bring licensed businesses in-house is another example of a long-term strategic move that involves near-term complexity and cost for the benefit of greater control and profitability in the future. Management's commentary in earnings calls often centers on executing this long-term plan.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PVH/transcripts/' (June 5, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of May 4, 2025, PVH had $191 million in cash and cash equivalents and approximately $2.0 billion in available borrowing capacity. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through a share repurchase program. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025 alone, the company repurchased $572 million of its common stock, including through accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements. The company's Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate $5.0 billion stock repurchase program through July 2028. This strong commitment to buybacks, funded by cash on hand and debt, indicates that the company is not likely to resort to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its SEC filings, PVH openly discusses challenges. The company details the negative impacts of inflationary pressures, a challenging consumer environment in North America, and specific issues like the timing of the Lunar New Year affecting APAC sales. The company also disclosed and explained the material weakness in its internal controls over financial reporting. Furthermore, PVH has been transparent about an investigation by China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) and its potential risks, even though the ultimate impact is still uncertain. This level of disclosure in official filings suggests a commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In September 2024, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) initiated an investigation into PVH's business practices, and in February 2025, it placed PVH Corp. on its "List of Unreliable Entities." The investigation was based on suspicions that the company violated normal market trading principles, including suspending transactions with Chinese entities and adopting discriminatory measures related to products from the Xinjiang region. While PVH has provided responses and no specific measures have been imposed yet, being placed on this list by a major foreign government raises significant questions and reputational risk. This development prevents an assessment of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm' (February 2, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm' (May 4, 2025)]

---
**Synthesis**
PVH Corp.'s primary strengths lie in its ownership of the globally recognized *Calvin Klein* and *TOMMY HILFIGER* brands, a clear long-term strategic plan (the PVH+ Plan), and a strong balance sheet that supports substantial shareholder returns without equity dilution. However, the company faces significant challenges that temper this positive outlook. The most pressing issues are the recent deterioration in profit margins, a material weakness in internal accounting controls in its European division, and, most critically, being placed on China's "List of Unreliable Entities," which creates substantial uncertainty and reputational risk. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on three factors: the outcome of the MOFCOM situation in China, the company's ability to remediate its material weakness in internal controls, and the success of its margin improvement and cost-saving initiatives in a challenging retail environment. A resolution of the China investigation without material impact and a successful audit of internal controls would flip both "No" answers to "Yes," significantly improving the company's score.
