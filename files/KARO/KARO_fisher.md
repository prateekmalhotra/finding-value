Company: Karooooo Ltd. (KARO)
Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript snippets, Form 20-F and 6-K SEC filing announcements.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Karooooo operates a SaaS platform for connected vehicles, a market with strong secular tailwinds driven by the need for digital transformation and operational efficiency. The company serves over 125,000 commercial customers with 2.4 million active subscribers across more than 20 countries, indicating a large and underpenetrated Total Addressable Market (TAM). In its Q4 2025 results announcement, Karooooo highlighted accelerating Cartrack subscriber revenue growth, and the Q1 2026 results continued to show strong growth. This suggests a long runway for growth.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Karooooo's SaaS platform for connected vehicles benefits from the network effects of processing over 200 billion data points monthly. This vast dataset allows for the development of differentiated insights and analytics, creating a competitive advantage. The company's vertical integration, with its own hardware and software, could also be a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Karooooo announced the pricing of a secondary public offering of ordinary shares on June 12, 2025. While this was a secondary offering, which does not necessarily dilute existing shareholders, it does indicate a recent return to the equity markets. Without access to the company's balance sheet and cash flow statement, it is difficult to assess the need for future equity financing.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGs9E4L31GkFJr_IFIPoayjxCcVnRTLUzIUuwb8f1H3Ol-AoyCuCeWB2J20JEsW5BsuwmNT72yacxxP36n2vgHwCsbv-IFLr_P3eXpbcFFVcg== (June 12, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed presentations, including video demonstrations of its platform. This suggests a commitment to transparency. However, without an instance of the company navigating a period of trouble, it is difficult to fully assess their candor in all situations.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

Synthesis:
Karooooo scores well on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, commitment to development, and the alignment of its executive team with shareholder interests. The company's large and growing subscriber base, global presence, and the vast amount of data it processes all point to a strong competitive position in the growing telematics industry. However, the analysis is hampered by a lack of detailed financial data and other specific metrics. The score could be significantly impacted in the next 12-24 months by the release of more detailed financial reports that would allow for a thorough analysis of profit margins, R&D effectiveness, and the company's financial strength. A "No" on profit margins could be flipped to a "Yes" with the publication of their next 20-F, if it shows margins that are favorable compared to their peers. Similarly, more disclosure on R&D spending and innovation metrics could change the score for that point.

fisher score is 8 / 15
