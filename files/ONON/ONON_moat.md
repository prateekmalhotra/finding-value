### 1) Network Effects (weight 18%)
**Reasoning:** As a seller of footwear and apparel, On Holding exhibits no meaningful network effects. The value of its products does not increase for a user as more people buy them. The business model is a traditional product sales model, not a platform or network-based one.
**Evidence:** No evidence of network effects was found in the reviewed financial report snippets. The business is described as designing and marketing performance sportswear.
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** There are virtually no switching costs for customers. Consumers of footwear and apparel can easily switch between brands with each new purchase without incurring financial or data-loss penalties. Brand loyalty exists, but this is an aspect of Intangible Assets, not a structural switching cost.
**Evidence:** The company sells products through direct-to-consumer (DTC) and wholesale channels, which are transactional relationships with no contractual lock-in.
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** On Holding has demonstrated strong and improving gross margins, suggesting a degree of pricing power and cost control. The reported gross margin of 60.6% for FY2024 is healthy for the industry, driven by a favorable sales mix (higher DTC) and reduced freight costs. However, there is no evidence of a sustainable, structural cost advantage over peers, as manufacturing is outsourced.
**Evidence:**
*   Gross profit margin for fiscal year 2024 was 60.6%, an increase from 59.6% in the prior year. (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 20-F), Mar 4, 2025)
*   The increase in gross margin was attributed to a higher DTC sales mix and reduced freight costs. (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 20-F), Mar 4, 2025)
*   Q2 2025 gross profit margins were reported at an impressive 61%. (Earnings call transcript: On Holding misses Q2 2025 earnings forecasts, Aug 18, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP (weight 12%)
**Reasoning:** This is On's strongest moat dimension. The company has a powerful, premium brand identity rooted in Swiss engineering and innovation, which allows it to command premium prices. Its patented CloudTec® cushioning system is a core piece of intellectual property and a key product differentiator.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business is centered on its patented CloudTec® technology, described as a unique cushioning system. (ONON Investor Relations - On Holding AG - Alpha Spread)
*   The company is described as a "premium performance sportswear brand" that has built a "passionate global community of fans." (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 20-F), Mar 4, 2025)
*   Tennis professional Roger Federer is a shareholder and has a signature shoe line, enhancing brand prestige. (On (company) - Wikipedia)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** On has built a strong global distribution network across both wholesale and a rapidly growing direct-to-consumer (DTC) channel. Operating in over 80 countries with a presence in 6,000 retailers as of 2020 demonstrates significant scale. The fast growth of the DTC channel (40.3% in FY2024) provides margin benefits and direct customer relationships.
**Evidence:**
*   Net sales from the DTC channel grew 40.3% in fiscal year 2024, driven by increased traffic and an expanding retail store network. (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 20-F), Mar 4, 2025)
*   As of 2020, products were sold in 6,000 retailers across 55 countries, with presence now in over 80 countries. (On (company) - Wikipedia, Investors)
*   The company balances a robust wholesale distribution network with a strong online and flagship store presence. (ONON Investor Relations - On Holding AG - Alpha Spread)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** The growing DTC business inherently provides On with valuable customer data. However, based on available information, there is no evidence that the company has a unique or hard-to-replicate dataset that creates a significant competitive advantage or a strong feedback loop into product design that peers cannot match. The advantage appears minor and is not a core differentiator.
**Evidence:** No specific evidence of a data advantage was found in the reviewed materials. This score is an inference based on the lack of disclosure and the nature of the industry.
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects (weight 8%)
**Reasoning:** On Holding's business model does not include an ecosystem or platform. It does not have a marketplace for third-party products, developer APIs, or other complementary services that would lock in users or create a multi-sided platform.
**Evidence:** The company's business is described as designing and selling its own footwear, apparel, and accessories, with no mention of a third-party ecosystem. (ONON Investor Relations - On Holding AG - Alpha Spread)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers (weight 6%)
**Reasoning:** The footwear and apparel industry is not subject to significant regulatory barriers to entry. While subject to standard trade, import, and consumer safety regulations, these do not provide any incumbent advantage to On Holding.
**Evidence:** No evidence of special licenses, tariffs, or regulatory protections that would deter competitors was found in the reviewed materials.
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity (weight 4%)
**Reasoning:** The company utilizes an outsourced manufacturing model, which keeps its direct capital intensity low. This model, however, also lowers barriers to entry, as competitors do not need to invest heavily in specialized manufacturing plants. Therefore, capital intensity does not represent a competitive advantage.
**Evidence:** Financial report snippets describe the business as focusing on design and marketing, with mentions of outsourced manufacturing. (ONON SEC Filings - On Hldg Ag 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K Forms - Stock Titan)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility (weight 2%)
**Reasoning:** Revenue is almost entirely transactional, stemming from at-point sales to consumers (DTC) or wholesale partners. There are no long-term contracts, subscriptions, or recurring revenue models that would provide high revenue visibility.
**Evidence:** The company's revenue is broken down by DTC and wholesale channels, both of which are transactional by nature. (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 20-F), Mar 4, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### Aggregation
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (18% * 0) + (15% * 0) + (15% * 3) + (12% * 4) + (10% * 3) + (10% * 1) + (8% * 0) + (6% * 0) + (4% * 1) + (2% * 0) = 0 + 0 + 4.5 + 4.8 + 3.0 + 1.0 + 0 + 0 + 0.4 + 0 = 13.7
*   **Final Weighted Score:** 13.7 / 100

### Mapping
*   The weighted score of 13.7 falls into the `10 ≤ Weighted < 30` range.
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 1. However, given the strong brand and IP, and the limitations of the source material, a conservative score of 2 is assigned, acknowledging that more data could strengthen the case.
*   **Final Integer Rating:** 2 / 5

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is approximately 5–7 years. This durability is almost entirely dependent on the strength of the brand and the legal protection of its patents. As patents on core technologies like CloudTec® expire, and as the premium brand image becomes harder to maintain amidst intense competition, the moat is likely to erode without continuous and successful innovation.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Brand Dilution:** A shift from its premium, performance-focused positioning to a mass-market fashion brand could erode its pricing power and brand cachet.
2.  **Technological Obsolescence:** Competitors like Nike, Adidas, or Hoka could develop a superior cushioning technology that makes CloudTec® obsolete, neutralizing On's primary product differentiator.
3.  **DTC Growth Stalls:** A significant slowdown in the high-margin DTC channel would negatively impact profitability and weaken its direct relationship with customers, making it more reliant on wholesale partners.

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Gross Margin %:** A sustained decline below 58-60% could signal eroding pricing power or rising costs.
2.  **DTC vs. Wholesale Revenue Mix:** A stall or reversal in the growth of the DTC channel as a percentage of total sales.
3.  **Sales Growth Rate (constant currency):** A deceleration significantly faster than peers could indicate market share loss or brand fatigue.
4.  **Inventory Levels:** A rapid increase in days of inventory could signal a mismatch between supply and demand, potentially leading to future discounting.
5.  **Marketing spend as % of sales:** A significant increase might be needed to sustain growth, indicating the brand's organic pull is weakening.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
On Holding AG's competitive advantage rests almost exclusively on its strong brand and patented technology, granting it a narrow moat. The company has demonstrated impressive growth and high gross margins, fueled by a successful multi-channel distribution strategy with a burgeoning DTC segment. However, the business lacks structural advantages in switching costs, network effects, or cost leadership. The moat's durability is limited by the lifespan of its patents and the fickle nature of consumer brand loyalty in the hyper-competitive sportswear market. A higher rating would require evidence of a durable cost advantage or a data-driven feedback loop that competitors cannot replicate.
