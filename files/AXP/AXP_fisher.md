Synthesis: American Express scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong brand, loyal customer base, and consistent financial performance. The company's "closed-loop" network and focus on the premium consumer segment provide a significant competitive advantage. The primary area for potential score improvement would be greater transparency in R&D spending to allow for a more direct comparison with competitors. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months include the success of its efforts to attract younger consumers, the impact of any economic downturn on its high-spending customer base, and the evolving competitive landscape in the digital payments industry. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness if the company were to disclose more specific metrics on its innovation pipeline and return on investment in technology.

fisher score is 14 / 15
