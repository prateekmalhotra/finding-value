Company: Chewy, Inc. (CHWY)
Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Chewy, Inc. FY2024 Form 10-K (filed March 26, 2025), Q1 2025 Earnings Transcript (June 11, 2025).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The U.S. pet market is large and expanding, with projections to reach approximately $250 billion by 2030. E-commerce is a significant growth driver within this market, forecast to grow at a 12.60% CAGR through 2030. Chewy is well-positioned to capitalize on these trends through its expansion into high-growth areas like pet healthcare (Chewy Vet Care clinics), international markets (Canada), and growing its private brand portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy demonstrates a strong commitment to innovation and expansion. The company is actively growing its healthcare offerings, including telehealth services ("Connect with a Vet"), an online pharmacy, and the recent launch of physical veterinary clinics ("Chewy Vet Care"). They are also expanding their sponsored ads business and have recently launched in Canada. This shows a clear strategy to move beyond core retail and into higher-margin services and new geographies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a retailer, Chewy does not report R&D as a distinct expense, making a direct peer comparison difficult. One source reported R&D expenses for the trailing 12 months ending May 4, 2025, as a negligible $8.90 million. While the company is clearly innovating with new services and technologies, the lack of transparent, quantifiable R&D investment and associated output metrics makes it impossible to assess its effectiveness relative to its size.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an e-commerce company, Chewy's "sales organization" is its online platform and marketing. Key metrics indicate its effectiveness: Autoship customer sales accounted for 79.2% of net sales in fiscal 2024, demonstrating strong customer retention and recurring revenue. Net sales per active customer also increased by 4.1% to $578 in the same period, showing an increasing share of wallet. These figures point to a highly effective and sticky sales platform.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal year 2024, Chewy reported a gross margin of 29.2% and an operating margin of 0.9%. This compares to competitor Petco's gross margin of 38.2% and operating margin of 0.86%. While Chewy's gross margin is lower, its operating margin is in line with its direct competitor. The company's margins are improving year-over-year, and they are positive, which is a significant achievement for a relatively young, high-growth e-commerce company.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm'], ['https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/woof/financials'], ['https://companiesmarketcap.com/petco/operating-margin/']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy is actively pursuing several margin-enhancing initiatives. These include "supply chain efficiency gains" from automation and optimized fulfillment, growing its higher-margin private label brands, and expanding into the lucrative pet healthcare space. The company is also scaling its sponsored ads business, which is a high-margin revenue stream. Management has reaffirmed its long-term adjusted EBITDA margin goal of 10%.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K describes a focus on employee well-being, with competitive compensation, benefits, and employee resource groups. As of March 19, 2025, no employees were represented by a labor union. While there have been some legal challenges, including a now-overturned OSHA citation and a class-action lawsuit regarding pay, these do not appear to indicate systemic issues within a workforce of approximately 18,000.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm'], ['https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/ca11/22-11626/22-11626-2023-05-30.html'], ['https://news.law/class-action-lawsuit-alleges-that-chewy-fails-to-pay-workers-adequately/']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's senior leadership team shows stability in key positions. The CEO, Sumit Singh, has been in his role since March 2018, and the CTO, Satish Mehta, since June 2018. The recent appointment of a new CFO in February 2024 is not indicative of instability. There is no public evidence of significant executive turnover or internal discord.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the CEO, CFO, and CTO listed in the 10-K, Chewy's senior leadership team includes a Chief Brand Officer, Chief Operations Officer, Chief Accounting Officer, President of Retail, and Chief Customer Care Officer. This demonstrates a well-rounded and deep management team with expertise across key functional areas.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.chewy.com/about/our-team/']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's FY2024 10-K includes an unqualified audit opinion from Deloitte & Touche LLP, indicating that the financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. The report on internal control over financial reporting also concludes that the company's controls were effective. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In e-commerce, customer loyalty and fulfillment are key differentiators. Chewy's Autoship program, which accounts for 79.2% of sales, creates a strong recurring revenue stream and high customer stickiness. The company's extensive fulfillment network, capable of serving over 80% of the U.S. population with overnight shipping, is a significant competitive advantage in a market that values speed and convenience.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary and strategic investments point to a long-range focus. The company's 10-K states its intention to "continue to invest in new growth areas" and "in technology and product innovation...to drive growth and profitability." Investments in new veterinary clinics and international expansion are significant, multi-year projects that are unlikely to be profitable in the short term but are aimed at building a larger, more defensible business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's financial position is strong. The company generated $452.5 million in free cash flow in fiscal 2024 and has access to an $800 million undrawn revolving credit facility. Rather than issuing equity, the company has an active share repurchase program, indicating it has sufficient capital to fund its growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chewy's investor relations materials, including its 10-K, provide a detailed overview of the business, including a comprehensive "Risk Factors" section. There is no public evidence to suggest that management is not candid with investors. The company provides regular financial updates and holds quarterly earnings calls. No evidence of major accounting issues or restatements was found.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm'], ['https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650224000047/chwy-20240728.htm']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While there are no indications of widespread integrity issues, there was a settled SEC case against a former executive for insider trading that occurred in 2021. This was an isolated incident involving a past employee. The company has a formal insider trading policy in place. There are no other significant red flags concerning the integrity of the current senior management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/chewy-executive-conducted-insider-trading-over-pet-insurance-partnership-sec-says-2024-09-27/'], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1766502/000176650225000014/chwy-20250202.htm']

---
**Synthesis:**
Chewy scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strong market potential, a clear commitment to growth, and an effective, sticky business model. The company's strengths lie in its dominant e-commerce platform, high customer loyalty driven by its Autoship program, and strategic expansion into the high-margin pet healthcare sector. The balance sheet is strong, with positive free cash flow and no reliance on dilutive equity financing. The primary "No" on the scorecard relates to the lack of transparent R&D spending, which is not uncommon for a retailer but makes it difficult to assess the efficiency of its innovation efforts. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success and profitability of the new Chewy Vet Care clinics and the continued expansion of higher-margin revenue streams like private label brands and sponsored ads. A "No" would flip to a "Yes" if Chewy began to disclose more specific metrics on its technology and innovation investments.
