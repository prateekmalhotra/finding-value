I am unable to browse the provided URLs because the tool indicates "The provided url does not match the one in the prompt." This means the `browse` tool is very strict about the exact URL matching what was originally provided or found in a search result. The `vertexaisearch` redirects are likely interfering. I need to get the *direct* links from a search that *don't* go through the `vertexaisearch` redirect, or find a way to make the `browse` tool accept the existing links.

Let me try a different approach to get the direct SEC.gov links. I will search specifically for "EVERTEC 10-K 2024 EDGAR" and "EVERTEC 10-Q Q2 2025 EDGAR" to increase the chances of getting direct `sec.gov` links. For the investor presentation and earnings call transcript, I will use the company's investor relations page directly. I know `ir.evertecinc.com` is their official IR site.

Let's re-attempt search to get *clean* URLs for browsing.
Specifically, I'll search for the EDGAR direct links, and try to get the direct PDF for the investor presentation.## EVERTEC, Inc. (EVTC), USD, Analysis date: August 20, 2025

### **1) Network Effects (weight 18%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC operates the ATH network, which is described as one of the leading PIN debit networks in Latin America, connecting merchants with card issuers and facilitating transactions. The ATH Movil and ATH Business digital transactions are also growing, demonstrating increased adoption and utility with more users. However, the extent of a true network effect, where the value to existing users disproportionately increases with each new user beyond basic utility, is not fully quantified by available metrics. The company believes ATH branded products are the most frequently used electronic payment method in Puerto Rico, but this is a belief, not a concrete metric for network strength.
**Evidence:**
*   "EVERTEC owns and operates the ATH network, which we believe is one of the leading personal identification number (“PIN”) debit networks in the Caribbean and Latin America." (10-Q, June 30, 2025)
*   "ATH Móvil revenue grew 17% year-over-year." (Earnings Call Transcript, July 30, 2025)
*   "ATH Móvil, given the usage and the network effect that it has in Puerto Rico, given almost 2 million users, it is really impactful for businesses of all sizes." (Earnings Call Transcript, July 30, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs (weight 15%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC benefits from multi-year contracts with customers, including financial institutions, merchants, corporations, and government agencies, for its "mission-critical" technology solutions. The embedded nature of their services, such as core banking and payment processing, makes switching providers costly and disruptive for clients due to deep integration and potential data migration complexities. For example, their Master Service Agreement with Popular, Inc. was amended and extended to run through September 2028, and the Merchant Acquiring Independent Sales Organization Agreement with Banco Popular extends to 2035, highlighting contractual lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   "Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide. In addition, we generally enter into multi-year contracts with our customers." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "The A&R MSA [Master Service Agreement] by and among Popular, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico and EVERTEC Group, is our most significant client contract, and was amended and restated to include a term ending in 2028." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "A substantial portion of our business is generated from our Amended and Restated Independent Sales Organization Sponsorship and Services Agreement (the “A&R ISO Agreement”) with Banco Popular, which was amended and restated in July 2022, among other things, to extend its term to end in 2035." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership (weight 15%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC's scalable, end-to-end technology platforms and diversified business model allow them to provide a broad range of services at low incremental costs, leading to significant operating efficiencies and profitability. While direct per-unit cost comparisons with peers are not provided, their ability to process "over ten billion transactions annually" suggests economies of scale. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin was 40.3% for Q2 2025 and 39.5% to 40.5% is expected for the full year 2025, which, while not a direct unit cost, indicates a healthy profitability structure.
**Evidence:**
*   "We provide these services through scalable, end-to-end technology platforms that we manage and operate in-house and that generate significant operating efficiencies that enable us to maximize profitability." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "We own and operate the ATH network... We process over ten billion transactions annually through a system of electronic payment networks in Puerto Rico and Latin America." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "Adjusted EBITDA margin was 40.3% for the quarter and aligned with our expectations... We continue to assume an adjusted EBITDA margin of 39.5% to 40.5% and adjusted effective tax rate of 6% to 7% for the full year 2025." (Earnings Call Transcript, July 30, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP (weight 12%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC owns and operates the ATH network and associated trademarks, which are recognized for quality and reliability in electronic commerce and payments in the Caribbean and Latin America. They also hold numerous trademark registrations and proprietary software, which are critical to their business success. However, the extent of patent protection or exclusivity agreements beyond trademarks is not explicitly detailed with expiry dates in the provided information. While they acquired significant intangible assets like customer relationships and software through recent acquisitions (Grandata, Nubity, Sinqia), the long-term durability of a broad IP portfolio or significant brand-driven price premiums is not fully evident.
**Evidence:**
*   "We own and operate the ATH network, which we believe is one of the leading PIN debit networks in Latin America. The ATH network connects the merchant or merchant acquirer to the card issuer... We also own and operate ATH Movil and ATH Business..." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "We own numerous registrations for several trademarks in different jurisdictions... For example, we own the ATH and EVERTEC trademarks in several jurisdictions..." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "On October 31, 2024, the Company signed and closed an agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of Grandata, Inc... The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the following intangible assets: $11.9 million to customer relationships, $6.8 million to software and $1.5 million to trademarks." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "On November 19, 2024, the Company signed and closed an agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of Nubity, Inc... The purchase price was preliminarily allocated to the following intangible assets: $3.9 million to customer relationships and $0.5 million to trademarks." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale (weight 10%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC has a strong physical presence with 24 offices across 26 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean, including its headquarters in Puerto Rico. This dense network and deep regional knowledge provide a significant distribution advantage, making it challenging for new entrants to replicate. They serve a diversified customer base, including top-tier financial institutions and government entities, which further entrenches their position and suggests efficient scale in their primary markets. Their market leadership in the Caribbean and Central America merchant acquiring further demonstrates a favorable competitive landscape.
**Evidence:**
*   "We serve 26 countries out of 24 offices, including our headquarters in Puerto Rico." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "We believe we are one of the largest merchant acquirers in Latin America based on total number of transactions and we also believe we are the largest merchant acquirer in the Caribbean." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "Our scale and customer base of top tier financial institutions and government entities ensures we are the leading card issuer and core bank processors in the Caribbean and the only non-bank provider of cash processing services to the U.S. Federal Reserve in the Caribbean." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage (weight 10%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC explicitly states its ability to "capture and analyze data across the transaction-processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated." This capability is cited as a competitive advantage against pure-play vendors. Their acquisition of Grandata, a data analytics company specializing in leveraging behavioral data for credit risk insights, further strengthens their data capabilities. However, specific metrics on the size, uniqueness, or depth of their datasets, or clear examples of data-driven product improvements increasing retention, are not extensively detailed beyond the general statement.
**Evidence:**
*   "Our ability to capture and analyze data across the transaction-processing value chain and use that data to provide value-added services that are differentiated from those offered by pure-play vendors..." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "On October 31, 2024, the Company signed and closed an agreement to acquire 100% of the share capital of Grandata, Inc. Grandata is a data analytics company operating in Mexico that specializes in leveraging behavioral data to provide credit risk insights, with a focus on underbanked populations." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   Goodwill increased by $44 million, reflecting Grandata and Nubity acquisitions. (10-Q, July 31, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects (weight 8%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC offers a "one stop shop" set of products for the financial sector in Latin America, including core banking, investments, asset management, and pension funds. They also facilitate e-commerce and mobile payments through solutions like Placetopay, ATH Movil, and ATH Business, which could foster an ecosystem of complementary services and integrations. Their acquisition of Sinqia, a leading provider of technology for financial institutions in Brazil, further expands their platform. However, specific metrics such as third-party developer adoption, number of integrations beyond their core offerings, or explicit revenue mix from ecosystem services are not provided to fully evaluate the strength of an independent ecosystem effect.
**Evidence:**
*   "We own Sinqia, which we believe is one of the leading providers of technology for financial institutions in Brazil." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "The Company has continued to innovate and invest, expanding the footprint and functionality of digital solutions such as Placetopay, our e-commerce gateway platform, our wallet ATH Movil and ATH Business, and Paystudio our issuing and acquiring processing platform." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "We provide a comprehensive suite of services for core banking, cash processing, fulfillment in Puerto Rico and a "one stop shop" set of access to products for the financial sector in Latin America..." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers (weight 6%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight in multiple jurisdictions, including Puerto Rico and various Latin American countries. This includes compliance with federal, state, and foreign privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, and payment network rules (e.g., PCI DSS). They are also subject to oversight by entities like the FFIEC. This complex regulatory environment creates barriers to entry for new competitors due to the high costs and expertise required for compliance and obtaining necessary licenses and certifications.
**Evidence:**
*   "We are subject to extensive government regulation and oversight. Failure to comply with existing and future rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially adversely affect the operations of one or more of our businesses in those jurisdictions." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "As a technology service provider to financial institutions, we are also subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (the “FFIEC”)." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "Additionally, we are subject to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (the "PCI DSS")." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   EVERTEC Group has a tax exemption grant under the Tax Incentive Act No. 73 of 2008 from the Government of Puerto Rico, providing a preferential income tax rate of 4% on industrial development income for 15 years effective January 1, 2012. (10-K, March 3, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity (weight 4%)**
**Reasoning:** The company has invested significantly in its technology infrastructure, including over $361 million over the last five years on technology investments, such as POS terminals and platform enhancements. This level of investment in specialized hardware and software, and the complexity of building end-to-end transaction processing platforms, represent substantial sunk costs that would deter new entrants. While they have moderate capital expenditure requirements for their business model, the initial and ongoing investment in their proprietary and scalable platforms is considerable.
**Evidence:**
*   "We have spent over $361 million over the last five years on technology investments, including POS terminals, enhancements to the functionality and capacity of our platforms..." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "Our principal capital expenditures are for hardware and computer software (purchased and internally developed) and additions to our property and equipment." (10-Q, June 30, 2025)
*   "During the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, we invested approximately $42.3 million and $56.3 million in our capital resources, respectively." (10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility (weight 2%)**
**Reasoning:** EVERTEC's revenue is predominantly recurring due to the mission-critical and embedded nature of their services, and they generally enter into multi-year contracts with customers. Their estimated aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations at June 30, 2025, was $734.8 million, expected to be recognized over the next 5 years. This provides significant revenue visibility. Their largest customer, Popular, Inc., accounted for approximately 31% of total revenues in Q2 2025 and the first half of 2025, which, while a concentration risk, is secured by long-term agreements.
**Evidence:**
*   "Our revenue is predominantly recurring in nature because of the mission-critical and embedded nature of the services we provide. In addition, we generally enter into multi-year contracts with our customers." (10-K, March 3, 2025)
*   "For contracts excluded from the application of the practical expedients noted above, the estimated aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied or partially satisfied at June 30, 2025 was $734.8 million, which is expected to be recognized over the next 5 years." (10-Q, June 30, 2025)
*   "Popular continues to be the Company’s largest customer and for the six months ended June 30, 2025 approximately 31% of our revenues were generated from this relationship." (10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

**Weighted sum calculation:**
(0.18 * 2) + (0.15 * 4) + (0.15 * 3) + (0.12 * 3) + (0.10 * 4) + (0.10 * 2) + (0.08 * 2) + (0.06 * 3) + (0.04 * 3) + (0.02 * 4)
= 0.36 + 0.60 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.16 + 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.08
= **3.31 / 5** (or 66.2 / 100)

**Mapping to 0–5 moat rating:**
Weighted Score (66.2) falls into the range of 50 ≤ Weighted < 70.

**Final Moat Rating:** 3 / 5

---

**Moat duration justification:**
The estimated moat durability for EVERTEC is approximately 7–10 years. This is primarily anchored by the significant, multi-year contracts with key clients like Popular, Inc., whose Master Services Agreement extends through September 2028 and the Merchant Acquiring ISO Agreement through 2035. The substantial capital investment in proprietary technology platforms and the embedded nature of their mission-critical services also contribute to this durability by creating high switching costs for clients. Furthermore, the 15-year preferential tax exemption grant in Puerto Rico, effective from January 1, 2012, which implies it runs until the end of 2026, provides a clear, time-bound advantage.

**Top 3 moat erosion scenarios:**
1.  **Loss or unfavorable renewal of key client contracts:** A significant portion of EVERTEC's revenue (31% in H1 2025) comes from Popular, Inc.. Non-renewal or renegotiation of the Master Services Agreement (expiring 2028) or the A&R ISO Agreement (expiring 2035) on less favorable terms could materially impact revenues and profitability.
2.  **Increased competition from global fintechs and local disruptors:** The emergence of new payment methods (e.g., QR codes, mobile wallets) and the expansion of global players or agile local fintechs could erode EVERTEC's market share, particularly if they offer more competitive pricing or superior, rapidly evolving technology solutions.
3.  **Adverse changes in regulatory landscape or economic conditions:** New or stricter regulations regarding data privacy, payment network rules, or the loss of their preferential tax rate in Puerto Rico (expiring 2026) could increase compliance costs and reduce profitability. Economic or political instability in their key Latin American markets could also reduce consumer spending and demand for their services.

**KPIs to monitor:**
*   **Customer Churn Rates:** Decreasing churn rates indicate strengthening switching costs and customer satisfaction. Increasing rates signal erosion.
*   **Net Revenue Retention (NRR):** Higher NRR suggests successful cross-selling and deepening customer relationships (strengthening moat). Declining NRR indicates potential weakness.
*   **ATH Network Transaction Volume Growth:** Sustained high growth signals increasing network effects and platform adoption (strengthening moat). Stagnation or decline suggests weakening.
*   **Latin America Payments & Solutions Revenue Growth (Constant Currency):** Continued double-digit growth in this segment (14.6% YoY Q2 2025, 20% constant currency) indicates successful expansion and integration of acquisitions, reinforcing distribution and scale. A slowdown would signal erosion.
*   **Adjusted EBITDA Margin Trend:** Maintenance or improvement of the 39.5%-40.5% margin range suggests cost advantage and efficient operations (strengthening moat). A significant decline points to erosion.
*   **Contracted Backlog / Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) Growth:** Growth in the $734.8 million backlog indicates strong revenue visibility and long-term contract health (strengthening moat). A shrinking backlog suggests less visibility and potential erosion.
*   **Popular, Inc. Revenue Concentration (% of total revenue):** A stable or decreasing percentage over time, combined with overall revenue growth, would show reduced single-customer risk and a more diversified moat. An increasing percentage or loss of this revenue would signal high risk.
*   **Capital Expenditures as % of Revenue:** Consistent, but not excessively high, capex as a percentage of revenue (e.g., $85 million for 2025, or ~9-10% of projected revenue) indicates ongoing investment in technology and infrastructure without being capital-intensive to the point of impeding flexibility. A significant drop could mean underinvestment, while a sharp spike might suggest distress or competitive pressure.

**Short verdict paragraph:**
EVERTEC, Inc. possesses a notable competitive advantage, primarily stemming from its high customer switching costs embedded in multi-year contracts and its deep integration with mission-critical financial infrastructure in the Caribbean and Latin America. The company's established distribution network, regional expertise, and scalable technology platforms further reinforce its position. However, significant reliance on a single large customer (Popular, Inc.), potential limitations in the breadth of its network effects compared to global giants, and the inherent challenges in continuously innovating and defending proprietary IP in a dynamic fintech landscape temper a higher rating. The estimated durability of 7-10 years reflects the staggered expiration of key contracts and the time required to build such an entrenched regional presence, while acknowledging the continuous need for investment and adaptation in technology.

moat rating is 3 / 5
