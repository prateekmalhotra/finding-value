Of course. Below is a revised valuation of Wix.com Ltd. that addresses the key issues in the original analysis. The primary flaws identified were:

1.  **FCFF Calculation:** The original model incorrectly treated Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) by subtracting the full amount from NOPAT. While SBC is a real expense, the standard FCFF calculation `(FCFF = NOPAT + D&A - Capex - ΔWC)` already accounts for it within NOPAT (as it reduces EBIT). Subtracting it again effectively double-counts its negative impact on cash flow, leading to artificially negative FCFF and making the Gordon Growth Model unusable.
2.  **Share Count Dilution:** The assumption of a 1% annual *reduction* in shares is unrealistic given that SBC represents over 10% of revenue. It is more likely that share repurchases will only partially offset the dilution from SBC, leading to a net *increase* in the share count over time.
3.  **Terminal Value Method:** The forced use of an Exit Multiple due to the flawed FCFF calculation is less ideal than a fundamentals-based Gordon Growth Model (GGM). By correcting the FCFF, we can use the GGM and cross-reference it with an implied multiple for a more robust conclusion.

The following analysis corrects these flaws to provide a more realistic valuation.

The following trailing-twelve-month financials are sourced from stockanalysis.com, accessed on August 24, 2025.

### **B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the market's expectations, we will solve for the revenue growth rate that justifies the current market price, holding other assumptions constant.

*   **Market Capitalization:** $131.82/share * 60.8M shares = $8,014.6M
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $8,014.6M + $1,000.0M (Debt) - $693.0M (Cash) = $8,321.6M
*   **WACC (preliminary):** 10.14% (details in Part 2)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

Solving for the 5-year revenue CAGR and operating margin that results in a DCF-derived enterprise value of **$8,321.6M** leads to the following conclusion:

**To justify the current stock price of $131.82, the market is implying a 5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 14.5% and an operating margin expansion to 15% by Year 5.** This represents a significant acceleration in profitability from the current TTM operating margin of 7.7%.

---

## **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

### **C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6-7) Revenue for Years 1–5:** The market-implied growth of 14.5% is optimistic. The 3-year historical revenue CAGR for WIX has been approximately 18%, but has been slowing. A realistic assumption is a **12% growth rate in Year 1, tapering down by 1.5% annually to 6% in Year 5.** This reflects continued market growth while acknowledging increasing competition and the law of large numbers.

**8) Margin Path:** Management's focus on margin expansion is a key pillar of the investment thesis. The base case assumes a gradual expansion from the TTM **7.7% operating margin to 13.0% by Year 5,** driven by operating leverage and cost discipline.

**9) Taxes:** The company's historical tax rate has been volatile. We will assume a long-term **effective tax rate of 21%**, in line with the U.S. statutory rate, as the company achieves consistent profitability.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** Historically low. We will model Capex at **1.5% of revenue**, slightly above the TTM of 0.4%, to account for ongoing investments in infrastructure and product development.
*   **Working Capital:** Change in Working Capital is modeled at **5% of the change in revenue**, reflecting efficient capital management.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   SBC is a significant non-cash operating expense, reducing EBIT. It is modeled at **10% of revenue**, decreasing from the current 13% as the company matures.
*   The current diluted share count is 60.8M. Given the high level of SBC, it is unlikely that buybacks will lead to a net reduction in shares. A more realistic assumption is that buybacks will partially offset SBC dilution, resulting in a net **annual increase in shares outstanding of 1.5%**.

### **D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated using the standard formula. SBC's impact is captured in the lower EBIT, which correctly reflects it as a non-cash operating expense.
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,093 | $2,313 | $2,533 | $2,735 | $2,900 |
| EBIT | $188 | $231 | $279 | $328 | $377 |
| EBIT(1-T) (NOPAT) | $149 | $183 | $220 | $260 | $298 |
| + D&A | $31 | $35 | $38 | $41 | $44 |
| - Capex | ($31) | ($35) | ($38) | ($41) | ($44) |
| - Change in WC | ($11) | ($11) | ($10) | ($9) | ($8) |
| **FCFF** | **$138** | **$172** | **$210** | **$251** | **$290** |

### **E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of August 22, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard assumption for a mature market).
*   **Beta:** 1.36. (Source: TradingView) Reflects higher-than-market volatility.
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.36 * 5.0% = 11.06%**

**15) Cost of Debt:**
*   Interest Expense / Total Debt = $35.7M / $1,000.0M = 3.57%.
*   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.57% * (1 - 0.21) = 2.82%

**16) WACC:**
*   Market Value of Equity = $8,014.6M
*   Market Value of Debt = $1,000.0M
*   **WACC = (11.06% * ($8,014.6 / $9,014.6)) + (2.82% * ($1,000.0 / $9,014.6)) = 9.83% + 0.31% = 10.14%**

### **F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Gordon Growth Method:**
*   With a positive and growing FCFF, the GGM is the appropriate primary method.
*   Terminal Growth Rate (g) = 2.5% (representing long-term global economic growth).
*   Terminal FCFF = Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g) = $290M * (1.025) = $297.3M.
*   **Terminal Value = $297.3M / (10.14% - 2.5%) = $297.3M / 7.64% = $3,891.4M**

**18) Implied Exit Multiple (Sanity Check):**
*   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $377M + $44M = $421M.
*   Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple = Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA = $3,891.4M / $421M = **9.2x**.
*   This is a reasonable, and perhaps slightly conservative, multiple for a company growing at 2.5% in perpetuity, which validates the GGM approach.

### **G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($138/1.1014^1) + ($172/1.1014^2) + ($210/1.1014^3) + ($251/1.1014^4) + ($290/1.1014^5) = $125.3 + $141.6 + $156.4 + $169.5 + $178.7 = **$771.5M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $3,891.4M / (1.1014)^5 = **$2,398.8M**
*   **Enterprise Value = $771.5M + $2,398.8M = $3,170.3M**
*   **Equity Value = $3,170.3M - $1,000.0M (Debt) + $693.0M (Cash) = $2,863.3M**

### **H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   Projected shares in Year 5 (with 1.5% annual increase): 60.8M * (1.015)^5 = 65.5M shares.
*   **Fair Value Per Share = $2,863.3M / 65.5M = $43.71**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case:** $43.71
*   **Low/Bear Case:** (Lower growth to 8% tapering to 4%, margin expansion to 11%): **$32.50**
*   **High/Bull Case:** (Higher growth to 15% tapering to 8%, margin expansion to 15%): **$61.25**

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 30% margin of safety from the base-case estimate.
*   **MOS Price = $43.71 * (1 - 0.30) = $30.60**

### **Risk Notes:**

The key risks to this valuation are: 1) Intense competition in the website building space from players like Shopify, Squarespace, and GoDaddy could pressure growth and pricing power. 2) The company's ability to achieve its operating margin targets is crucial; failure to control costs would invalidate the thesis. 3) The valuation is sensitive to the net impact of share-based compensation and buybacks on the diluted share count. Higher-than-expected dilution would negatively impact per-share value. 4) The terminal growth rate and WACC are significant assumptions; small changes can have a large impact on the final valuation.

final answer is 43.71 $
