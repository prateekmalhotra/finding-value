**Synthesis (5–7 sentences):**
Trip.com Group Limited shows strong positives in its growth trajectory, particularly in the international market, and its commitment to technological innovation. The company's solid financial health and transparent investor communications are also key strengths. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of detailed information on R&D effectiveness, labor relations, and management depth. The score could be most impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to sustain its international growth, the effectiveness of its AI investments in improving margins, and any potential changes in the competitive landscape of the online travel industry. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for the currently unanswered points if the company provides more detailed disclosures in its future reports and presentations.
