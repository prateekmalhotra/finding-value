### PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)

This section ascertains the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1) **Current Market Price**: The stock price for BJ is retrieved to establish the target valuation for the reverse DCF.


### **B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

Based on a preliminary analysis, to justify the current market price of **$97.11 per share** (TradingView, August 24, 2025), the market is implying a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 7.5%** and a stable **operating margin of 3.8%** (equal to the TTM margin), assuming a WACC of 7.5% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%.

This implies that investors expect BJ's to grow faster than its recent historical average and maintain its current profitability levels. This growth could be attributed to continued new club openings, growth in membership fee income, and expansion of its digital offerings.

### PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)

This section presents a realistic, independent valuation based on a critical review of historical performance, management guidance, and industry comparables.

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6) **Revenue for Years 1â€“5**: The market-implied 7.5% CAGR is aggressive. The 3-year historical revenue CAGR is approximately 5.0%. Management commentary from recent earnings calls suggests a focus on steady club expansion and digital growth. A more conservative assumption is a **5.5% growth rate in Year 1, tapering down to 3.5% by Year 5**. This reflects continued expansion but at a more moderate pace than the market implies.

7) **Margin Path**: Management has not provided specific long-term margin guidance. The average operating margin for the last three fiscal years has been approximately 3.7%. The TTM operating margin is 3.8%. Therefore, I will use a **stable operating margin of 3.7%** throughout the forecast period, assuming that cost inflation and investments in digital capabilities will offset any potential operating leverage from growth.

8) **Taxes**: The effective tax rate has fluctuated. Over the last three fiscal years, the rate has averaged approximately 26.7%. The most recent fiscal year's rate was 25.9%. I will use a **conservative effective tax rate of 27.0%**. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, p. 72)

9) **Capital Intensity**:
    *   **Capex**: Management has guided for continued investment in new clubs and remodeling existing ones. The 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 2.4%. I will project **capex at 2.5% of total revenue** annually to support the expansion strategy. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025)
    *   **Working Capital**: The change in working capital has been volatile. Based on historical trends, I will model the change in net working capital as **1.0% of the change in total revenue**.

10) **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks**:
    *   **SBC**: Stock-based compensation is a real expense and will be subtracted from FCFF. The 3-year average SBC as a percentage of revenue is approximately 0.2%. I will forecast **SBC at 0.2% of total revenue**. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025)
    *   **Share Count**: BJ's has an active share repurchase program. The diluted share count has decreased from 136.5 million in FY2022 to 133.6 million in FY2024. Considering the current repurchase authorization and historical trends, I will project a **net annual reduction in diluted shares of 1.0%**. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, p. 51)

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12) **Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)** is the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is calculated as:
FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD in millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $21,629 | $22,711 | $23,738 | $24,688 | $25,552 |
| EBIT | $800 | $840 | $878 | $913 | $945 |
| NOPAT | $584 | $613 | $641 | $667 | $690 |
| D&A | $275 | $289 | $302 | $315 | $327 |
| SBC | -$43 | -$45 | -$47 | -$49 | -$51 |
| Capex | -$541 | -$568 | -$593 | -$617 | -$639 |
| Change in WC | -$11 | -$11 | -$10 | -$9 | -$9 |
| **FCFF** | **$264** | **$278** | **$293** | **$307** | **$318** |

13) FCFF is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure, making it suitable for an enterprise-level valuation.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14) **Cost of Equity (CAPM)**:
*   **Risk-Free Rate**: 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium**: 5.0% (standard for a mature market like the U.S.).
*   **Beta**: 0.49 (StockAnalysis.com). This low beta reflects the non-cyclical, consumer staples nature of BJ's business.
*   **Cost of Equity** = 4.25% + 0.49 * 5.0% = **6.70%**

15) **Cost of Debt**: The pre-tax cost of debt in the original analysis was based on historical interest expense, which is not forward-looking. A more accurate method is to use the risk-free rate plus a credit spread based on the company's credit rating. For a stable retailer like BJ's (comparable to a BBB rating), a credit spread of 1.50% is more realistic.
*   Pre-Tax Cost of Debt = Risk-Free Rate + Credit Spread = 4.25% + 1.50% = 5.75%
*   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.75% * (1 - 27.0%) = **4.20%**.

16) **WACC**:
*   Market Value of Equity = 132.1M shares * $97.11 = $12,828M
*   Market Value of Debt = $573.8M
*   **WACC** = (12828 / (12828 + 574)) * 6.70% + (574 / (12828 + 574)) * 4.20% = **6.59%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17) **Gordon Growth Method Cross-Check**: A terminal growth rate of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
*   Terminal Value = (FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($318 * 1.025) / (6.59% - 2.5%) = **$7,969M**

18) **Exit Multiple Method**:
*   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $945M + $327M = $1,272M
*   The Gordon Growth terminal value implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of $7,969M / $1,272M = **6.3x**. This is still too low for a stable, membership-based retailer, as sector peers like Costco and Walmart historically trade at much higher multiples (12x-20x+).
*   The original analysis's 8.0x multiple was a step in the right direction but remained overly conservative. A more realistic exit multiple for a #3 player in a stable oligopoly is **10.0x EV/EBITDA**. This acknowledges BJ's quality without assigning it the premium multiple of the market leader.
*   **Terminal Value** = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $1,272M * 10.0 = **$12,720M**. This is chosen as the primary method for the terminal value calculation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19) **Enterprise Value**:
*   PV of FCFFs = $248 + $245 + $242 + $238 + $232 = $1,205M
*   PV of Terminal Value = $12,720M / (1 + 6.59%)^5 = $9,244M
*   **Enterprise Value** = $1,205M + $9,244M = **$10,449M**

20) **Equity Value**:
*   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $573.8M - $28.3M = $545.5M (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, p. 50)
*   **Equity Value** = $10,449M - $545.5M = **$9,903.5M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21) **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**:
*   Projected Year 5 Diluted Shares = 132.1M * (1 - 0.01)^5 = 125.6M shares
*   **Fair Value per Share** = $9,903.5M / 125.6M = **$78.85**

22) **Valuation Range**:
*   **Base Case**: **$78.85**.
*   **Low/Bear Case**: Assumes 3.0% tapering to 1.5% revenue growth, 3.5% operating margin, and an 8.0x exit multiple. Resulting value: **~$61**.
*   **High/Bull Case**: Assumes 7.0% tapering to 4.5% revenue growth, 4.0% operating margin, and a 11.0x exit multiple. Resulting value: **~$95**.

23) **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**: A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for unforeseen risks.
*   **MOS Price** = $78.85 * (1 - 0.30) = **$55.20**

### Risk Notes

1.  **Competition**: The warehouse club industry is highly competitive, with Costco and Sam's Club being major national players. Price competition could pressure margins.
2.  **Consumer Spending**: As a retailer, BJ's is susceptible to downturns in consumer discretionary spending, which could be impacted by inflation, interest rates, or a recession.
3.  **Membership Renewal**: The business model relies heavily on high membership renewal rates. A failure to provide compelling value could lead to a decline in renewals and negatively impact high-margin membership fee income.
4.  **Gasoline Price Volatility**: Fluctuations in gasoline prices can significantly impact reported revenue and gross margin percentages, potentially masking underlying performance trends in the core merchandise business.
5.  **Supply Chain**: Disruptions in the supply chain, particularly for imported goods, could lead to inventory shortages and increased costs.

final answer is 78.85 $
