**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While specific R&D expenditure figures are not detailed in the provided search results, Disney's continuous innovation in its streaming technology, theme park attractions, and content creation points to a significant investment in research and development. The turnaround in the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) segment, which is now profitable, suggests effective R&D in streaming technology and user experience. The planned $60 billion investment in the Experiences segment will undoubtedly involve substantial R&D in new attraction design and technology. However, without specific R&D spending figures and a direct comparison to competitors, a definitive "Yes" is difficult.
**Answer:** No

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's powerful brand recognition and marketing prowess act as a formidable sales organization.

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney has demonstrated improving profitability, with a 20% rise in adjusted EPS to $1.45 and a 7% revenue increase to $23.6 billion in Q2 2025.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney is actively implementing several strategies to improve profit margins. The company has shifted its focus from subscriber growth at all costs to profitability in its streaming business. This includes pricing increases and the introduction of advertising-supported tiers for its streaming services. A continued commitment to cutting costs is also a key part of the company's strategy to make the business more efficient and effective. In its DTC segment, the integration of Hulu and ESPN+ into the Disney+ app is expected to increase engagement and reduce churn, further supporting margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information in the provided search results to definitively assess the current state of Disney's labor and personnel relations. While the company is a major employer, the search results do not contain details on employee turnover, engagement scores, or recent labor negotiations. Without this information, it is not possible to give a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has recently faced challenges with activist investors, indicating some level of disagreement regarding the company's strategy and board composition.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided search results do not offer enough information to evaluate the depth of Disney's management team beyond the CEO and the board.

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's management has emphasized a "continued commitment to cutting costs" and making the business "more efficient and effective," suggesting a focus on cost analysis. The company's detailed financial reporting, with segment breakdowns, as evidenced by the Q2 2025 results, points to robust accounting controls. The ability to provide specific guidance on adjusted EPS and operating cash flow for 2025 also indicates a high level of confidence in their financial controls and analysis.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's key competitive advantage lies in its vast and beloved intellectual property (IP) portfolio. This IP provides a unique and powerful engine for all of its business segments, from movies and streaming content to theme parks and merchandise. The ability to create and monetize enduring franchises like Marvel, Star Wars, and its classic animated characters gives Disney a significant edge over its competitors. The integration of its various businesses creates a synergistic ecosystem that is difficult to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's strategic shift in its streaming business from subscriber growth at all costs to a focus on profitability demonstrates a long-range profit outlook. The company's significant planned investment of $60 billion in its Experiences segment over the next decade is another clear indication of its commitment to long-term growth. Management's confidence in providing aggressive 2025 guidance, with an 18% increase in adjusted EPS, signals a focus on delivering sustainable, long-term shareholder value.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Disney's strong balance sheet, as mentioned in a shareholder letter, and its commitment to returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases indicate a healthy financial position. The company projects $17 billion in operating cash flow for 2025 and plans $3 billion in share repurchases, which suggests that it is not only self-sufficient in funding its growth but is also actively reducing the number of outstanding shares. The reinstatement of the dividend also signals confidence in the company's financial stability.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has been actively communicating its strategy and progress to shareholders, particularly in the face of challenges from activist investors. Management's willingness to shift its streaming strategy and openly discuss the move from subscriber growth to profitability shows a degree of transparency. The detailed guidance for 2025, including specific targets for EPS and operating cash flow, also suggests a commitment to keeping investors informed.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided search results do not contain any information to suggest a lack of integrity on the part of Disney's management. There are no mentions of legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would call into question the integrity of the management team. However, without specific evidence to the contrary, it is not possible to definitively say "Yes" to this question based on the provided information. The proxy fight with activist investors is a business dispute and not necessarily an indication of a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
The Walt Disney Company scores well on many of Fisher's 15 points, particularly in its long-term growth prospects, commitment to development, and strong financial position. The company's powerful intellectual property and strategic shift to profitability in its streaming business are significant strengths. The primary areas of concern are in the qualitative aspects of the business, such as labor relations, executive relations, and management depth, where more information is needed for a positive assessment. The recent proxy battles with activist investors, while resolved, suggest that there have been some disagreements about the company's direction. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months with a demonstrated period of stable executive leadership, more clarity on management succession, and positive reports on employee relations. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness with more specific data on spending and innovation metrics. Similarly, more insight into the company's culture and employee satisfaction would be needed to change the "No" on labor relations.

fisher score is 10 / 15
