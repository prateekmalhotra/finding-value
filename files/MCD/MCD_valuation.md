Of course. This is a very well-structured valuation analysis. However, there are a few critical flaws and areas where the assumptions can be refined to better reflect reality. The most significant issues are an inconsistency in the revenue forecast and a methodological error in the final per-share value calculation that materially overstates the result.

Here is a revised and corrected version of the valuation, maintaining the same format and level of detail while addressing these issues.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the current stock price to determine the growth and profitability assumptions embedded within it.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$314.00** (Source: Investing.com, August 22, 2025)
2.  **Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months ended June 30, 2025):**

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $26,060 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Gross Margin | 56.99% | Inferred from Gross Profit/Revenue |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $12,022 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Net Income | $8,393 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $2,149 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $173 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | $2,896 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Change in Working Capital | ($465) | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |

| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 719 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions priced into the stock, we first calculate the current Enterprise Value and a WACC.

*   **Market Capitalization:** $314.00/share * 719 million shares = $225,766 million.
*   **Enterprise Value:** $225,766M (Market Cap) + $55,892M (Total Debt) - $1,876M (Cash) = **$279,782 million**.
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Cost of Equity (CAPM): 4.26% (10-Yr Treasury) + 0.52 (5Y Beta) * 5.0% (Equity Risk Premium) = **6.86%**.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt: (1,526M / 55,892M) * (1 - 20.6%) = **2.17%**.
    *   WACC: (80.2% * 6.86%) + (19.8% * 2.17%) = **5.93%**.
*   **Market-Implied Assumptions:**
    Using the current Enterprise Value of $279,782M and a WACC of 5.93%, we can solve for the assumptions that justify this price. Holding the Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) operating margin of 46.1% and other capital ratios constant, the model requires a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 2.6%** followed by a 2.5% terminal growth rate.

> **Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the stock price of $314.00, an investor must believe McDonald's can grow its revenue at approximately **2.6% annually** for the next five years while maintaining its current high level of profitability. This provides a sound benchmark for our own analysis.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a 5-year Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) model based on independent, realistic assumptions derived from historical performance and future expectations.

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The market's implied 2.6% growth rate is a plausible long-term expectation. The original analysis's revenue growth assumption was sound in its logic but inconsistent in its application. This revised model corrects that and makes other key refinements.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:** A modest recovery from the recent TTM slowdown (1.2%) followed by a normalization toward the long-term economic growth rate is a realistic scenario.
    *   **Assumption:** Revenue growth of **4.0% in Year 1, tapering by 0.5% each year to 2.0% in Year 5.** This reflects a near-term boost from pricing and marketing initiatives, gradually maturing to a sustainable long-term rate.

8.  **Margin Path:** TTM operating margin is 46.1%. The 3-year average is 44.8%.
    *   **Assumption:** **Operating Margin remains stable at 45.0%** for the forecast period. This is a prudent assumption that balances recent strength with the long-term average, avoiding overly optimistic margin expansion.

9.  **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is 20.6%.
    *   **Assumption:** An **effective tax rate of 21.0%** is used, aligning with the U.S. statutory corporate rate and providing a normalized long-term expectation.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** The 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue is 8.7%. The TTM figure is higher at 11.1%.
        *   **Assumption:** Capex will run at **9.0% of annual revenue**, reflecting continued investment in store modernization and technology.
    *   **Working Capital:** For a mature, efficient business like McDonald's, major swings are unlikely.
        *   **Assumption:** Change in Non-Cash Working Capital is **0.0% of incremental revenue**, assuming efficient inventory and payables management.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** TTM SBC is 0.66% of revenue.
        *   **Assumption:** SBC remains constant at **0.7% of annual revenue**.
    *   **Share Count:** The company actively buys back shares. While this reduces share count over time, the value of the enterprise belongs to the shareholders *today*. The cash used for buybacks is implicitly part of the FCFF. Therefore, the valuation must be based on the *current* share count.
        *   **Correction:** We will use the **current diluted share count of 719 million** for the final per-share calculation.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital. D&A is assumed to be 8.2% of revenue, in line with historical averages.

13. **FCFF Projection (USD Millions):** (*Corrected for consistent revenue taper*)

| Year | 1 (2026) | 2 (2027) | 3 (2028) | 4 (2029) | 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $27,102 | $28,051 | $28,892 | $29,614 | $30,207 |
| *Growth* | *4.0%* | *3.5%* | *3.0%* | *2.5%* | *2.0%* |
| EBIT (45.0% margin) | $12,196 | $12,623 | $13,001 | $13,327 | $13,593 |
| NOPAT (21% tax) | $9,635 | $9,972 | $10,271 | $10,528 | $10,738 |
| D&A | $2,222 | $2,300 | $2,369 | $2,428 | $2,477 |
| Capex | ($2,439) | ($2,525) | ($2,600) | ($2,665) | ($2,719) |
| SBC | ($190) | ($196) | ($202) | ($207) | ($211) |
| Change in WC | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$9,228** | **$9,551** | **$9,838** | **$10,084** | **$10,285** |

> I am using FCFF for this valuation as it represents the total cash flow available to all capital providers and provides a valuation independent of capital structure changes.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** **6.86%**
15. **Cost of Debt:** **2.17%** (After-tax)
16. **WACC Calculation:** `WACC = (80.2% * 6.86%) + (19.8% * 2.17%) = 5.93%`

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Refined Approach (Exit Multiple Method):** For a mature, stable company like McDonald's, applying a market-based exit multiple is often more realistic than assuming a perpetual growth rate. It grounds the terminal value in the current and historical valuation context for similar blue-chip companies.
    *   **Assumption:** An **Exit EV/EBITDA Multiple of 18.5x** is used. This is slightly below the current TTM multiple of 19.6x ($279,782 EV / $14,171 TTM EBITDA), reflecting a slight normalization from current levels but still representing a premium valuation for a high-quality, wide-moat business.
    *   Projected EBITDA in Year 5 = Year 5 EBIT ($13,593M) + Year 5 D&A ($2,477M) = **$16,070 million**
    *   `Terminal Value = Projected Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple`
    *   `Terminal Value = $16,070 * 18.5`
    *   **Terminal Value = $297,295 million**

18. **Cross-Check (Implied Gordon Growth Rate):**
    a. We can calculate the perpetual growth rate (`g`) implied by this terminal value:
    b. `g = (WACC * TV - FCFF_Year5) / (TV + FCFF_Year5)`
    c. `g = (0.0593 * 297,295 - 10,285) / (297,295 + 10,285)`
    d. `g = (17,629 - 10,285) / 307,580 = 7,344 / 307,580 = 2.39%`
    e. This implied growth rate of **2.4%** is very reasonable and aligns perfectly with long-term inflation and global GDP growth expectations, confirming our Exit Multiple assumption is sound.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: ($9,228/1.0593¹) + ... + ($10,285/1.0593⁵) = **$41,313 million**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $297,295 / (1.0593)⁵ = **$222,912 million**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $41,313 + $222,912 = $264,225 million**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   `Equity Value = $264,225M - ($55,892M Debt - $1,876M Cash)`
    *   **Equity Value = $210,209 million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Correction:** The equity value represents the claim of today's shareholders. Therefore, we must divide by the *current* diluted shares outstanding.
    *   `Fair Value Per Share = Equity Value / Current Diluted Shares`
    *   `Fair Value Per Share = $210,209 / 719`
    *   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value = $292.36**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $292.** (As calculated).
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $245.** (Assumes 2% revenue growth tapering to 0%, 43% op margin, and 17.0x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $340.** (Assumes 5% revenue growth tapering to 3%, 46% op margin, and 19.5x exit multiple).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 25% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate to account for forecast uncertainty.
    *   `MOS Price = $292.36 * (1 - 0.25)`
    *   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price = $219.27**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competitive Pressure:** The quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry is intensely competitive. Increased pressure from global and local rivals could impact pricing power and market share, threatening revenue growth.
2.  **Consumer Spending & Preferences:** McDonald's sales are sensitive to global macroeconomic conditions that affect consumer discretionary spending. A slowdown could directly impact store traffic. Furthermore, shifts in consumer preferences towards healthier options could pose a long-term headwind.
3.  **Input Cost Inflation:** Volatility in commodity prices (beef, poultry, packaging) and labor costs can compress margins if the company is unable to pass these costs onto franchisees and customers effectively.
4.  **Franchisee Relations:** The company's success is heavily dependent on the financial health and alignment of its independent franchisees. Disputes over fees, required capital expenditures, or operational changes can create significant business disruption.

final answer is 292.36 $
