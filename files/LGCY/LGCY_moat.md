**Analysis Date:** August 22, 2025
**Primary Sources Reviewed:**
*   Form 10-K, filed October 1, 2024 (for fiscal year ended June 30, 2024)
*   Form 10-Q, filed May 15, 2025 (for quarterly period ended March 31, 2025)

| **Total** | **100%** | | **1.28** |

### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Legacy Education Inc. shows limited evidence of network effects. While referrals from current students and graduates account for a portion of new enrollments, this is more indicative of a positive reputation than a true network effect where the value of the service increases with each new user. The company's value proposition is primarily based on the education and job placement services it provides, not on the connections between its students.
**Evidence:**
*   Referrals from current students, high school counselors, and satisfied graduates and their employers have historically represented approximately 36% of new enrollments. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for students are present but not exceptionally high. Students who have started a program would face the cost and inconvenience of transferring credits (if possible) and starting over at a new institution. However, there are no significant contractual lock-ins or technical barriers that would prevent a student from switching to a competitor. The primary switching cost is the sunk cost of tuition and time.
**Evidence:**
*   The company offers programs of varying lengths, from a few weeks to over two years, which implies a moderate level of commitment from students. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
*   The company's refund policy allows for partial refunds for students who withdraw before completing 60% of the program, which could lower the financial barrier to switching. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** There is no evidence to suggest that Legacy Education has a demonstrable per-unit cost advantage over its peers. The for-profit education industry is highly competitive, with numerous public and private institutions, some of which receive government subsidies that LGCY does not. The company's financial statements do not indicate a significant gross margin differential compared to the industry.
**Evidence:**
*   The company competes with traditional public and private two-year and four-year degree-granting accredited colleges and universities, other proprietary degree-granting accredited schools, and alternatives to higher education. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
*   Public institutions receive government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** Legacy Education's primary intangible assets are its accreditations and brand reputation within its local markets. The company relies on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, and service marks, but there is no mention of patents that would provide a significant competitive advantage. The accreditations are crucial for the company's operations but are standard requirements for participation in Title IV programs and are not unique to LGCY.
**Evidence:**
*   HDMC and CCC are accredited by ACCET through April 2029 and April 2025, respectively. Integrity is accredited by ABHES through February 2026. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
*   The company relies on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with third parties to protect its proprietary rights. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** Legacy Education has established a physical presence in several California locations, which provides a degree of efficient scale in those local markets. The company's campuses are strategically located near hospitals and clinics to facilitate externships and employment opportunities for its students. This dense local network could deter new entrants in the specific areas where LGCY operates.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's campuses are strategically located near hospitals and clinics to allow easy access for our students to externships and full-time employment opportunities. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
*   As of June 30, 2024, the company leases five properties in California for its academic and corporate operations. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** The company collects and utilizes student and employer data to improve its programs and placement services, but there is no indication that this data provides a significant or durable competitive advantage. The data collected is likely comparable to that of other institutions in the for-profit education sector, and there is no evidence of a proprietary dataset that is difficult to replicate.
**Evidence:**
*   The placement department maintains databases of potential employers throughout the country. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Legacy Education does not operate a platform business model and there is no evidence of third-party developer adoption, a complementary product marketplace, or a significant number of integrations that would create ecosystem effects. The company's business is a direct-to-consumer service offering.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business is described as providing career-focused, post-secondary education services. There is no mention of a platform or ecosystem strategy. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The for-profit education industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal, state, and accrediting agencies, which creates a significant barrier to entry for new competitors. Legacy Education's compliance with these regulations, including its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, provides a degree of protection from new entrants. However, these regulations also pose a significant risk to the company's ongoing operations.
**Evidence:**
*   As a provider of postsecondary education, we are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and accrediting agencies. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
*   To participate in the Title IV Programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate state education agencies, be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, and be certified by ED as an eligible institution. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The capital intensity of the business is moderate. The company leases its facilities, which reduces the need for significant upfront capital investment in real estate. However, there are costs associated with equipping the facilities with the necessary educational and training equipment. These assets are not highly specific and could likely be repurposed or sold if necessary.
**Evidence:**
*   The company does not own any property and leases its facilities in California. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
*   Property and equipment, net of accumulated depreciation, was approximately $0.99 million as of June 30, 2024. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** Revenue visibility is provided by student enrollments in programs of varying lengths. While tuition is generally paid upfront or in installments, the revenue is recognized over the course of the program. This provides some degree of predictability, but the company does not have long-term, multi-year contracts in the same way that a B2B software company might.
**Evidence:**
*   Tuition revenue is recognized ratably over the instruction period. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
*   The company's enrollment numbers provide a near-term outlook on revenue, with 2,187 students enrolled as of June 30, 2024. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **Aggregation**
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(1 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.24 + 0.20 + 0.10 + 0.00 + 0.18 + 0.04 + 0.04 = **1.28**

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 26.4 / 100

### **Mapping**
The weighted score of 26.4 falls within the 10-30 range, which maps to a final moat rating of 1.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is 3-5 years. This is primarily based on the company's accreditations and local brand recognition. The accreditations are subject to renewal every few years, which represents a key risk. The competitive landscape and regulatory environment are also subject to change, which could erode the company's position in the medium term.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in Title IV program eligibility, the 90/10 rule, or other regulations could significantly impact the company's revenue and ability to operate. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
2.  **Increased Competition:** Increased competition from public institutions offering free or low-cost programs, or from other for-profit providers, could put pressure on enrollments and tuition prices. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)
3.  **Loss of Accreditation:** The failure to maintain accreditation for any of its institutions or programs would result in a loss of Title IV eligibility and would have a material adverse effect on the business. (Form 10-K, October 1, 2024)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   Student enrollment growth (quarterly and annually)
*   Placement rates for graduates
*   Student retention rates
*   90/10 rule compliance percentage
*   Cohort default rates
*   Revenue per student
*   Marketing and advertising spend as a percentage of revenue
*   Accreditation status and renewal dates

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Legacy Education Inc. has a narrow moat based on its regulatory approvals and local brand recognition. The company's ability to participate in federal student aid programs is a significant barrier to entry for new competitors. However, the company faces substantial risks from potential regulatory changes and intense competition. The lack of significant network effects, switching costs, or cost advantages limits the company's competitive advantage. A lower-than-expected student placement rate or a change in the regulatory landscape could quickly erode the company's moat.
