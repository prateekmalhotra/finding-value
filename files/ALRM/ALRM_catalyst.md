*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Alarm.com's commercial, international, and energy hub businesses are experiencing rapid growth, approaching 30% of consolidated SaaS revenue and growing at approximately 25% year-over-year. This diversification reduces reliance on the residential market and provides a significant runway for growth.

As these segments become a larger portion of the business, their higher growth rates will have a more significant impact on the company's overall growth profile, potentially leading to a re-rating of the stock by investors.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026 (ongoing).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 20% YoY growth in these segments.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (Short)**

**1. International and Commercial Revenue Growth**

*   **Assumption:** The international and commercial segments, currently ~30% of SaaS revenue, grow at 25% annually, while the rest of the business grows at 5%. This would result in a blended SaaS revenue growth rate of ~11%.
*   **Valuation Impact:** If the market re-rates ALRM's valuation from its current P/S ratio to one that is more in line with a higher growth company, the stock could see a 10-20% upside. For example, a 15% increase in the P/S ratio would translate to a ~15% increase in the stock price, assuming all else is equal.

**2. Share Repurchase Program Execution**

*   **Assumption:** The company announces and executes a $100 million share repurchase program. At a market cap of ~$3 billion, this would reduce the share count by ~3.3%.
*   **Valuation Impact:** The 3.3% reduction in share count would lead to a 3.3% increase in EPS. Assuming a constant P/E ratio, this would translate to a 3.3% increase in the stock price. The announcement itself could also provide a 2-5% boost to the stock price, as it signals management's confidence.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The net balance of catalysts for ALRM in the near-term appears positive. The strong growth in the commercial and international segments is a clear, quantifiable catalyst that should continue to drive revenue and earnings growth. A potential share repurchase program, while not yet announced, is a reasonable expectation given the company's strong cash position and could provide additional support for the stock. While insider selling has been observed, it is not at a level that would suggest a lack of confidence from management.
