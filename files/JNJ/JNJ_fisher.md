Johnson & Johnson, August 24, 2025, Primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 29, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson has strong growth potential in both its Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. Key drugs in Oncology and Immunology, such as DARZALEX (19.8% growth in 2024) and TREMFYA (16.6% growth), continue to gain market share. The MedTech segment is being bolstered by strategic, high-growth acquisitions, including Shockwave Medical and Abiomed, which significantly expand the company's presence in the cardiovascular market. Products introduced within the last five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2024 sales, demonstrating a successful track record of refreshing the portfolio to drive future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a strong commitment to ongoing development through substantial investment in both internal and external innovation. In 2024, JNJ invested $17.2 billion in research and development, a 14.2% increase from the prior year and representing 19.4% of total sales. This internal focus is complemented by an active M&A strategy, with recent acquisitions of Shockwave Medical, Ambrx Biopharma, and Intra-Cellular Therapies aimed at acquiring new technologies and pipeline assets. The 2024 pipeline report lists over twenty major regulatory submissions and approvals, indicating a productive development engine.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000178/jnj-20250629.htm (Q2 2025 10-Q, filed July 2025)]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JNJ’s R&D efforts are highly effective. The company's R&D investment of 19.4% of revenue is competitive with industry peers, while its absolute spending of $17.2 billion in 2024 is second only to Merck. The most direct measure of its effectiveness is that products launched within the past five years account for approximately 25% of total 2024 revenue. This demonstrates a strong ability to convert its substantial R&D investment into commercially successful products that replace revenue from maturing lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH6rwf9HBuUcKqFM1TwvFLQNQsBWM9TzxLtgVzH2BlaNvr5nc8P-hsPNWbgLnqbFQbtqYEEPFkK7Hqc82HLCk0OmiDXm_ei4hmblsQGjmtNRfnly6TKLUrPYQjoRtDLJT4f1_KHs-Bq0BUNq1N9xneIs3AG1uKKO9LvgJaR3VZDZB9-PDFNvA== (Fierce Biotech, March 31, 2025)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JNJ's sales organization is demonstrably above average, effectively managing a vast and diversified portfolio on a global scale. The company operates in nearly every country and has the scale to penetrate markets deeply. The sales force has proven its ability to drive market share gains for key growth products like DARZALEX and ERLEADA against entrenched competition. The company also maintains strong strategic relationships with the three largest U.S. healthcare wholesalers, which together accounted for nearly 48% of gross revenues in 2024, ensuring broad and efficient distribution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JNJ maintains worthwhile profit margins that are competitive with its peers. In 2024, the company reported a gross profit margin of 69.1% and a pre-tax profit margin of 18.8%. The pre-tax margin compares favorably to an aggregate net profit margin of approximately 16.7% for 15 of the largest drug companies in the first quarter of 2024. JNJ's underlying operational profitability is even stronger, with segment earnings before tax reaching 25.5% of sales, demonstrating the strong earning power of its core businesses before significant litigation and other corporate costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHpZYCRCHS6fc0ivZun0h-yuCEgpklo866w_SNgORqmYBhLpRKWCfn0TdDHN2yzetF8F9f8HhpQGvG3DXEybAXTa5rAZqWoWKlXgO4cUBQhpIT3911eJhnf5Emm8FwoplgzcW6WrBeAOlB9yrBV257ZquHzsytw9bR0J-afboiZfuBJkiDuSv4884rXbmoxTYhzTDA== (Q1 2024 Industry Profit Report)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to improve long-term profitability. The most significant recent action was the 2023 spin-off of its lower-margin consumer health business, Kenvue, to focus the remaining company on the higher-margin Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. JNJ is also executing targeted restructuring programs, such as the ongoing initiative in its Orthopaedics franchise, which aims to improve efficiency by exiting certain markets and product lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JNJ appears to have outstanding relations with its employees, guided by its long-standing "Credo." Key metrics support this, including a low voluntary turnover rate of 6.3% in 2024 and a high employee engagement survey participation rate of 94%. The company invests in its workforce through global training programs and supports work-life balance with a flexible hybrid work model, "J&J Flex."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company benefits from a highly stable and experienced executive team, indicating excellent relations at the senior level. The senior leadership, including the CEO, CFO, and heads of the main business segments, possess exceptionally long tenures, most having joined the company in the 1990s or early 2000s. This stability and deep institutional knowledge suggest a cohesive and well-functioning executive team, further evidenced by the smooth CEO succession in 2022-2023.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JNJ has cultivated significant management depth below the CEO level. The company is formally run by a 10-person Executive Committee, which includes leaders for each business segment (Innovative Medicine, MedTech) and key functions like R&D, Supply Chain, and Legal. Biographies show a consistent pattern of promoting from within and providing leaders with broad experience across different business units and geographic regions, creating a deep bench of talent and mitigating key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's accounting controls and cost analysis capabilities appear to be robust and reliable. JNJ's independent auditor has provided an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting, and the company has no recent history of restatements due to accounting errors. Management provides detailed financial reporting at the segment level and further breaks down sales by specific product franchises and geographies, allowing for clear and granular analysis of business performance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JNJ's primary competitive advantage lies in its immense scale and diversification across both pharmaceuticals (Innovative Medicine) and medical devices (MedTech). This unique structure provides a diversified revenue base and insulates it from risks specific to a single sector, such as a major patent cliff or a change in device reimbursement policy. This diversification, combined with its global manufacturing and distribution footprint and its deep expertise in navigating complex regulatory environments, creates a formidable competitive moat that is difficult for more focused competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently prioritizes long-range growth over short-term profit maximization. This is clearly demonstrated by its large and growing R&D budget, which consumed 19.4% of sales in 2024, and its strategy of acquiring companies and technologies that require significant upfront investment but promise future growth. The company also undertakes periodic restructuring charges to optimize its portfolio for the future, knowingly taking a near-term earnings hit for a long-term benefit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, eliminating the need for dilutive equity financing. JNJ generated over $24 billion in operating cash flow in 2024 and maintains strong access to debt markets for funding large acquisitions. Rather than issuing stock, the company has a consistent history of returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share buybacks, having repurchased over $4.5 billion in stock in the 18 months ending June 29, 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)], [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000178/jnj-20250629.htm (Q2 2025 10-Q, filed July 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JNJ's management provides a high level of disclosure regarding both opportunities and challenges. The company's SEC filings contain extensive discussion of risks, including specific details on the expected negative impact of biosimilar competition for its top-selling drug, STELARA. Furthermore, the company provides voluminous detail regarding its significant legal challenges, such as the talc litigation, even creating a dedicated public website to communicate its position on the matter.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, filed early 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** This is the single criterion the company fails to meet. JNJ is involved in numerous, long-running, and high-cost legal proceedings related to its products and marketing practices, most notably the talc and opioid litigations. The company has accrued billions of dollars for potential settlements, and the talc litigation in particular, which involves allegations that the company's baby powder caused cancer, represents a significant challenge to the integrity of its products and conduct over many decades. The sheer scale and gravity of these legal issues prevent an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm (Fiscal Year 2024 10-K, Note 19, filed early 2025)]

---
**Synthesis**
Johnson & Johnson scores highly on nearly all of Fisher's points, reflecting its status as a blue-chip leader in the healthcare industry. Its key strengths are its diversified business model across Innovative Medicine and MedTech, its massive scale, its powerful R&D engine, and its exceptionally strong financial position. The management team is stable, deep, and focused on the long term. The primary and significant negative is the company's long-standing litigation exposure, particularly regarding talc product liability, which undermines the "unquestionable integrity" standard. The variables most likely to change this score in the next 12-24 months are, first and foremost, the legal proceedings; a definitive, comprehensive settlement of the talc litigation could begin to repair the reputational damage. Second, the successful integration and continued growth of its large acquisitions in the MedTech space, like Shockwave Medical, will be critical to validating its capital allocation strategy. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on integrity would require the full resolution of these major litigations without the emergence of new, similar issues.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
