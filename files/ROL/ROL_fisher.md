### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The global pest control market is projected to grow from USD 22.23 billion in 2024 to USD 36.21 billion by 2034, at a CAGR of 5.00%. This growth is driven by urbanization and increasing awareness of health and hygiene. Rollins, as a major player in this market, is well-positioned to benefit from these trends. The company's revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2025, were $1.82 billion, an 11.1% increase from the same period in 2024, indicating strong current demand for its services.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins' growth strategy heavily relies on acquisitions. In the first half of 2025, the company made 13 acquisitions, including the significant acquisition of Saela Holdings, LLC for $207.1 million. The company's 2024 annual report states a continued investment in sales and marketing to drive organic growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins states in its 2024 annual report that "expenditures on research activities relating to the development of new products or services are not significant." The company relies on relationships with manufacturers and suppliers for innovation. While this approach may be capital-efficient, it does not demonstrate a commitment to in-house R&D.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Rollins reported revenues of $1.82 billion, an 11.1% increase from 2024, with organic revenue growth of 7.4%. This strong growth across all service lines suggests an effective sales organization. Selling and marketing expenses have also increased to support growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Rollins' operating margin was 18.7%. While this is slightly down from 19.2% in the prior year, it still represents a healthy level of profitability. The company's gross profit margin remained stable at 52.7% in the first half of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins has demonstrated the ability to leverage costs in areas like materials, supplies, and employee expenses, which has helped to offset increased spending on fleet and marketing. The company is focused on improving the efficiency of its business model. For the second quarter of 2025, gross margin saw leverage in employee expenses and materials, although this was offset by higher insurance and fleet costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information on labor relations is not readily available in the provided documents. Without specific data on employee turnover, engagement, or labor disputes, a definitive "Yes" cannot be supported.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant executive turnover or disputes from the provided documents. The company has announced 10b5-1 trading plans for its Executive Chairman and CEO, which suggests a routine and orderly process for executive stock transactions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000069/rol-20250331.htm) (April 24, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided documents do not offer sufficient detail on the breadth and experience of the management team beyond the top executives. Without further information on succession planning or the backgrounds of key operational leaders, it's difficult to assess management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's quarterly filings provide a detailed breakdown of costs and expenses, suggesting a good handle on cost analysis. The company has also consistently filed its financial reports on time, and the reports include the standard certifications of the CEO and CFO regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins' aggressive and successful acquisition strategy is a key differentiator in the fragmented pest control industry. The company's ability to identify, acquire, and integrate smaller players allows it to expand its geographic footprint and customer base rapidly. The acquisition of Saela Pest Control is a recent example of this strategy in action.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Rollins is making significant investments in selling and marketing to drive long-term growth, even though these investments have had a negative near-term impact on operating margins. This willingness to sacrifice some short-term profitability for market share and revenue growth indicates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Rollins had a strong balance sheet with $1.44 billion in stockholders' equity. The company is funding its acquisitions through cash on hand and debt, including a commercial paper program and senior notes. The company has a share repurchase program in place, although no shares were repurchased in the first half of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section of the company's quarterly reports provides a balanced overview of the company's performance, acknowledging both positive and negative factors. For example, the company discusses the negative impact of higher fleet and insurance costs on margins. This transparency suggests a willingness to be candid with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided documents or recent news to suggest a lack of integrity in Rollins' management. The company is facing an investigation in California regarding compliance with environmental regulations, but the company states it does not believe the outcome will have a material effect.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm](https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/84839/000008483925000087/rol-20250630.htm) (July 24, 2025)

Synthesis:
Rollins scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its strong market position, growth strategy, and financial health. The company is a leader in the growing pest control industry and has a proven ability to grow both organically and through acquisitions. The primary areas of concern are the lack of significant in-house R&D, and the limited information on labor relations and management depth. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months by providing more disclosure on employee relations and management succession planning. A "No" on R&D could be flipped to a "Yes" if the company were to announce a significant investment in proprietary pest control technologies.

fisher score is 12 / 15
