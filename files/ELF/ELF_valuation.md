### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

While direct numerical guidance for the full fiscal year 2026 was not available in the provided snippets, the following commentary was extracted:

*   **Revenue Growth:** "ELF Beauty anticipates net sales growth above 9% for the first half of the fiscal year..." (Seeking Alpha, August 7, 2025)
*   **Margin Outlook:** "...adjusted EBITDA margins expected to be around 20%." (Seeking Alpha, August 7, 2025)
*   **General Outlook:** "As we look ahead, we see the potential to more than double our business over the coming years given the significant white space we see in color cosmetics, skin care and international." (Seeking Alpha, August 6, 2025)

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast:**
    *   **Year 1:** 15% (This is a conservative estimate above the 9% guidance for the first half of the year, factoring in the company's historical growth and "more than double our business" commentary.)
    *   **Years 2-5:** Declining from 15% to 10% by Year 5, reflecting a moderation of growth as the company scales.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin (EBIT):** 11.62% (Held constant at the TTM level, as there is no specific guidance for EBIT margin expansion, and the EBITDA margin guidance is "around 20%," which is consistent with the current EBIT margin plus D&A.)
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 25% (A normalized statutory rate, as the TTM effective tax rate of 34.5% seems unusually high.)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** 2.0% of revenue (Slightly above the TTM of 1.8%, reflecting continued investment in growth.)
    *   **Working Capital:** 5.0% of incremental revenue (Based on historical averages).
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** 5.0% of revenue (In line with the TTM of 5.1%).
    *   **Diluted Shares:** 58 million (Latest reported number, held constant for simplicity).

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**FCFF Formula:** EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | NOPAT | D&A | SBC | Capex | Change in WC | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 1,544.45 | 179.47 | 134.60 | 30.89 | 77.22 | -30.89 | -10.07 | 58.15 |
| 2 | 1,776.12 | 206.39 | 154.79 | 35.52 | 88.81 | -35.52 | -11.58 | 66.57 |
| 3 | 2,007.01 | 233.22 | 174.91 | 40.14 | 100.35 | -40.14 | -11.54 | 75.90 |
| 4 | 2,247.85 | 261.20 | 195.90 | 44.96 | 112.39 | -44.96 | -12.04 | 86.45 |
| 5 | 2,472.64 | 287.32 | 215.49 | 49.45 | 123.63 | -49.45 | -12.24 | 98.62 |

We use FCFF for valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.33% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.58 (Source: Finviz). This beta is justified as it reflects the company's higher-than-market volatility, which is characteristic of a high-growth consumer discretionary stock.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.33% + 1.58 * 5.0% = 12.23%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Interest Expense / Total Debt = $16.15M / $314.79M = 5.13%**
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.13% * (1 - 25%) = 3.85%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Cap:** $6.73B
    *   **Total Debt:** $0.31B
    *   **WACC = (6.73 / (6.73 + 0.31)) * 12.23% + (0.31 / (6.73 + 0.31)) * 3.85% = 11.75%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (In line with long-run inflation expectations).
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($98.62M * 1.025) / (11.75% - 2.5%) = $1,091.24M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $287.32M + $49.45M = $336.77M**
    *   A reasonable historical median multiple for a high-growth consumer brand might be in the 15-20x range. A conservative 15x exit multiple is chosen.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 15 * $336.77M = $5,051.55M**
    *   The Gordon Growth method results in a significantly lower, and therefore more conservative, terminal value. The lower value will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:**
    *   Year 1: $58.15M / (1.1175)^1 = $52.04M
    *   Year 2: $66.57M / (1.1175)^2 = $53.27M
    *   Year 3: $75.90M / (1.1175)^3 = $54.34M
    *   Year 4: $86.45M / (1.1175)^4 = $55.42M
    *   Year 5: $98.62M / (1.1175)^5 = $56.45M
    *   **Total PV of FCFF = $271.52M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $1,091.24M / (1.1175)^5 = $622.97M
*   **Enterprise Value = $271.52M + $622.97M = $894.49M**
*   **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $314.79M - $170.03M = $144.76M** (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025)
*   **Equity Value = $894.49M - $144.76M = $749.73M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $749.73M / 58M = $12.93**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Lower revenue growth (10% declining to 5%) and margin compression (10% EBIT margin) could result in a value closer to **$8 per share.**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Higher revenue growth (20% declining to 15%) and slight margin expansion (12.5% EBIT margin) could result in a value closer to **$20 per share.**
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value.
    *   **MOS Price = $12.93 * (1 - 0.30) = $9.05**

### **Risk Notes**

*   **Competition:** The beauty industry is highly competitive, with low barriers to entry.
*   **Execution Risk:** The company's high growth is dependent on its ability to continue to innovate and execute on its marketing strategy.
*   **Valuation:** The current market price of ELF is significantly higher than this back-of-the-envelope intrinsic value, suggesting the market has much higher growth and profitability expectations. The valuation is highly sensitive to the terminal growth rate and WACC assumptions.
*   **Tariffs and Supply Chain:** The company has exposure to tariffs on goods imported from China, which could impact margins.
*   **Consumer Spending:** As a consumer discretionary company, e.l.f. Beauty is susceptible to downturns in consumer spending.

final answer is 12.93 $
