RCI Hospitality Holdings, Inc., August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RCI Hospitality Holdings operates in the adult nightclub and sports bar/restaurant industries. The nightclub industry is highly fragmented, with an estimated 2,200 clubs in the U.S., providing a long runway for growth through consolidation. RCI is the only publicly traded company in this space, and it has a stated strategy of acquiring 3-5 new clubs per year. The company is also expanding its Bombshells restaurant and sports bar chain, with plans to open new locations and franchise the concept. In the second quarter of 2025, the company reported that it had 6 new Bombshells locations in development and that it had signed its first franchise agreement.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a clearly articulated growth strategy focused on acquiring and building new units. In addition to their nightclub acquisition strategy, they are expanding the Bombshells brand and have launched a new steakhouse concept, "RICK's," in Miami. The company is also investing in technology, with its AdmireMe platform, a subscription-based service that allows fans to interact with entertainers. In the second quarter of 2025, AdmireMe reached a milestone of over $2.0 million in monthly revenue.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RCI does not have traditional R&D expenses. However, its investments in new concepts and technologies can be viewed as a form of R&D. The company's new steakhouse concept and the development of the AdmireMe platform are examples of these investments. The early results from AdmireMe are promising, with the platform generating over $2.0 million in monthly revenue. However, it is too early to determine the long-term effectiveness of these initiatives.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales and marketing efforts are decentralized, with each club and restaurant responsible for its own local marketing. The company also has a national marketing program for the Bombshells brand. RCI has a loyalty program, the "Rick's Cabaret Rick's 100 Club," which offers members discounts and other perks. While same-store sales have been positive, there is limited publicly available information to fully assess the effectiveness of the company's sales organization compared to its peers.
**Answer:** No

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the second quarter of 2025, RCI reported a GAAP operating margin of 18.2%. The company has a history of strong profitability, with its nightclub segment, in particular, generating high margins. Management has stated a goal of achieving 20% adjusted EBITDA margins.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on several initiatives to improve margins. These include leveraging the company's scale to negotiate better purchasing agreements, implementing more efficient operating procedures at its clubs and restaurants, and growing its higher-margin businesses, such as the AdmireMe platform.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RCI's business model relies heavily on independent contractors (entertainers). The company has faced legal challenges related to the classification of its entertainers, and this remains a risk factor. There is limited public information available to fully assess the company's relationship with its employees and independent contractors.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's executive team has been stable, with the CEO, Eric Langan, having been with the company since 1998. The company's board of directors includes a mix of inside and independent directors. Insider ownership is high, which aligns the interests of management with those of shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's management team includes experienced operators in the nightclub and restaurant industries. However, there is a key-person risk associated with the CEO, Eric Langan, who has been instrumental in the company's growth and strategy.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RCI provides detailed segment reporting, which gives investors insight into the performance of its different business lines. The company's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm. However, the company has identified material weaknesses in its internal controls in the past.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RCI's key competitive advantages include its ownership of real estate and its portfolio of liquor licenses, which are difficult to obtain in many jurisdictions. The company's scale also gives it an advantage in acquiring new clubs and in negotiating with suppliers. As the only publicly traded company in the adult nightclub industry, RCI has access to capital markets that its smaller, privately-held competitors do not.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a long-term capital allocation strategy that is focused on creating shareholder value. The company has a disciplined approach to acquisitions and is willing to invest in new concepts that may take time to mature. The company also has a share repurchase program, which indicates that management believes the company's stock is undervalued.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RCI has a history of using debt to finance its acquisitions. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $22.6 million in cash and $476.3 million in debt. The company's debt-to-equity ratio is relatively high, which could limit its ability to take on additional debt. However, the company generates strong free cash flow, and it has a share repurchase program in place, which reduces the risk of dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is accessible to investors and provides detailed commentary on the company's performance during its quarterly earnings calls. The company also provides a supplemental data package with additional information on its operations. Management has been open about the challenges it has faced, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the legal challenges related to the classification of its entertainers.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has been involved in a number of legal and regulatory disputes, including lawsuits related to the classification of its entertainers and investigations by the SEC. While the company has resolved many of these issues, they raise concerns about the company's corporate governance and the integrity of its management.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
RCI Hospitality Holdings exhibits strengths in its long-term growth potential, commitment to development, profitability, and transparent investor communications. The company's unique position as the only publicly traded entity in a fragmented industry provides a clear path for growth through consolidation. However, the score is negatively impacted by concerns regarding labor relations, management depth, accounting controls, and legal/regulatory issues. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months include a resolution of the independent contractor classification issue, the successful franchising of the Bombshells brand, and the sustained growth of the AdmireMe platform. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" on the issue of management integrity if the company can avoid further legal and regulatory scrutiny and on the issue of labor relations with a clear and positive resolution to the classification of its entertainers.

fisher score is 9 / 15
