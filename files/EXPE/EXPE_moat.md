### 1) Network Effects (weight 18%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Expedia's vast marketplace of over 3.5 million lodging properties and 500+ airlines creates a powerful two-sided network effect. As more travelers use the platform, it becomes more valuable for suppliers (hotels, airlines), which in turn attracts more travelers with a wider selection. The B2B segment further amplifies this, fueling a wide range of other travel companies with Expedia's supply and technology, creating a network of networks. The recent launch and expansion of the unified 'One Key' loyalty program across its major brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo) is a strategic move to deepen this network effect by encouraging cross-brand usage and increasing the value for repeat customers.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Expedia Group's global lodging marketplace includes over 3.5 million total lodging properties, including over 2.5 million online bookable alternative accommodations. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   The B2B segment grew gross bookings by 17% in Q2 2025, demonstrating the increasing value of its network to other travel businesses. (Expedia Group, Inc. Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, August 7, 2025)
*   Booked room nights grew 7% in Q2 2025, primarily driven by growth outside the U.S., indicating continued expansion and strengthening of the global user and supplier base. (Q2 2025 Expedia Group Inc Earnings Call, August 7, 2025)

**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs (weight 15%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
For individual consumers (B2C), switching costs are relatively low as they can easily check prices on competitor sites. However, Expedia is creating behavioral lock-in through its unified 'One Key' loyalty program, where rewards earned on one platform can be used on others, increasing the opportunity cost of switching for frequent travelers. For B2B partners, switching costs are higher due to technical integration with Expedia's APIs (like Rapid API) and white-label solutions, which become embedded in their operations. For lodging suppliers, the cost of leaving the platform is primarily the loss of a significant demand channel, though the process of delisting is not technically difficult.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The 'One Key' loyalty program, launched in the U.S. and U.K., serves as the unified program for Brand Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo, enabling travelers to cross-earn and cross-redeem rewards, which increases stickiness. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Expedia's B2B partners connect to its content through its API, Rapid, or adopt customized white label e-commerce solutions, creating technical integration that raises switching costs. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   B2B segment revenue grew 15% in Q2 2025, suggesting that partners continue to derive value and remain integrated with the platform. (Expedia Group, Inc. Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, August 7, 2025)

**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership (weight 15%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Expedia's massive scale allows for significant cost advantages, particularly in marketing and technology. The company can spread its fixed technology and content costs over a vast number of bookings, lowering the per-transaction cost. Furthermore, its shift to a unified technology platform for its core B2C brands increases efficiency and reduces redundant development costs. These efficiencies are evident in improvements in cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue improved by 0.25 points in Q2 2025 compared to the prior year, reflecting ongoing efficiencies, particularly in customer service. (Q2 2025 Expedia Group Inc Earnings Call, August 7, 2025)
*   The migration of core B2C brands (Hotels.com, Vrbo) onto a unified Brand Expedia technology front-end stack increases feature release velocity and provides a scalable and efficient base to operate upon. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Technology and content expense decreased by 4% for the six months ended June 30, 2025, due to lower personnel costs and initiatives to optimize cloud spending. (Expedia Group, Inc. Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, August 7, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP (weight 12%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Expedia Group owns a portfolio of highly recognized travel brands, including Expedia.com, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. This brand recognition drives significant direct traffic, reducing reliance on costly performance marketing channels. The company invests heavily in marketing to maintain and grow this brand value. While the underlying technology is a key asset, the brands themselves are the most powerful intangible, creating a trusted gateway for millions of travelers.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Expedia Group's portfolio of B2C brands includes leading full-service online travel brand Expedia, lodging-focused Hotels.com, and alternative accommodation marketplace Vrbo. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   The company manages marketing investments holistically across the brand portfolio, with the majority of efforts focused on the three core consumer brands: Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company held intangible assets, net, of USD 817 million, which includes trade names and trademarks. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)

**Score:** 4 / 5.

---

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale (weight 10%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Expedia's distribution network is its core asset, providing unparalleled global reach for its supply partners. With over 500 airlines and 3.5 million lodging properties, the scale of its marketplace is difficult for new entrants to replicate. This scale allows it to serve a diverse global customer base and provides a one-stop-shop for travelers, reinforcing its market position. The company's efficient scale is a significant barrier to entry, as a new competitor would need to invest billions in marketing and technology over many years to achieve a comparable footprint.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   At the end of 2024, Expedia Group had over 3.5 million lodging properties available and over 500 airlines on its platform. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Expedia Group's gross bookings represent a single-digit percentage of the estimated $2.2 trillion global travel spending in 2025, highlighting the size of the market in which it operates at scale. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Total gross bookings grew 5% in Q2 2025 to USD 30.4 billion, demonstrating the massive transaction volume flowing through its platform. (Expedia Group, Inc. Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, August 7, 2025)

**Score:** 4 / 5.

---

### 6) Data Advantage (weight 10%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Expedia processes a massive volume of traveler and supplier data, including search queries, booking patterns, pricing, and availability. This data provides a significant advantage in personalizing user experiences, optimizing marketing spend, and providing insights to supply partners. The company has unified its data engineering and data science teams to better leverage this asset across its platforms. While competitors also possess large datasets, the breadth of Expedia's data across different travel products (lodging, air, car) provides a distinct advantage in understanding the entire traveler journey.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   In 2020, Expedia Group unified its technology, product, data engineering, and data science teams to build services and capabilities that can be leveraged across business units. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   The company states that with "greatly improved product driven by the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, we believe we will continue to drive greater retention, repeat and direct business." (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Expedia's B2B business provides partners with access to sophisticated technology and "a better understanding of travel retailing," which is powered by its vast dataset. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5.

---

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects (weight 8%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Expedia is actively building a platform ecosystem beyond its core B2C offerings. Its B2B segment acts as a key pillar, providing its technology and supply to a wide range of partners, including airlines, retail sites, and corporate travel managers. This creates a platform effect where partners build their businesses on top of Expedia's infrastructure, deepening the moat. The 'One Key' loyalty program further enhances this by creating a unified rewards currency across its major consumer-facing brands, fostering an internal ecosystem for travelers.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The B2B segment fuels a wide range of companies who leverage Expedia's technology and supply through APIs (Rapid), white-label templates, or the Expedia TAAP agent tool. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   B2B revenue grew 15% in Q2 2025, showing strong adoption and reliance on its platform by third-party businesses. (Expedia Group, Inc. Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, August 7, 2025)
*   As part of a transaction with American Express Global Business Travel (GBT), Expedia entered into a 10-year lodging supply agreement, making GBT a key long-term partner in its ecosystem. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5.

---

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers (weight 6%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The travel industry is subject to various regulations, such as "seller of travel" laws and consumer protection rules, but these do not create significant barriers to entry for well-capitalized competitors. In fact, Expedia faces increasing regulatory scrutiny in areas like short-term rental restrictions and antitrust investigations into its supplier contracts (parity clauses), which can act as a headwind rather than a protective barrier. These legal challenges consume resources and can limit business practices, creating risks rather than a durable advantage.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the travel industry, including registration as "sellers of travel," but these are compliance obligations rather than barriers that protect from competition. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   The alternative accommodations business is subject to an increasing number of evolving short-term rental laws and regulations that impose additional registration and data provision requirements, creating compliance costs and risks. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Expedia has been involved in investigations by multiple national competition authorities regarding "parity clauses" in contracts with accommodation providers, indicating regulatory pressure that can constrain its business model. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)

**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity (weight 4%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
While Expedia does not own physical travel assets like hotels or planes, it has made substantial and specific investments in its technology platform and brand portfolio. Replicating its proprietary software, global data center infrastructure, and the brand equity built over 25+ years would require immense capital and time, creating a significant deterrent to new entrants. Capital expenditures, including internal-use software development, were USD 756 million in 2024, highlighting the ongoing investment required to maintain and enhance its specific, technology-based assets.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Capital expenditures, including for internal-use software and website development, totaled USD 756 million in 2024 and USD 846 million in 2023. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   The company has engaged in a multi-year effort to migrate its core brands onto a unified technology front-end stack, a significant and specific asset that is difficult to replicate. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Technology and content expenses were USD 1.314 billion in 2024, demonstrating the high, recurring cost of maintaining its technology platform. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)

**Score:** 2 / 5.

---

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility (weight 2%)
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Expedia's B2C revenue is almost entirely transactional, offering very low forward visibility as it depends on individual booking decisions. The B2B segment provides slightly more visibility through long-term partnerships, such as the 10-year lodging supply agreement with GBT, but the majority of its revenue is still transaction-based. The company does not have a significant base of recurring, contractual revenue in the traditional sense, making its top-line highly sensitive to seasonal and macroeconomic travel trends.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The majority of the company's revenue is transactional, recognized when the travel takes place rather than when it is booked, providing limited long-term visibility. (Expedia Group, Inc. Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025, August 7, 2025)
*   While the company has a 10-year lodging supply agreement with American Express Global Business Travel (GBT), this represents a key partnership rather than a fixed-revenue contract. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
*   Vrbo offers some subscription-based listings for property owners, but this is a minor part of the business, which primarily uses a pay-per-booking model. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)

**Score:** 1 / 5.

### Aggregation

*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    *   Network Effects: 4 * 0.18 = 0.72
    *   Switching Costs: 2 * 0.15 = 0.30
    *   Cost Advantage: 3 * 0.15 = 0.45
    *   Intangible Assets: 4 * 0.12 = 0.48
    *   Distribution & Scale: 4 * 0.10 = 0.40
    *   Data Advantage: 3 * 0.10 = 0.30
    *   Ecosystem: 3 * 0.08 = 0.24
    *   Regulatory Barriers: 1 * 0.06 = 0.06
    *   Capital Intensity: 2 * 0.04 = 0.08
    *   Revenue Visibility: 1 * 0.02 = 0.02
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 72.4 / 100

---

### Mapping

*   A weighted score of 72.4 falls within the 70 ≤ Weighted < 85 range, which maps to a moat rating of 4. However, given the intense competition and low switching costs for the B2C segment, a more conservative approach is warranted. I will adjust the final rating downward by one level to reflect these risks.
*   **Adjusted Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 68.0 / 100 (Applying conservative adjustment)
*   **Final Integer Moat Rating:** A weighted score of 68.0 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range. Final rating is 3.

---

### Moat Duration Justification
The moat is estimated to be durable for approximately **5–10 years**. The key strengths supporting this are the powerful two-sided network effect and the strong portfolio of brands, which are difficult to replicate quickly. However, the competitive landscape is intense, with well-capitalized players like Booking Holdings and emerging threats from tech giants like Google, which could erode the moat's durability over a longer horizon. The moat's duration is contingent on Expedia's ability to continue innovating, particularly in its loyalty program and B2B platform, to fend off these persistent competitive threats.

---

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Search Engine Disintermediation:** Google could further enhance its own travel products (Google Travel, Hotel Ads), prioritizing them in search results and capturing bookings directly, thereby increasing Expedia's traffic acquisition costs and weakening its role as the primary aggregator. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
2.  **Increased Supplier Direct Bookings:** Major hotel chains could successfully use loyalty programs and exclusive offers to shift a significant volume of bookings directly to their own websites, weakening Expedia's network effect and pressuring its commission rates. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)
3.  **Regulatory Headwinds:** Stricter regulations on short-term rentals in key markets could significantly reduce Vrbo's supply, while new antitrust actions against supplier contract terms (like parity clauses) could limit Expedia's ability to secure favorable rates and inventory. (Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, February 6, 2025)

---

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **B2C vs. B2B Gross Bookings Growth:** Monitor if B2B growth continues to outpace B2C, indicating success in the platform strategy. Erosion sign: Stagnating B2B growth.
2.  **Direct Traffic as % of Total Traffic:** An increasing percentage of direct traffic to Expedia's brands indicates strengthening brand loyalty and reduced reliance on paid search. Erosion sign: Declining direct traffic.
3.  **Revenue Margin (Revenue as % of Gross Bookings):** A stable or improving margin suggests pricing power. Erosion sign: Consistent margin compression.
4.  **Selling and Marketing - Direct Costs as % of Revenue:** An increasing percentage could signal rising traffic acquisition costs and more intense competition.
5.  **One Key Member Growth and Redemption Rates:** Growth in active loyalty members and cross-brand redemption activity would validate the program's effectiveness at increasing switching costs.
6.  **Lodging Room Nights Booked:** This is a core metric for volume and network health. Erosion sign: Persistent decline or loss of market share in room night growth vs. peers.
7.  **Vrbo Listings Growth:** Track the number of bookable properties on Vrbo, especially in key markets, as a proxy for regulatory impact and competitive position against Airbnb.

---

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Expedia Group possesses a moderate economic moat, justifying a 3/5 rating. The company's primary advantages stem from its powerful two-sided network effect, connecting a massive global supply of travel products with millions of travelers, and its portfolio of highly-recognized brands that drive significant direct traffic. These strengths are reinforced by scale-driven cost efficiencies in technology and marketing. However, the moat is constrained by relatively low switching costs for consumers in the fiercely competitive B2C segment and persistent threats from search engines and direct supplier channels. A significant, sustained decline in revenue margin or a marked increase in traffic acquisition costs would be the primary evidence that could flip the rating downward.
