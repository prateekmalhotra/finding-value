### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Key guidance from the Q2 2025 earnings call on July 16, 2025:

*   **Full Year 2025 Revenue:** "If you piece it all together for total ASML, we're looking at approximately 15% increase for 2025 in terms of revenue over last year."
*   **Full Year 2025 Gross Margin:** "We expect a gross margin of approximately 52% for the full year."
*   **Q3 2025 Revenue:** "For Q3, we expect revenue between €7.4 billion and €7.9 billion."
*   **Q3 2025 Gross Margin:** "We expect a gross margin between 50%-52%."

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** Revenue is projected to grow by 15%, the midpoint of management's guidance. (Q2 2025 Transcript, July 16, 2025)
    *   **Years 2-5:** Growth is projected to moderate to 10% annually. This is a conservative estimate based on the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and potential macroeconomic headwinds, while still acknowledging ASML's strong market position and the growth of AI.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 34.82%. We will use a slightly more conservative 3-year average of 32.8% for the forecast period, assuming stable profitability.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** The average tax rate over the last three years has been approximately 16%. We will use this rate for the forecast period. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex is 6.1% of revenue. We will maintain this percentage for the forecast, assuming capital intensity remains consistent with historical levels. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   **Working Capital:** The TTM change in working capital as a percentage of revenue is low at 0.45%. We will use a more normalized 3-year average of 1.5% of incremental revenue going forward.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** Treated as a real cash expense. It is historically around 0.6% of revenue, which will be used for the forecast.
    *   **Share Count:** The latest diluted weighted-average share count of 392 million will be used for the final per-share value calculation.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions EUR) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 37,000 | 40,700 | 44,770 | 49,247 | 54,172 |
| EBIT (32.8%) | 12,136 | 13,350 | 14,685 | 16,153 | 17,768 |
| NOPAT | 10,194 | 11,214 | 12,335 | 13,569 | 14,925 |
| D&A | 1,023 | 1,125 | 1,238 | 1,362 | 1,498 |
| SBC | 222 | 244 | 269 | 295 | 325 |
| Capex | 2,257 | 2,483 | 2,731 | 3,004 | 3,304 |
| Change in WC | 73 | 56 | 61 | 67 | 73 |
| **FCFF** | **8,665** | **9,556** | **10,512** | **11,565** | **12,721** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.5% (Approximate current 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield, a proxy for a long-term risk-free rate). (Bloomberg, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. This is a standard assumption for a mature market.
    *   **Beta:** 1.26. Sourced from Yahoo Finance (5-year monthly). A beta greater than 1 suggests that ASML is more volatile than the overall market, which is reasonable given its cyclical industry and high-growth nature.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.5% + 1.26 * 5.0% = 10.8%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt = €162.6M / €3,699M = 4.4%**
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.4% * (1 - 16%) = 3.7%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** €288,276M (392M shares * €735.40 share price)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** €3,699M (Book value is used as a proxy)
    *   **Total Value (V) = E + D = €291,975M**
    *   **WACC = (E/V) * Cost of Equity + (D/V) * After-Tax Cost of Debt**
    *   **WACC = (288,276/291,975) * 10.8% + (3,699/291,975) * 3.7% = 10.7%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This rate is a proxy for long-term global GDP growth and inflation, a reasonable assumption for a mature, market-leading company.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   **Terminal Value = (€12,721 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.107 - 0.025) = €159,004M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = €17,768M + €1,498M = €19,266M**
    *   ASML's historical 5-year median EV/EBITDA multiple is in the 20-25x range. A conservative 20x multiple is used.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = €19,266M * 20 = €385,320M**
    *   The Gordon Growth method results in a more conservative terminal value and will be used for the base case.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:** €39,091M (Sum of discounted FCFFs from Year 1-5)
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** €95,502M (€159,004M / (1 + 10.7%)^5)
*   **Enterprise Value = €39,091M + €95,502M = €134,593M**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
*   **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = €3,699M - €7,244M = -€3,545M**
*   **Equity Value = €134,593M - (-€3,545M) = €138,138M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **€138,138M / 392M shares = €352.39 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** €352.39. Assumes 15% revenue growth in Year 1, followed by 10% growth and stable margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** €280. Assumes lower revenue growth (10% then 7%), and slight margin compression, resulting in a lower valuation.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** €450. Assumes higher revenue growth (18% then 12%) driven by strong AI demand and some margin expansion, resulting in a higher valuation.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate.
    *   **MOS Price = €352.39 * (1 - 0.30) = €246.67**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Geopolitical Risk:** Heightened trade tensions, particularly related to China, could lead to further export restrictions, impacting a significant portion of ASML's revenue.
2.  **Cyclical Industry:** The semiconductor industry is subject to significant cyclicality. A downturn in demand could lead to order cancellations and push out revenue recognition.
3.  **Customer Concentration:** ASML relies on a small number of large customers (e.g., TSMC, Samsung, Intel). Any reduction in capital expenditures from these key clients would materially impact results.
4.  **Technological Execution:** ASML's leadership depends on continued R&D success and the successful rollout of next-generation technologies like High-NA EUV. Delays or performance issues could erode its competitive advantage.
5.  **Supply Chain Constraints:** The complexity of ASML's machines makes it vulnerable to disruptions in its global supply chain for critical components.
