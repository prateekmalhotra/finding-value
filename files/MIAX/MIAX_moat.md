### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Exchanges are classic examples of network effects; liquidity begets more liquidity. As more participants trade on MIAX's exchanges, it deepens the order book, tightens spreads, and attracts more participants, creating a virtuous cycle. The company's consistent and rapid growth in trading volumes is direct evidence of this strengthening network.
**Evidence:**
*   Average daily volume in U.S. options on MIAX Exchanges grew from 1.0 million contracts in 2015 to 6.7 million in 2024, a compound annual growth rate of 23.5%.
*   For the six months ended June 30, 2025, average daily volume in U.S. options was 8.7 million contracts, a significant increase from 6.5 million in the same period of 2024.
*   MIAX has grown to be the 14th largest global derivatives exchange operator as of June 30, 2025, based on the number of contracts traded.
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for trading firms are material, involving technical integration, and adapting to new rulebooks and API specifications. While firms connect to multiple exchanges, dropping an established connection like MIAX for a new entrant involves significant operational effort and testing, creating stickiness.
**Evidence:**
*   MIAX operates four distinct U.S. equity options exchanges (MIAX Options, MIAX Pearl, MIAX Emerald, and MIAX Sapphire), each with its own technical specifications that members must integrate with.
*   The launch of MIAX Sapphire in August 2024 with a trading floor to follow in September 2025 introduces physical and logistical components that deepen integration for floor members.
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** As a private entity, MIAX does not disclose sufficient financial data to definitively prove a per-unit cost advantage over peers. However, its modern, scalable technology infrastructure, developed in-house, likely provides some efficiency benefits. This score is conservatively low due to the lack of transparent evidence.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states it scaled and leveraged the technology built for its core options systems to launch its equities and futures platforms, suggesting scalable, proprietary technology.
*   No public documents are available to compare gross margins or cost-per-trade metrics against peers like CBOE or Nasdaq.
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** MIAX's primary intangible assets are its proprietary trading technology, exchange licenses, and growing brand recognition within the derivatives space. While not as established as centuries-old exchanges, its brand is strengthening, and its in-house technology is a core asset.
**Evidence:**
*   The company developed its own MIAX Futures Onyx trading system, which launched on June 29, 2025, demonstrating proprietary technology.
*   The company operates under the "MIAX" brand across multiple asset classes (options, equities, futures), building brand recognition.
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** The U.S. options and equities markets are highly concentrated, representing an efficiently scaled market where only a few large players can operate profitably. MIAX has successfully penetrated this market and established itself as a significant operator, making it difficult for a new entrant to replicate its position and connectivity.
**Evidence:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, MIAX is the 14th largest global derivatives exchange operator by contract volume.
*   The structure of the U.S. exchange market, with a limited number of operators, acts as a barrier to entry, protecting the scale of existing players like MIAX.
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** Exchanges are powerful data-generating businesses. MIAX collects vast amounts of proprietary market data (bids, asks, trades), which it can sell to market participants. This creates a valuable, high-margin revenue stream and a dataset that is impossible for non-exchange entities to replicate.
**Evidence:**
*   The nature of exchange operations involves the creation of proprietary data feeds, which are a standard industry product and revenue source.
*   The acquisition of MIAXdx in May 2023 was a strategic move to access the U.S. futures market and, by extension, its associated data.
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** MIAX's ecosystem is primarily composed of its member trading firms. While it has expanded its platform across asset classes (options, equities, futures), it has not yet demonstrated a strong third-party developer ecosystem or complementary product marketplace on the scale of larger competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's growth has been driven by launching new exchanges and acquiring others, such as Dorman Trading in October 2022, to expand its platform reach.
*   There is no evidence in public documents of a significant third-party application or partner ecosystem built on top of the MIAX platform.
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** This is one of MIAX's strongest advantages. Operating a national securities exchange in the U.S. requires extensive and ongoing approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This regulatory barrier is extremely high and effectively limits the market to a small number of approved players.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's exchanges, such as MIAX Options and MIAX Pearl Equities, are described as "SEC regulated exchanges."
*   Gaining SEC approval for a new national securities exchange is a multi-year, capital-intensive process with no guarantee of success, deterring potential new entrants.
**Score:** 5 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** Building and maintaining a modern, high-frequency trading platform is a highly capital-intensive endeavor requiring specific, sunk investments in technology, data centers, and network infrastructure. This high initial and ongoing cost deters new competition.
**Evidence:**
*   The company has organically launched four options exchanges and an equities exchange, and also made several acquisitions, indicating significant capital deployment.
*   The launch of a physical trading floor in Miami in 2025 represents a substantial and specific capital investment.
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** Exchange revenues are primarily transaction-based and thus tied to market volumes, which can be volatile. While connectivity and data sales provide some recurring elements, a large portion of revenue lacks long-term contractual certainty. The score is low due to this inherent volatility.
**Evidence:**
*   Company disclosures focus on trading volumes (average daily contracts), which are variable, as the primary business driver.
*   There is no mention of long-term, fixed-fee contracts with customers that would provide high revenue visibility.
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (4 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.08) + (5 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0.72 + 0.45 + 0.30 + 0.36 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.16 + 0.30 + 0.16 + 0.04 = **3.09**
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 61.8 / 100 (This is an equivalent representation of the 3.09 sum)

### **Mapping**
*   The weighted score of 61.8 falls within the 50–70 range.
*   **Mapping:** 50 ≤ 61.8 < 70 → moat rating = 3.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The moat's durability is estimated at 10–12 years. This is primarily underpinned by the stability of the U.S. regulatory framework for exchanges, which is unlikely to change materially in the medium term. The moat's duration is constrained by the pace of technological innovation in trading, where a disruptive new technology could emerge and render existing platforms less efficient over a decade-long horizon.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Regulatory Shift:** A significant deregulation of the exchange landscape by the SEC could lower barriers to entry, allowing new, lower-cost competitors to emerge and erode MIAX's market share.
2.  **Technological Disruption:** A competitor could develop a materially faster or more efficient trading architecture, causing liquidity and volume to migrate away from MIAX's platforms.
3.  **Aggressive Competition:** Larger, more established competitors (e.g., CBOE, Nasdaq) could use their deeper capital resources to subsidize trading or acquire innovative technology, squeezing MIAX's margins and growth.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **U.S. Options Market Share:** An increase strengthens the moat; a sustained decline below 15% would signal erosion.
*   **Average Daily Contract Volume:** Consistent growth is positive; stagnation or decline relative to the overall market is a negative signal.
*   **Revenue from Non-Transaction Sources (e.g., Market Data):** Growth in this area indicates successful diversification and a strengthening data moat.
*   **Launch of New Products:** Successful introduction of new proprietary derivatives (like futures products) indicates innovation and strengthens the platform.
*   **Operating Margins (if ever disclosed):** A decline could signal intense price competition.
*   **Number of Member Firms:** Growth is a positive sign of network health.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Miami International Holdings, Inc. has a solid, defensible moat, warranting a 3/5 rating. Its primary advantages are the formidable regulatory barriers to entry inherent in the U.S. exchange industry and the powerful network effects created by its growing liquidity pools. These are complemented by high capital intensity and customer switching costs. The moat is constrained by intense competition from larger players and a lack of clear evidence of a sustainable cost advantage. A significant and sustained loss of market share to these larger competitors or a fundamental shift in exchange regulation would be the primary evidence that would justify a rating downgrade.

moat rating is 3 / 5
