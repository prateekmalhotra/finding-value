### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. New Customer Acquisition & Expanded Distribution**

*   **Assumption:** The company secures a new national retail partner, adding 2,000 stores.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Current annual revenue: $32 million (FY 2024)
    *   Estimated revenue per store: $10,667 ($32M / 3,000 stores)
    *   Additional revenue: 2,000 stores * $10,667/store = $21.3 million
    *   New total revenue: $32 million + $21.3 million = $53.3 million
*   **Valuation Impact:** Assuming a constant Price-to-Sales ratio, a 66% increase in revenue could lead to a similar increase in the stock price.

**2. New Product Line Expansion**

*   **Assumption:** Successful launch of a new product line generating $15 million in new annual revenue.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Current annual revenue: $32 million (FY 2024)
