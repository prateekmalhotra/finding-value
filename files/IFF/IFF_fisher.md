Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K for FY2024, 10-Q for Q2 2025), Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF operates in the resilient consumer staples sector, with its ingredients being essential components for food, beverage, health, and personal care products. The company's 2024 10-K highlights long-term growth drivers including increasing consumer demand for natural, sustainable, and health-oriented products, as well as growth in emerging markets. Management noted in its Q2 2025 earnings call on August 6, 2025, that volume trends are improving sequentially, particularly in the Scent and Health & Biosciences divisions. While the overall market is mature, IFF's innovation pipeline is focused on high-growth areas like plant-based proteins and wellness ingredients, suggesting avenues for continued expansion.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF's management is actively pursuing portfolio optimization, which includes divesting non-core assets to focus on high-growth, high-margin businesses. The sale of its Pharma Solutions business is a key example of this strategy. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, the CEO emphasized a renewed focus on R&D and innovation to drive organic growth. The company's 2024 10-K outlines a strategy centered on customer-centric innovation and leveraging its integrated technology platforms to create new solutions. This demonstrates a clear commitment to evolving the product portfolio beyond its current state.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year 2024, IFF invested approximately $560 million in R&D, representing about 5.0% of its sales, as disclosed in its 2024 10-K. This is broadly in line with key competitors like Givaudan and Symrise, who typically spend in the 5-7% range of sales on R&D. While spending is comparable, the company has been focused on improving the commercialization of its R&D pipeline. The recent portfolio changes are intended to better focus these R&D dollars. However, concrete evidence of superior returns on this spending, such as a string of recent blockbuster product launches, is not readily apparent in recent reports.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF's business model relies on a deeply integrated relationship between its sales, R&D, and creative teams to co-develop products with customers. This "win" rate and customer stickiness are critical. The company's 2024 10-K describes its long-standing relationships with many of the world's largest consumer products companies as a key strength. However, the company has experienced volume declines and market share challenges in certain segments over the past two years, as acknowledged in recent earnings calls. While the integrated model is strong, recent performance suggests the sales organization is performing at an average, not above-average, level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm (Filed February 28, 2025)], [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IFF/transcripts/ (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 6, 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of the second quarter ending June 30, 2025, IFF reported a gross margin of 31.8%. The company's adjusted operating EBITDA margin was 16.5%. These margins have been under pressure due to inflation, supply chain disruptions, and costs associated with its large-scale M&A activity and subsequent integration and restructuring efforts. Competitors have often posted stronger margins, and IFF's current profitability is below its historical peaks. Therefore, while substantial, the profit margins are not currently at a level that could be considered "worthwhile" relative to the company's potential or its primary peers.
**Answer:** No

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has made margin improvement a central pillar of its current strategy. The Q2 2025 earnings call and presentation detailed a multi-pronged approach: executing pricing actions to offset inflation, driving productivity gains through cost-cutting initiatives, and optimizing the portfolio by divesting lower-margin businesses. The ongoing restructuring program is designed to create a leaner cost structure. These actions are beginning to show results, with management noting sequential margin improvement and forecasting continued progress.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF's 2024 10-K notes that as of December 31, 2024, approximately 40% of its employees were represented by unions or works councils. The company states its belief that its relations with employees are "good." There have been no recent, widespread reports of major labor disputes or strikes in reputable news sources. The company emphasizes safety and employee well-being in its public disclosures. Without evidence of significant conflict or unusually high turnover, relations appear stable, though there isn't sufficient public evidence to classify them as "outstanding."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm (Filed February 28, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF has experienced significant executive turnover in the last few years, including a CEO transition in early 2024. While the new CEO has brought in a new leadership team to execute a turnaround plan, this level of change indicates a period of instability rather than outstanding, long-term cohesion. The new team appears to be aligned and is communicating a clear strategy, as seen in recent earnings calls. However, a sustained period of stable execution is needed to demonstrate outstanding relations.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has recently refreshed its leadership team under the new CEO, appointing new presidents for its core business divisions. The 2024 10-K and company website list a full slate of executives with significant industry experience from companies like DuPont, Nestle, and Givaudan. This suggests a strong bench of talent has been assembled. The divisional structure allows for operational leadership below the C-suite, providing a degree of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF's financial statements are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which issued an unqualified opinion for the fiscal year 2024, indicating the financial statements are fairly presented. The 2024 10-K includes a statement on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, concluding that it was effective as of December 31, 2024. There is no history of major restatements or accounting scandals. The company provides detailed segment reporting, giving investors visibility into costs and performance by division.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the flavors and fragrances industry, a key competitive advantage is the "stickiness" of customer relationships. Products are often co-developed with customers and become integral to the end-product's formula, making it difficult and costly for customers to switch suppliers. IFF's long-standing relationships with major consumer packaged goods companies are a testament to this advantage. Furthermore, its vast portfolio of proprietary formulas and patents, combined with a global manufacturing and creative footprint, provides significant scale advantages that are difficult for smaller players to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm (Filed February 28, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current management team is heavily focused on a multi-year turnaround plan. This involves significant upfront costs related to restructuring and portfolio optimization (divestitures) that are impacting short-term GAAP profits. However, as articulated in the Q2 2025 earnings call, these actions are explicitly designed to improve the company's long-term growth trajectory, margin profile, and balance sheet health. This willingness to absorb near-term pain for long-term gain is a hallmark of a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, IFF had approximately $10.1 billion in long-term debt, with cash and cash equivalents of $645 million. The company's leverage has been a key focus for investors. However, IFF generates significant cash flow from operations and is using proceeds from its large divestitures to aggressively pay down debt. Management has repeatedly stated that debt reduction is a top capital allocation priority. Given these factors, the risk of needing dilutive equity financing for growth is low.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current management team has been direct in acknowledging the company's recent challenges, including volume declines, margin pressures, and the complexities of its turnaround. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, the CEO and CFO openly discussed areas of underperformance and the specific steps being taken to address them. They provided clear, detailed answers to analyst questions regarding the progress of their strategic initiatives. This represents a high degree of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IFF/transcripts/ (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 6, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's recent SEC filings, including the legal proceedings section of the 2024 10-K, reveals no major regulatory actions or legal settlements that would call the integrity of the senior management team into question. The company has a corporate governance framework and code of conduct in place. There are no significant related-party transactions or other red flags in its filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm (Filed February 28, 2025)]

---
Synthesis:
The analysis suggests IFF is a company with strong foundational assets but is in the midst of a significant turnaround. The strongest positives are its entrenched position in a stable industry, a clear commitment to long-term strategic improvement, and robust financial controls and investor transparency. The primary negatives stem from recent operational execution, evidenced by lagging profit margins and market share performance, which led to a "No" for its sales organization and current profitability. There has also been considerable executive turnover, creating instability. The Fisher score will most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on the success of the new management team's strategic plan. A sustained improvement in organic volume growth and a clear expansion in operating margins for several consecutive quarters would be the key evidence needed to flip the "No" answers on points 4 (Sales) and 5 (Margins) to "Yes".

fisher score is 11 / 15
