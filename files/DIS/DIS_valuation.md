I have now performed initial searches to locate the necessary primary documents.
- The latest earnings were for Q3 2025, reported on August 6, 2025.
- I have access to the earnings call transcript from this date.
- I can find SEC filings, including the latest 10-Q.

My next step is to gather the specific financial numbers needed for the valuation. I will use the provided URLs from the prompt, which are reputable sources for financial data, and cross-reference with the SEC filings information I've found.

I will proceed with gathering data for the "Baseline Financials (TTM)" section. I need to get the last four quarters of data to calculate the trailing twelve months figures. Based on the search results, the most recent quarter ended June 28, 2025. Therefore, I will need data for the quarters ending June 2025, March 2025, December 2024, and September 2024.I've found the Q3 2025 earnings call information. While a full transcript browse failed, the search results provide key quotes and summaries.

**B) Management Guidance Extraction:**

From the search results of the earnings call on August 6, 2025, I can extract the following key points:

*   **Streaming Strategy:** "Hulu will now become our global general entertainment brand, and in the fall, it will replace the Star tile on Disney+ internationally." This is a strategic shift, but doesn't provide a hard number for growth.
*   **ESPN DTC Launch:** "on August 21st, we will launch ESPN's direct to consumer offering." This is a major catalyst, but financial guidance is not provided in the snippets.
*   **Parks Expansion:** "we're building on our best-in-class parks and experiences businesses with more expansions underway around the world than at any other time in our history." This supports future growth but lacks specifics.
*   **No Guidance Update:** An analyst question regarding 2026 guidance was met with: "no no update on the guidance versus what we've talked about in in the past as I said we'll we'll talk about 26 guidance on the on the Q4 call but no update on DTC at this point."

**Conclusion on Guidance:** There is no explicit, forward-looking numerical guidance for company-wide revenue growth or overall margins in the provided snippets for the forecast period. The company states they will provide 2026 guidance on the Q4 call.

Given the lack of specific guidance, I will proceed with the valuation by using historical averages and management's qualitative commentary to form my assumptions, as instructed.

My next step is to gather the necessary data for the Discount Rate (WACC) and the Terminal Value multiples. This involves finding the risk-free rate, beta, and historical valuation multiples.I have successfully gathered the inputs for the WACC calculation.

*   **Risk-Free Rate:** The US 10-Year Treasury yield is approximately **4.30%** (August 20, 2025).
*   **Beta:** I have several sources for Beta. TradingView shows a 1-year beta of 0.92, while GuruFocus shows a 3-year beta of 1.58. Macroaxis gives 1.08. Given Disney is a large, established blue-chip company, a beta very close to the market average (1.0) is most reasonable. The higher beta from GuruFocus might reflect more recent volatility in the media sector. I will use a beta of **1.10**, slightly above the market, to reflect the ongoing transitions in its business model (streaming shift, ESPN DTC).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** The instructions suggest a range of 4.5% - 5.5%. Kroll (formerly Duff & Phelps) is a reputable source, and while their latest recommendation wasn't captured directly, historical changes show movements between 5.0% and 6.0%. A common standard is around 5.0%. I will use **5.0%**.
*   **Historical EV/EBITDA:** Finbox and GuruFocus provide historical data. The 5-year median from Finbox is **18.5x**, while the 13-year median from GuruFocus is **15.54x**. The current TTM multiple is around 12-13x. Using a median figure smooths out recent volatility. I will use the more conservative **15.5x** as the cross-check for the terminal value, as it is closer to the long-term median.

I now have all the necessary components to build the valuation model. I will proceed with the calculations and format the final response according to the user's detailed instructions. No further browsing is required. I will structure the final output clearly, showing all steps from A to H.

Final Answer Construction:

1.  **Header:** Fill in company details.
2.  **A) Baseline Financials:** Create the table using the data I've already extracted.
3.  **B) Guidance Extracts:** Summarize the qualitative points from the Q3 2025 call.
4.  **C) Forecast & Assumptions:**
    *   **Revenue:** I'll assume a growth rate based on historical performance and management commentary. Disney's TTM revenue growth is ~5%. Given the parks' strength and new streaming initiatives (ESPN DTC), a slight moderation from that seems reasonable as a base case, factoring in potential linear network declines. I'll use **4.5%** for Year 1, tapering to **3.5%** by Year 5.
    *   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 15.1%. I will assume a modest margin expansion towards the historical median, driven by cost-cutting and streaming profitability improvements. I'll project a path from **15.2%** to **16.0%** over 5 years.
    *   **Tax Rate:** The historical effective tax rates have been volatile. The FY 2023 rate was 28.9%, and FY 2024 was 23.7%. I will use a normalized rate of **23.0%**.
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex is $7.6B, or ~8.0% of revenue. This is high due to park investments. I'll model it as a percentage of revenue, starting at **7.5%** and decreasing slightly to **7.0%** as major projects complete.
    *   **D&A and SBC:** I will hold these as a stable percentage of revenue, based on the TTM figures. D&A is ~5.5% of revenue, and SBC is ~1.4%.
    *   **Working Capital:** Model as a % of incremental revenue. TTM Change in WC was $1,019M on revenue growth of ~$4.5B. I'll use ~22% of incremental revenue.
5.  **D) FCFF Build:** Construct the 5-year table using the assumptions above.
6.  **E) WACC Calculation:**
    *   Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 1.10 * 5.0% = **9.80%**
    *   Cost of Debt = $1,928M / $42,263M = **4.56%**. After-tax = 4.56% * (1 - 0.23) = **3.51%**
    *   Market Cap = Will need a current share price. Let's assume the price from the browse, ~$117. `117.04 * 1814M shares = $212,310M`.
    *   EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash = $212,310 + $42,263 - $5,367 = $249,206M
    *   WACC = ($212,310/$249,206)*9.80% + ($37,025/$249,206)*3.51% = **7.53%** (using market value of equity and net debt for weights)
    *   Correcting WACC calculation: WACC = (E/(E+D)) * CoE + (D/(E+D)) * CoD * (1-T). `E = $212,310M`, `D = $42,263M`. `E+D = $254,573M`.
    *   WACC = (212310/254573)*9.80% + (42263/254573)*4.56%*(1-0.23) = 8.16% + 0.58% = **8.74%**
7.  **F) Terminal Value:**
    *   Gordon Growth: `g = 2.5%`. TV = `FCFF_Y5 * (1.025) / (0.0874 - 0.025)`.
    *   Exit Multiple: Cross-check with `15.5x` EV/EBITDA.
8.  **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge:** Calculate PVs and derive Equity Value.
9.  **H) Per-Share Value and MOS:** Calculate final share price, a range, and the Margin of Safety price.
10. **Final Formatting:** Put it all together in the requested markdown structure.

I will now write out the final answer.## **Intrinsic Value Analysis: The Walt Disney Company (DIS)**

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$58.18**| **= Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $105,534M / 1,814M** |
| Low / Bear Case | ~$45 | Assumes lower revenue growth (2.0-3.0%), margin compression to 14.0% due to streaming competition and parks slowdown, resulting in lower FCFF. |
| High / Bull Case | ~$75 | Assumes higher revenue growth (5.5-6.5%) from successful ESPN DTC launch and strong Parks demand, with margin expansion to 17.5% through efficiency gains. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)**| **$40.73** | **= Base-Case \* (1 - 0.30)** |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Streaming Profitability:** The transition from linear networks to a direct-to-consumer streaming model carries significant execution risk. Achieving sustained profitability in the highly competitive streaming landscape is critical and not guaranteed.
2.  **Economic Sensitivity:** The Experiences segment (Parks, Resorts, Cruises) is Disney's largest profit driver and is highly sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and discretionary consumer spending. A global recession could significantly impact attendance and profitability.
3.  **Content Pipeline:** The success of the film studio is inherently volatile and dependent on the consistent creation of hit franchises. Underperformance of key movie releases can have cascading negative effects on consumer products and park attractions.
4.  **Cord-Cutting:** The decline of the traditional cable bundle continues to pressure the profitability of the valuable Linear Networks (like ESPN), and the transition to a DTC model may not fully offset this decline.

final answer is 58.18 $
