Church & Dwight Co., Inc., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Church & Dwight's strategy relies on its "Evergreen" model, targeting 3% organic sales growth and 8% EPS growth annually. The company's portfolio is concentrated in 14 "power brands" which represent over 85% of its sales and profits, a strategy outlined in its fiscal 2024 10-K filing. Recent performance supports this, with the Q2 2025 results showing a 4.9% increase in net sales, driven by growth in brands like ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent and BATISTE dry shampoo. Management's commentary on the August 1, 2025 earnings call highlighted a focus on expanding these power brands into adjacent categories and international markets, such as the THERABREATH brand. This focus on established, market-leading brands in non-discretionary consumer categories provides a clear path for sustained, albeit moderate, growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear commitment to bolt-on acquisitions and product innovation to supplement growth from its core brands. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Rick Dierker stated that new product innovation is a key driver of organic growth, contributing to the strong performance of brands like ARM & HAMMER Power Sheets. The company’s 2024 10-K describes its long-term strategy of acquiring number one or number two brands in high-growth categories, with THERABREATH cited as a successful recent example. This dual-pronged approach of internal innovation and strategic M&A shows a clear determination to expand sales potential beyond the maturation of existing product lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CHD/transcripts/Church-Dwight-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call/ (August 1, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Church & Dwight’s R&D spending is modest relative to its revenue, a common trait in the consumer packaged goods industry which often relies on marketing and brand equity. For the fiscal year 2024, the company's R&D expense was $82.7 million, representing approximately 1.4% of its $5.88 billion in net sales. This level of spending is consistent with prior years. The company describes its R&D activities as focused on product improvements and new product development, but it does not provide specific metrics on the success rate or return on this investment. While new products like Power Sheets are cited as successful, the evidence of overall R&D effectiveness compared to industry peers is not detailed in its public filings.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company achieves broad market penetration through a hybrid sales approach, utilizing both an internal sales force and a network of brokers and distributors. As disclosed in its 2024 10-K, Wal-Mart is a key customer, accounting for approximately 25% of net sales, indicating a strong relationship with the world's largest retailer. The company's consistent organic growth, which was 5.1% in fiscal 2024 and is projected to be 4% for fiscal 2025, suggests an effective sales and marketing function capable of driving volume and pricing. The ability to consistently place new products and execute on pricing strategies with major retailers points to an effective, if not explicitly detailed, sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025101235/chd-20250630.htm (August 1, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Church & Dwight consistently maintains strong profit margins. For the second quarter of 2025, the company reported a gross margin of 46.5%, an increase from 45.1% in the prior year period. For the full fiscal year 2024, gross margin was 45.4%. The company's operating profit margin for the first six months of 2025 was 18.9%. These margins are robust for the consumer staples sector and reflect the company's strong brand equity and pricing power.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025101235/chd-20250630.htm (August 1, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving gross margins through a combination of pricing, productivity improvements, and managing inflationary pressures. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, executives attributed the 140 basis point expansion in gross margin to favorable pricing and volume, which more than offset higher manufacturing costs. The company has a formal productivity program and is targeting a gross margin of 47% for the full year 2025. This demonstrates a clear and successful strategy to actively manage and enhance profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, approximately 16% of the company's U.S. workforce was represented by unions, with all collective bargaining agreements scheduled for renewal in 2025 now successfully renewed. The 2024 10-K states the company believes its employee relations are "good." However, beyond these standard disclosures, there is limited specific, verifiable evidence in its filings or transcripts regarding employee turnover, engagement scores, or other key metrics that would definitively prove "outstanding" relations. The absence of reported widespread labor disputes is a positive, but not sufficient, indicator.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Church & Dwight has demonstrated a stable and experienced leadership team. The 2024 10-K shows a team with significant tenure at the company. The recent CEO transition appeared orderly, with Matthew T. Farrell retiring and Rick Dierker, a long-time executive, being promoted to the role, suggesting a well-managed succession plan. Executive compensation appears aligned with performance, based on standard metrics like net sales and EPS growth. There are no reported signs of significant executive turnover or internal discord.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s public disclosures primarily focus on its named executive officers. The recent promotion of the former CFO, Rick Dierker, to CEO demonstrates a degree of bench strength at the highest level. However, the filings do not provide significant detail on the management team beyond the C-suite or highlight leaders of key divisions and functions. Without more information on the next layer of management and formal succession plans for roles beyond the CEO, it is difficult to definitively assess the depth of the entire management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Church & Dwight's financial reporting provides detailed segment information, breaking down net sales and income by its three divisions: Domestic Consumer, International Consumer, and Specialty Products. The company’s independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, and also on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. There is no recent history of financial restatements or material weaknesses identified, indicating that cost analysis and accounting controls are robust and reliable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025101235/chd-20250630.htm (August 1, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the consumer packaged goods industry is brand equity and market share concentration, and Church & Dwight excels here. The company's strategy of focusing on a portfolio of 14 "power brands" allows it to concentrate marketing and innovation spending to defend and grow its leading positions in niche categories like baking soda, clumping cat litter, and dry shampoo. This contrasts with larger, more diversified competitors and provides a significant competitive moat. Furthermore, their positioning as a "value" brand for many of their products, such as ARM & HAMMER laundry detergent, gives them a defensive posture in various economic climates.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy is explicitly long-term, embodied in their "Evergreen" business model which targets consistent 3% organic sales growth and 8% annual EPS growth. The company's approach to acquisitions—purchasing brands with long-term growth potential like THERABREATH—demonstrates a willingness to invest for future returns. While the company provides quarterly and annual guidance, the commentary on earnings calls consistently frames these short-term results within the context of achieving their long-range Evergreen targets, indicating a balanced but fundamentally long-term perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CHD/transcripts/Church-Dwight-Q2-2025-Earnings-Call/ (August 1, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow, mitigating the need for dilutive equity financing. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $275.5 million in cash on hand and generated $580.8 million in cash from operations in the first six months of the year. While the company does carry long-term debt, its leverage is managed, and it maintains access to a revolving credit facility for liquidity. The company's consistent cash flow is more than sufficient to fund capital expenditures, dividends, and bolt-on acquisitions without resorting to the equity markets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025101235/chd-20250630.htm (August 1, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a consistent and open dialogue with investors through regular earnings calls and presentations. On the Q2 2025 earnings call, executives directly addressed challenges, such as higher manufacturing costs and specific brand performance, providing detailed explanations and context. They openly discuss both positive and negative drivers of performance, such as acknowledging the impact of inflation on costs while also highlighting their successful pricing and productivity efforts. This transparent communication style, consistent over time, suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of Church & Dwight's recent SEC filings reveals no material legal proceedings, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would call management's integrity into question. The auditor has consistently provided unqualified opinions on the financial statements and internal controls. The company has a code of conduct that applies to all employees and directors, and there is no evidence of significant breaches. Based on public disclosures, the management team operates with a high standard of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/313927/000095017025019801/chd-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

**Synthesis**

Church & Dwight scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting a stable, well-managed business with strong brands and financials. The company's key strengths are its focus on market-leading "power brands" (Points 1, 11), consistent and worthwhile profit margins supported by active productivity programs (Points 5, 6), and a sound, long-term financial strategy that avoids shareholder dilution (Points 12, 13). However, the analysis reveals weaknesses in areas where public disclosure is limited, specifically regarding the detailed effectiveness of R&D spending (Point 3), quantitative proof of "outstanding" labor relations beyond standard statements (Point 7), and the visible depth of management below the executive team (Point 9). The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company were to provide more granular metrics on its innovation pipeline success or employee engagement. Conversely, a failure to successfully integrate a future large acquisition or a significant disruption in its relationship with a key retailer like Wal-Mart could negatively impact the assessment. To flip the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to disclose more specific KPIs, such as R&D return on investment, employee turnover rates, and more detail on its non-executive leadership bench and succession plans.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
