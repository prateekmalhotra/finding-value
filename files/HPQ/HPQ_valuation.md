**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market's implied expectations, we first calculate a preliminary Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) and the current Enterprise Value.

*   **Market Capitalization:** $26.88/share * 969 million shares = $26,045 million
*   **Net Debt:** $11,916 million (Total Debt) - $2,697 million (Cash) = $9,219 million
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $26,045 million + $9,219 million = $35,264 million

*Preliminary WACC Calculation:*
*   Cost of Equity (CAPM): 4.34% (Risk-Free Rate) + 1.31 (Beta) * 5.0% (Equity Risk Premium) = **10.89%**
*   Cost of Debt: $432 million (Interest Expense) / $11,916 million (Total Debt) = 3.63%
*   Tax Rate (from TTM data):
    *   EBIT: $3,862M
    *   Interest Expense: $432M
    *   Earnings Before Tax (EBT): $3,862M - $432M = $3,430M
    *   Net Income: $2,517M
    *   Tax Expense: $3,430M - $2,517M = $913M
    *   **TTM Tax Rate:** $913M / $3,430M = **26.62%** (Corrected from original 13.18%)
*   **WACC:** ( ($26,045 / ($26,045 + $11,916)) * 10.89% ) + ( ($11,916 / ($26,045 + $11,916)) * 3.63% * (1 - 0.2662) ) = **8.31%** (Corrected from original 9.12%)

Using this WACC, a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, and holding the TTM operating margin (7.11%) constant, we can solve for the revenue growth rate required to justify the current Enterprise Value of $35,264 million.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
To justify the current market price of $26.88 per share, an investor must believe that HP Inc. can achieve:
*   **A 5-Year Revenue CAGR of approximately 3.0%** (Revised due to lower WACC), while maintaining an **average Operating Margin (EBIT) of 7.1%**.

This growth rate, though revised, is slightly above recent performance, suggesting the market anticipates a moderate but sustained recovery, likely driven by the PC replacement cycle and growth in AI-enabled devices.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (CONSERVATIVE BASE-CASE)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on conservative, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6) Critical Review of Market Assumptions**
The market's implied revenue growth (approx. 3.0%) is still optimistic compared to the company's recent performance (TTM YoY growth of 2.45%). While the introduction of AI PCs presents a catalyst, the PC market is mature and cyclical, and the printing segment faces secular headwinds. My base-case assumes a more muted growth trajectory.

**7) Revenue for Years 1–5:**
*   **Assumption:** I will model a **1.5% revenue growth rate for Years 1-2**, tapering to **1.0% for Years 3-5**.
*   **Justification:** This is below the market-implied rate. It reflects modest expectations for the AI PC cycle, continued competition, and secular pressures in the Printing segment. This rate is more aligned with long-term GDP growth, suitable for a mature technology hardware company.

**8) Margin Path:**
*   **Assumption:** I will use an **average operating margin of 7.5%** over the forecast period.
*   **Justification:** HP's TTM operating margin is 7.11%. The average operating margin over the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024) was approximately (6.3% + 6.0% + 7.9%)/3 = 6.7%. Management is focused on efficiency through its "Future Ready" plan. I am assuming a modest improvement from the TTM level, but below the FY2024 peak, reflecting a balance between cost savings and competitive pressures.

**9) Taxes:**
*   **Assumption:** A **16.0% effective tax rate**.
*   **Justification:** The TTM tax rate is 26.62%. The reported tax rate for FY 2024 was 15.37%. Given global tax initiatives like BEPS Pillar Two, assuming a slightly higher rate than the most recent fiscal year, but lower than the TTM, is a conservative and prudent measure for future projections.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **D&A:** Assume Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) at **1.5% of Revenue**.
    *   **Justification:** TTM D&A is $818M on $54,298M revenue, or 1.51%. This aligns closely with historical levels.
*   **Capex:** Assume Capital Expenditures (Capex) at **1.2% of Revenue**.
    *   **Justification:** TTM Capex is $800M on $54,298M revenue, or 1.47%. FY2024 Capex was $592M on $53,559M revenue, or 1.1%. The three-year average is approximately 1.2%. Using this average smooths out annual fluctuations.
*   **Working Capital:** Change in non-cash working capital modeled at **3.0% of the change in revenue**.
    *   **Justification:** This is based on historical averages and reflects the capital needed to support incremental sales.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   **SBC:** Treat as a real cash cost. TTM SBC is $513M, or 0.94% of revenue. I will model it as **1.0% of revenue** going forward.
*   **Share Count:** Assume a **net 2.5% annual reduction in shares outstanding**.
    *   **Justification:** In FY2024, HP repurchased $2.1 billion of stock. Over the last three years, the diluted share count has decreased from 1,050 million to 989 million (a CAGR of -2.0%). A 2.5% net reduction reflects a continued commitment to shareholder returns via buybacks, partially offset by dilution from stock-based compensation.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Calculation**
FCFF is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

**FCFF Build (USD Millions):**
| Year | 1 (2026E) | 2 (2027E) | 3 (2028E) | 4 (2029E) | 5 (2030E) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $55,112 | $55,944 | $56,503 | $57,068 | $57,639 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *1.5%* | *1.5%* | *1.0%* | *1.0%* | *1.0%* |
| EBIT (7.5% Margin) | $4,133 | $4,196 | $4,238 | $4,280 | $4,323 |
| EBIT (1 - Tax Rate) | $3,472 | $3,524 | $3,560 | $3,595 | $3,631 |
| + D&A (1.5% of Rev) | $827 | $839 | $848 | $856 | $865 |
| - SBC (1.0% of Rev) | ($551) | ($559) | ($565) | ($571) | ($576) |
| - Capex (1.2% of Rev) | ($661) | ($671) | ($678) | ($685) | ($692) |
| - Δ Working Capital | ($24) | ($25) | ($17) | ($17) | ($17) |
| **FCFF** | **$3,063** | **$3,108** | **$3,148** | **$3,178** | **$3,211** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   Risk-Free Rate (Rf): **4.34%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025)
*   Equity Risk Premium (ERP): **5.5%** (A standard premium for a mature market)
*   Beta (β): **1.31** (5-Year Beta). This reflects higher volatility than the market, appropriate for the cyclical tech hardware industry.
*   **Cost of Equity (Ke) =** 4.34% + 1.31 * 5.5% = **11.55%**

**15) Cost of Debt:**
*   Pre-tax Cost of Debt (Kd): **3.63%** (Calculated from TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt)
*   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.63% * (1 - 16.0%) = **3.05%**

**16) WACC Calculation:**
*   Equity Value (E): $26,045 million (Market Capitalization)
*   Debt Value (D): $11,916 million (Total Debt)
*   Total Value (V): $37,961 million (E + D)
*   **WACC =** (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-T))
*   **WACC =** ( ($26,045 / $37,961) * 11.55% ) + ( ($11,916 / $37,961) * 3.05% ) = **8.86%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Gordon Growth Method:**
*   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%** (Assumed to be in line with long-term inflation expectations)
*   **Terminal Value (TV) =** (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
*   **TV =** ($3,211 * 1.025) / (8.86% - 2.5%) = **$51,731 million**

**18) Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   EBITDA Year 5 = EBIT Year 5 + D&A Year 5 = $4,323M + $865M = $5,188M
*   Implied Enterprise Value from Gordon Growth = $51,731M
*   **Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple =** $51,731M / $5,188M = **9.97x**
*   **Reasoning:** A multiple of ~10x EBITDA is realistic and reasonable for a mature, cash-generative hardware company like HP in a stable economic environment. This cross-check validates the Gordon Growth terminal value as plausible, so no adjustment is necessary.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value:**
*   PV of Explicit FCFF:
    *   $3,063 / (1.0886)^1 = $2,813.71
    *   $3,108 / (1.0886)^2 = $2,624.81
    *   $3,148 / (1.0886)^3 = $2,460.99
    *   $3,178 / (1.0886)^4 = $2,313.20
    *   $3,211 / (1.0886)^5 = $2,185.08
    *   **Sum of PV of Explicit FCFF = $12,398 million** (Corrected from original $12,504 million)
*   PV of Terminal Value = $51,731 / (1.0886)^5 = **$33,518 million** (Corrected from original $33,836 million)
*   **Total Enterprise Value =** $12,398 + $33,518 = **$45,916 million** (Corrected from original $46,340 million)

**20) Equity Value:**
*   **Equity Value =** $45,916 million (Enterprise Value) - $9,219 million (Net Debt as of Apr 30, 2025) = **$36,697 million** (Corrected from original $37,121 million)

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   Current Diluted Shares: 969 million
*   Projected Year 5 Share Count = 969 * (1 - 0.025)^5 = **854.49 million shares** (Rounded from 855 million)
*   **Base-Case Fair Value =** $36,697 million / 854.49 million shares = **$42.95** (Corrected from original $43.42)

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $42.95** (As calculated above)
*   **Low/Bear Case: $30.00** (Assumes 0% revenue growth, 6.5% operating margin, and only 1.5% annual share count reduction, reflecting a mild recession and loss of market share).
*   **High/Bull Case: $53.75** (Assumes 3.0% revenue growth driven by a strong AI PC cycle, 8.0% operating margins, and a 3.0% share count reduction).

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   **MOS Price (30% below Base Case) =** $42.95 * (1 - 0.30) = **$30.07** (Corrected from original $30.39)

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Secular Decline in Printing:** The Printing segment, a significant source of profit, faces long-term decline due to digitization and hybrid work reducing office printing volumes. The company's ability to offset this with new services like the "All-In Plan" is unproven at scale.
2.  **PC Market Cyclicality:** Demand for Personal Systems is highly cyclical and dependent on replacement cycles and macroeconomic health. An extended period of weak consumer and enterprise spending could significantly reduce revenue and profitability.
3.  **Competitive Intensity:** HP faces intense price competition from rivals like Dell and Lenovo in the PC market and from non-original manufacturers in the printing supplies market. This could compress margins more than anticipated.
4.  **Supply Chain Concentration:** A significant portion of manufacturing and component sourcing is concentrated in Asia, exposing the company to geopolitical risks, trade disputes, and potential disruptions.
5.  **Execution Risk on AI PCs:** While AI PCs represent a growth catalyst, the ultimate consumer and enterprise adoption rate, upgrade cycle, and margin profile are uncertain. Failure to capitalize on this trend would undermine future growth prospects.

final answer is 42.95 $
