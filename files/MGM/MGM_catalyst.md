### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a history of aggressive share buybacks and in April 2025, the Board of Directors authorized a new $2 billion share repurchase program. This is in addition to the remaining availability under the November 2023 stock repurchase plan.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** The repurchase program is ongoing.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $1 billion worth of shares at an average price of $45 per share, reducing the share count by approximately 22.2 million shares.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $2 billion worth of shares at an average price of $45 per share, reducing the share count by approximately 44.4 million shares.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company fully utilizes the new $2 billion authorization and any remaining from the previous authorization at an average price of $45 per share, reducing the share count by over 50 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (5-15%). The reduction in share count will be accretive to EPS, and the market should react positively to the continued return of capital to shareholders.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a strong track record of completing its repurchase authorizations.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price remaining at levels management deems attractive for buybacks.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on the number of shares repurchased (Form 10-Q, 10-K).
    *   Announcements of new or expanded repurchase authorizations.
    *   Daily trading volume of MGM stock.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant run-up in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   A major economic downturn could force the company to preserve cash.
    *   The company could choose to prioritize debt repayment or acquisitions over buybacks.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The aggressive share repurchase program provides a strong tailwind for the stock.

**2. Catalyst Title:** BetMGM Profitability and Growth
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The BetMGM joint venture is expected to be a significant contributor to MGM's earnings growth. BetMGM North America raised its full-year 2025 guidance to at least $2.7 billion in net revenue.
*   **Mechanism:** As BetMGM's revenue and profitability grow, it will contribute more to MGM's bottom line and increase the market's valuation of this segment.
*   **Timing:** Full-year 2025 results will be reported in early 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** BetMGM achieves the low end of its revenue guidance and its contribution to MGM's net income is minimal.
    *   **Base Scenario:** BetMGM achieves its revenue guidance of $2.7 billion and contributes positively to MGM's net income.
    *   **High Scenario:** BetMGM exceeds its revenue guidance and shows strong margin expansion, leading to a significant contribution to MGM's net income.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%). The market is looking for continued growth and a clear path to profitability for BetMGM.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has raised guidance and management has expressed confidence in the venture's trajectory.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued growth in the online sports betting and iGaming markets.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly earnings reports from MGM and Entain.
    *   State-level gaming revenue reports.
    *   Announcements of new state launches for BetMGM.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Increased competition in the online gaming space.
    *   A slowdown in the legalization of online gaming in new states.
    *   Regulatory changes that could negatively impact the industry.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The market appears to be undervaluing the long-term potential of BetMGM.

**1. Catalyst Title:** New York Full Commercial Gaming License
*   **Type:** Regulatory
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** MGM is actively pursuing one of the three downstate commercial gaming licenses in New York. A successful bid would allow the company to convert its Empire City property into a full-scale casino.
*   **Mechanism:** A full-scale casino in the New York City area would be a massive revenue and earnings driver for the company, given the population density and wealth of the region.
*   **Timing:** 12-24 months for the licensing decision.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** MGM fails to win a license.
    *   **Base Scenario:** MGM wins a license and develops a casino that generates an incremental $500 million in annual EBITDA.
    *   **High Scenario:** MGM wins a license and the new casino becomes one of the highest-grossing in the country, generating over $1 billion in annual EBITDA.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). This is a transformative catalyst for the company.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The competition for the licenses will be intense, but MGM is a strong contender.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** A favorable decision from the New York State Gaming Commission.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Announcements from the New York State Gaming Commission.
    *   News reports on the bidding process.

*   **Timing:** The resort is expected to open in the early 2030s.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The project is delayed or faces significant cost overruns.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The resort opens on time and on budget, and generates an annual EBITDA contribution to MGM of $500 million.
    *   **High Scenario:** The resort is a huge success and becomes a major driver of MGM's international growth, with an annual EBITDA contribution of over $1 billion.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). The Japanese market is a massive opportunity for MGM.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The project has received government approval, but there are still execution risks.

*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly updates on the construction progress and budget.

### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. BetMGM Valuation:**

*   **Base Case:** If BetMGM achieves $2.7 billion in revenue and a 15% EBITDA margin, its EBITDA would be $405 million. At a 10x multiple, the enterprise value would be $4.05 billion. MGM's 50% share would be worth over $2 billion.
*   **High Case:** If BetMGM achieves $3.5 billion in revenue and a 20% EBITDA margin, its EBITDA would be $700 million. At a 12x multiple, the enterprise value would be $8.4 billion. MGM's 50% share would be worth over $4.2 billion.

**2. New York License:**

*   **Base Case:** An incremental $500 million in annual EBITDA at an 8x multiple would create $4 billion in value.
*   **High Case:** An incremental $1 billion in annual EBITDA at a 10x multiple would create $10 billion in value.

### **Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for MGM are overwhelmingly positive. The aggressive share repurchase program provides a strong floor for the stock, while the continued growth and improving profitability of BetMGM offer significant upside. The market appears to be undervaluing the long-term potential of the company's development pipeline, particularly the New York and Japan opportunities. The short-term market signal is bullish, with multiple avenues for value creation in the next 0-12 months.

2.  **A major regulatory shift:** A change in the legal landscape for gaming in the U.S., China, or Japan could derail the company's growth plans.
3.  **A catastrophic event at a major property:** A natural disaster or terrorist attack at one of MGM's flagship properties would have a devastating impact on the company's financials and reputation.

### **Final Recommendation Paragraph**

MGM Resorts International presents a compelling investment case with a strong balance of near-term and long-term catalysts. The aggressive share repurchase program provides immediate support for the stock, while the continued growth of BetMGM offers significant upside in the coming year. The long-term potential of the New York and Japan development projects is a game-changer for the company. The most important indicator to monitor in the near term is the quarterly performance of BetMGM, as this will be a key driver of the stock in the next 12 months.
