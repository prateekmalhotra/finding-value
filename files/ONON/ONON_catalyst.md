### Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)

**1. Continued "Beat and Raise" Quarters Driven by DTC and APAC Growth**

*   **Catalyst Title:** Continued "Beat and Raise" Quarters Driven by Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) and Asia-Pacific (APAC) Growth.
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On has a track record of exceeding financial expectations. Continued strong momentum in the high-margin DTC channel and rapid growth in the APAC region, particularly China, could lead to further upward revisions of full-year guidance. In Q2 2025, DTC net sales grew 54.3% year-over-year at constant currency, and APAC net sales grew 110.9% year-over-year at constant currency.
*   **Mechanism:** Consistently exceeding analyst expectations and raising guidance would increase investor confidence in the company's growth trajectory and profitability, leading to a higher valuation multiple on the stock.
*   **Timing:** Next quarterly earnings announcements (Q3 2025, Q4 2025, Q1 2026, Q2 2026).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low:** 2-3% quarterly revenue beat.
    *   **Base:** 4-6% quarterly revenue beat, with a small increase in full-year guidance.
    *   **High:** >7% quarterly revenue beat, with a significant increase in full-year guidance, driving the stock price higher.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has a strong history of exceeding expectations, and the growth drivers in DTC and APAC appear robust.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Sustained consumer demand in key markets, effective marketing and brand building, and successful execution of retail expansion plans in China.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly revenue growth rate (vs. guidance and consensus).
    *   DTC channel growth rate and percentage of total sales.
    *   APAC and Greater China sales growth.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Slowing consumer spending due to macroeconomic headwinds.
    *   Increased competition from established players.
    *   Execution risks in new market expansion.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

**2. Sustained Gross Margin Expansion Above 60%**

*   **Catalyst Title:** Sustained Gross Margin Expansion Above 60%.
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On has demonstrated strong pricing power and the ability to expand gross margins, reaching 61.5% in Q2 2025. The company's focus on the premium segment and growing DTC channel, which has higher margins, are key drivers.
*   **Mechanism:** Higher gross margins lead directly to higher profitability (net income) and improved cash flow, which are key valuation drivers. Sustaining margins above 60% would demonstrate the brand's pricing power and operational efficiency.
*   **Timing:** 0–12 months
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low:** Gross margin maintained in the 60-60.5% range.
    *   **Base:** Gross margin consistently in the 60.5-61.5% range.
    *   **High:** Gross margin exceeding 62%, leading to significant earnings beats.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-15%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has raised its full-year 2025 gross margin guidance to 60.5-61.0%, indicating confidence in maintaining these levels.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Favorable supply chain costs, continued brand desirability allowing for premium pricing, and a growing share of DTC sales.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly gross profit margin.
    *   Input cost trends (materials, labor, freight).
    *   DTC vs. wholesale channel mix.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Increased promotional activity to drive sales.
    *   Negative impact of tariffs and duties.
    *   Unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

### Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)

*   **Catalyst Title:** Successful Expansion into New Product Categories, Primarily Apparel.
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On is actively expanding its apparel offerings, which grew at 75.5% at constant exchange rates in Q2 2025. A successful expansion into a full range of performance and lifestyle apparel could significantly increase the company's total addressable market and revenue potential.
*   **Mechanism:** Apparel is a larger market than performance footwear. By establishing a credible and desirable apparel line, On can increase its share of the customer's wallet, drive higher average order values, and create a more holistic brand image, leading to a significant re-rating of the stock.
*   **Timing:** 12–24 months
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low:** Apparel sales grow to 10% of total revenue in the next 3 years.
    *   **Base:** Apparel sales reach 15-20% of total revenue in the next 3-5 years.
    *   **High:** Apparel becomes a major growth engine, reaching over 25% of revenue and driving overall growth rates higher than currently anticipated.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 65%. The initial growth in apparel is promising, but building a large, profitable apparel business is challenging and competitive.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Innovative and well-received product designs, effective marketing for apparel, and building a supply chain capable of supporting a large apparel business.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Apparel sales growth rate.
    *   Apparel as a percentage of total revenue.
    *   Gross margin of the apparel segment.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Failure to create compelling apparel products that resonate with consumers.
    *   Intense competition from established apparel giants.

### Valuation Sensitivity Examples

**1. Continued "Beat and Raise" Quarters**

*   **Scenario:** On beats its raised 2025 revenue guidance of CHF 2.91 billion by 5%, reaching CHF 3.055 billion.
*   **Valuation Impact:** Assuming a constant Price/Sales multiple, this could lead to a 5% increase in the share price. If the beat and raise leads to multiple expansion, the impact could be larger.

**2. Sustained Gross Margin Expansion**

*   **Scenario:** On achieves a full-year 2025 gross margin of 61.5%, exceeding the high end of its guidance. On a guided revenue of CHF 2.91 billion, this would result in an additional CHF 14.55 million in gross profit compared to a 61% margin.
*   **Valuation Impact:** This additional profit could flow down to the bottom line, increasing EPS and potentially justifying a higher Price/Earnings multiple.

### Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal

The near-term catalysts for On Holding appear to be net positive. The company's strong growth momentum, particularly in the high-margin DTC channel and the rapidly expanding APAC region, provides a clear path to continued financial outperformance. The ability to maintain and even expand gross margins in the face of inflationary pressures is a strong signal of the brand's pricing power. While the stock's valuation is high, continued execution and "beat and raise" quarters can justify and even expand the current multiple.

### Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts

1.  **Significant Slowdown in Consumer Demand:** A global recession or a sharp downturn in consumer spending on discretionary goods could significantly impact On's growth trajectory, regardless of brand momentum.
2.  **Fashion/Trend Shift:** The athletic apparel and footwear market is subject to changing fashion trends. A shift in consumer preferences away from the "athleisure" trend or On's specific design aesthetic could quickly erode demand.
3.  **Major Supply Chain Disruption:** On relies on third-party manufacturers, primarily in Vietnam and Indonesia. Any major disruption to its supply chain, whether due to geopolitical events, natural disasters, or trade disputes, could severely impact its ability to meet demand and would likely lead to increased costs.

### Final Recommendation Paragraph

Based on the analysis of On Holding's primary financial disclosures and management commentary, the company presents a compelling growth story with several near- and long-term catalysts. The most significant near-term catalyst is the company's potential to continue its "beat and raise" performance, driven by strong growth in its direct-to-consumer and Asia-Pacific segments. A conservative estimate of the potential upside from this and other near-term catalysts is in the 10-20% range over the next 12 months. The single most important indicator to monitor will be the company's ability to sustain its high revenue growth rate and gross margins in its upcoming quarterly reports.
