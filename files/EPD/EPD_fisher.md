Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD), August 27, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and earnings call transcripts from 2023-2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (EPD) is a key provider of midstream energy services, linking major U.S. supply basins to domestic and international markets for natural gas, NGLs, crude oil, and petrochemicals. The company's growth is supported by increasing global demand for these products, particularly from developing nations. EPD is actively expanding its capacity to meet this demand, with several major projects underway, including new natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin, the Bahia NGL Pipeline, and an expansion of its LPG export capabilities at the Enterprise Hydrocarbons Terminal (EHT). These projects are backed by long-term, fee-based contracts, indicating sustained demand for EPD's services.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a strong commitment to growth through significant capital investments in new infrastructure. For 2025, the company has budgeted $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion for growth capital projects. Key projects include the construction of three new natural gas processing trains in the Permian Basin, the 550-mile Bahia NGL Pipeline, and a new ethane/propane export facility on the Neches River. These investments are strategically focused on high-growth areas like the Permian Basin and expanding export capabilities to meet rising international demand, showcasing a clear strategy for long-term development beyond existing asset maturation.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a midstream energy company, EPD does not engage in traditional research and development in the same way a technology or pharmaceutical company would. Its focus is on process optimization, engineering advancements, and developing new infrastructure projects. The company's filings do not disclose specific R&D expenditures. While EPD is effective at engineering and constructing new assets, there is no verifiable evidence of a formal R&D program or related metrics to evaluate its effectiveness against peers or its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the midstream sector, an effective "sales" organization excels at securing long-term, fee-based contracts to ensure high asset utilization. EPD has consistently demonstrated this ability, with its major growth projects being underwritten by long-term, fee-based contracts that often include minimum volume commitments. For example, the new natural gas processing trains in the Midland and Delaware Basins are supported by long-term acreage dedication agreements. This disciplined, demand-driven approach to expansion indicates a highly effective commercial and business development organization that secures revenue and mitigates risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EPD maintains strong and consistent profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross operating margin of $10.0 billion on revenues of $56.2 billion. The company's business model, which is predominantly fee-based, insulates it from the full volatility of commodity prices, leading to more stable margins. High utilization rates across its key segments, such as NGL fractionation (106.4% in 2024), demonstrate the efficiency and profitability of its asset base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EPD focuses on several strategies to maintain and improve margins. The company pursues operational efficiencies and cost control measures, as discussed in its earnings calls. A primary driver of margin improvement is the expansion into high-demand, high-margin businesses, such as petrochemicals (PDH facilities) and expanding LPG export capacity, where fee-based revenues are strong. Furthermore, by constructing new, more efficient assets and integrating them into its existing network, EPD creates synergistic cost savings and enhances the profitability of its entire value chain.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EPD has no direct employees; its functions are performed by approximately 7,800 personnel from EPCO. The company emphasizes a strong safety culture, reporting a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.33 for 2024, which it states compares favorably to the industry average. The 10-K report highlights a culture of "ownership, integrity, and opportunity" and a commitment to a safe and inclusive workforce. There is no mention in recent filings or reputable news sources of significant labor disputes, strikes, or widespread employee dissatisfaction.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EPD's management team exhibits stability and significant insider alignment. The executive team, including the Co-CEOs, has extensive tenure with the company and deep industry experience. As of December 31, 2024, insiders, primarily through EPCO and affiliates, owned approximately 32.4% of the Partnership's outstanding common units. This substantial ownership aligns the interests of management and the founding family with those of public unitholders. The existence of the "Office of the Chairman" structure, involving the Chairman, Vice Chairman, and both Co-CEOs, suggests a collaborative and stable approach to top-level management.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses a deep bench of executive talent beyond the Co-CEOs. The 10-K lists key operational leaders such as a Chief Operating Officer, Chief Commercial Officer, and Chief Financial Officer, each with decades of experience within the company and the industry. The clear delineation of responsibilities among the Co-CEOs and the broader executive team for areas like operations, commercial activities, and finance points to a well-structured and deep management team capable of handling the complexity of the business and ensuring succession.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EPD's financial reporting provides detailed segment information, allowing for a clear analysis of performance across its four main business lines. The company's 2024 Form 10-K includes an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, on both the financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. There is no history of major restatements or disclosures of material weaknesses in internal controls, indicating robust accounting and control systems.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EPD's key competitive advantage is the scale and integration of its asset network, particularly its concentration along the U.S. Gulf Coast. The Mont Belvieu complex, a massive NGL fractionation and storage hub, is a strategic chokepoint in the NGL value chain, giving EPD significant pricing power and operational leverage. This integration allows the company to capture value across multiple stages—from gathering and processing to transportation, fractionation, storage, and export. The company's extensive export terminal capacity for NGLs, ethane, and petrochemicals is another critical differentiator, positioning it to capitalize on the structural advantage of low-cost U.S. feedstock in global markets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently prioritizes long-term, durable growth over short-term results. This is evidenced by their disciplined capital allocation strategy, which involves self-funding the equity portion of growth projects through retained cash flow, thereby reducing reliance on volatile equity markets. The company has maintained a distribution coverage ratio of 1.7x for 2024, retaining $3.2 billion in distributable cash flow to reinvest in the business. This conservative financial policy, coupled with a multi-year pipeline of large-scale capital projects, demonstrates a clear focus on building long-term value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EPD's financial strategy is explicitly designed to avoid dilutive equity financing. The company funds its growth capital expenditures with retained distributable cash flow and debt, and has not issued public equity for this purpose in recent years. As of December 31, 2024, the company had $4.8 billion of liquidity, including available credit and cash on hand. The company also has a $2.0 billion unit buyback program in place, further signaling its commitment to returning capital and avoiding dilution. This self-funding model is a core component of their financial strength.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1061219/000106121925000006/form10k.htm (February 28, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a consistent and transparent communication style with investors through quarterly earnings calls and investor presentations. A review of transcripts from 2023 through 2025 shows management addressing operational challenges, market headwinds (such as petrochemical oversupply), and the rationale behind capital project timelines and decisions. They provide detailed operational metrics and are forthright in Q&A sessions with analysts, discussing both risks and opportunities without evasiveness.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://discountingcashflows.com/company/EPD/transcripts/ (2023-2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal or regulatory actions cited in recent SEC filings that would suggest a lack of integrity at the executive level. The company has a formal Code of Conduct, and related-party transactions with EPCO and its affiliates are disclosed and reviewed by the Audit and Conflicts Committee. The long tenure of the management team and the significant insider ownership by the founding family provide a strong incentive for maintaining a reputation of high integrity. A search of reputable news sources reveals no major scandals or governance controversies involving the current executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Enterprise Products Partners scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its status as a premier, blue-chip midstream operator. The company's strengths lie in its strategically integrated asset base with a long runway for growth, a disciplined and long-term oriented management team, and a fortress-like financial position that obviates the need for dilutive equity financing. The only negative score relates to R&D, which is not a primary focus for this type of business. The score is most likely to be impacted over the next 12–24 months by the successful execution of its large-scale capital projects, particularly the Bahia NGL pipeline and the Neches River export facility. Evidence that would flip the "No" on R&D to a "Yes" would require EPD to begin disclosing specific investments in technology or process innovation (e.g., carbon capture, advanced automation) and reporting metrics on their financial impact, which is unlikely given its current business model.

fisher score is 14 / 15
