**Synthesis:**
American Express scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong brand, loyal customer base, and effective management team. The company's key strengths lie in its differentiated business model, which provides a long runway for growth and supports high-profit margins. The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to continue to innovate and refresh its product offerings to attract and retain customers, and the impact of a potential economic downturn on its premium customer base. Evidence of a significant slowdown in new card acquisitions or a decline in spending from its existing customers would be the most likely factors to flip a "Yes" to a "No".

fisher score is 15 / 15
