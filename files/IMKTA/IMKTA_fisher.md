Company, August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Ingles Markets, Inc. FY24 10-K (filed December 27, 2024)

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles Markets operates in the highly competitive and mature U.S. supermarket industry. While the company has a solid regional presence in the southeastern United States, its growth is largely tied to population and economic growth in its existing footprint, as well as modest store count expansion and remodels. The company's ongoing strategy includes modernizing its store base and adding high-growth services like pharmacies and fuel centers. However, the industry is characterized by intense competition and narrow profit margins, which limits the potential for a "sizable" increase in sales beyond market growth rates.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles has a demonstrated commitment to reinvesting in its business to drive sales. This is evident through its capital expenditure program, which focuses on constructing new stores, remodeling existing ones, and adding services like fuel centers and pharmacies. In fiscal year 2024, capital expenditures totaled $210.9 million, a significant increase from $173.6 million in fiscal 2023. The company also continues to expand its private label offerings and has introduced online ordering for in-store pickup ("Ingles Curbside") at 134 of its stores, indicating an adaptation to changing consumer preferences.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a supermarket retailer, Ingles does not have a formal R&D department in the traditional sense. Its innovation is focused on merchandising strategies, store formats, and adapting to consumer trends. The company's development of private label brands like "Laura Lynn" and "Harvest Farms," as well as its investment in the Ingles Curbside online ordering platform, can be considered proxies for R&D. However, the 10-K does not provide specific metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of these initiatives relative to their cost or in comparison to peers.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles' sales efforts are centered on in-store customer experience, targeted promotions through its "Ingles Advantage Card" loyalty program, and traditional and digital advertising. The company aims to build customer loyalty through a combination of service, convenience, and competitive pricing. However, the provided filings do not contain specific metrics like customer retention rates, market share gains, or sales productivity data that would be necessary to definitively assess its sales organization as "above-average" compared to its numerous competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended September 28, 2024, Ingles reported a gross margin of 23.0% and an operating margin of 2.6%. These margins are generally in line with the notoriously thin margins of the supermarket industry. For comparison, in the prior fiscal year, the company's gross margin was 23.8% and its operating margin was 5.0%. The decline in profitability in fiscal 2024 was significantly impacted by inventory and asset impairment losses from Hurricane Helene. While the margins are not high in an absolute sense, they are characteristic of the industry.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles employs several strategies to manage its profit margins. These include the promotion of higher-margin private label products, such as its "Laura Lynn" and "Harvest Farms" brands, and the operation of a vertically integrated milk processing and packaging plant, which supplies its stores and sells to third parties. The company also focuses on efficiently managing its supply chain through its centralized warehouse and distribution facilities. Additionally, the growth of its fuel and pharmacy businesses provides alternative revenue streams that can contribute to overall profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of September 28, 2024, Ingles had approximately 26,360 associates, with about 58% of supermarket personnel working part-time. The company's 2024 10-K states that "Management considers labor relations to be good". However, it also notes that competition for labor has become more intense, leading to higher costs to attract and retain employees. There is no mention of union representation or significant labor disputes. While the company's assessment is positive, there is a lack of independent, verifiable data to confirm "outstanding" relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles is a "controlled company" with significant insider ownership. As of September 28, 2024, Chairman Robert P. Ingle II beneficially owned approximately 72.5% of the combined voting power of the company's stock. This level of control suggests a stable and aligned management team, but it also presents corporate governance risks, as the company is exempt from certain NASDAQ requirements, such as having a majority of independent directors. The concentration of power in a single individual, while ensuring stability, may not be viewed as "outstanding" from a broader governance perspective.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings list executive officers beyond the CEO, but they do not provide detailed information about succession planning or the depth of management below the executive level. The significant control exercised by the Ingle family, particularly the Chairman, raises potential "key person" risk. The 10-K does not offer sufficient detail to confidently assess the depth and breadth of the management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 28, 2024. Management's own assessment also concluded that internal controls were effective. There is no history of significant restatements or accounting scandals mentioned in the filing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator for Ingles in the supermarket industry is its extensive real estate ownership. As of September 28, 2024, the company owned 175 of its 198 supermarkets, as well as 101 shopping centers and 29 undeveloped sites. This real estate portfolio provides significant financial flexibility, reduces occupancy costs, and represents a substantial store of value not always reflected in the company's operating results. This is a distinct advantage over competitors who primarily lease their locations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent and substantial capital expenditure program, which totaled $210.9 million in fiscal 2024, demonstrates a focus on long-term growth and modernization over short-term profit maximization. Ingles' strategy of owning its real estate is inherently a long-term strategy. The willingness to invest heavily in new stores, remodels, and technology, even at the expense of near-term earnings, suggests a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles has a strong history of funding its capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and debt, rather than equity issuance. The company generated $262.5 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2024 and has consistently paid a dividend for 40 fiscal years. As of September 28, 2024, the company had no borrowings outstanding under its $150 million line of credit. Given its strong cash flow and access to debt markets, the risk of shareholder dilution from equity financing appears low.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ingles does not regularly host earnings conference calls, which limits the opportunities for investors to directly engage with and question management. The provided transcript link shows the most recent transcript is from 2016. While the company's SEC filings provide the required disclosures, including a detailed account of the negative impact of Hurricane Helene in the 2024 10-K, the lack of regular, open forums with investors is a significant drawback in assessing management's candor.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024), https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IMKTA/transcripts/

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K does not disclose any material legal proceedings that would be expected to have a significant impact on the business, nor does it mention any significant related-party transactions outside the ordinary course of business. The company has a code of ethics for its senior financial officers. However, the "controlled company" status and the resulting exemption from certain corporate governance standards, such as a majority-independent board, could be viewed as a negative from a governance perspective. There are no overt signs of a lack of integrity, but the governance structure is not ideal.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/50493/000005049324000018/imkt-20240928x10k.htm (December 27, 2024)

**Synthesis:**
Ingles Markets presents a mixed profile based on Fisher's 15 points. The company's strongest attributes are its significant real estate ownership, which provides a key competitive advantage and financial stability, and its consistent reinvestment in its store base, indicating a long-term outlook. Its financial position is solid, with strong operating cash flow and a low risk of equity dilution. However, the company scores poorly on points related to management and communication, largely due to its status as a "controlled company" with limited investor access and transparency. A key variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months would be a shift in its communication strategy, such as the initiation of regular earnings calls. Additionally, a clear articulation of a succession plan would mitigate concerns about key-person risk and could turn the "No" on management depth to a "Yes."

fisher score is 6 / 15
