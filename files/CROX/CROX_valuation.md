---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** A -7.0% decline is projected. This is based on H1 2025 actuals blended with the midpoint of Q3 guidance (-10%) and a similar rate assumed for Q4, reflecting management's cautious tone on the U.S. consumer and wholesale channel resets.
    *   **Years 2-5:** Growth is projected to rebound to 4.0% in Year 2 and stabilize at 3.0% annually thereafter. This reflects modest long-term growth driven by international expansion and sandals, offset by the maturity of the core clog product in North America.

*   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin):**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** The operating margin is forecast to be 21.3%, blending the stronger first half with the guided ~18.5% margin for the second half.
    *   **Years 2-5:** The margin is held stable at 22.0%. This is below the TTM margin of 24.3% to reflect ongoing tariff pressures and a more competitive promotional environment, assuming management cannot fully recapture peak profitability.

*   **Tax Rate:** A normalized effective tax rate of **21.0%** is used throughout the forecast period. This is based on the historical effective tax rates, excluding periods with significant one-off items, and is a conservative adjustment from the Q2 non-GAAP rate of 17.7%.

*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled at **2.0% of revenue**, slightly above the TTM level of 1.7% to account for continued investment in international growth and distribution infrastructure.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled at **3.0% of the change in revenue**, reflecting historical operational efficiency.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD, millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,849 | $4,003 | $4,123 | $4,247 | $4,374 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *-7.0%* | *4.0%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* |
| EBIT | $819 | $881 | $907 | $934 | $962 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *21.3%* | *22.0%* | *22.0%* | *22.0%* | *22.0%* |
| Tax on EBIT | ($172) | ($185) | ($190) | ($196) | ($202) |
| **NOPAT** | **$647** | **$696** | **$717** | **$738** | **$760** |
| D&A | $77 | $80 | $82 | $85 | $87 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($35) | ($36) | ($37) | ($38) | ($39) |
| Capital Expenditures | ($77) | ($80) | ($82) | ($85) | ($87) |
| Change in NWC | $9 | ($5) | ($4) | ($4) | ($4) |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **$621** | **$655** | **$676** | **$696** | **$715** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.29%** (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard market assumption)
    *   Beta: **1.41** (Source: Finviz, August 20, 2025). This reflects higher volatility than the market, consistent with a consumer discretionary brand.
    *   *Calculation: 4.29% + 1.41 * 5.0% = **11.34%***

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt`
    *   *Calculation: $94.8M / $1,774.0M = **5.34%***
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt: `5.34% * (1 - 21.0%) = **4.22%**`

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * After-Tax Cost of Debt`
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): **$4,550M** (Source: CompaniesMarketCap, August 20, 2025)
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): **$1,774M**
    *   *Calculation: ($4,550 / $6,324) * 11.34% + ($1,774 / $6,324) * 4.22% = **9.34%***

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This rate is chosen as a proxy for long-term global inflation and economic growth, a conservative cap for a mature company.
    *   *Calculation: ($715 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0934 - 0.025) = **$10,708M***

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $962M + $87M = **$1,049M**
    *   A conservative exit multiple of **7.0x** is chosen, below historical averages to reflect potential market normalization.
    *   *Implied Terminal Value: $1,049M * 7.0 = **$7,343M***
    *   **Decision:** The lower of the two terminal values is selected to maintain a conservative stance. **Terminal Value = $7,343M**.

---

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   *Calculation: $621/(1.0934)^1 + $655/(1.0934)^2 + $676/(1.0934)^3 + $696/(1.0934)^4 + $715/(1.0934)^5 = **$2,581M***
*   **PV of Terminal Value:**
    *   *Calculation: $7,343M / (1.0934)^5 = **$4,704M***
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   *Calculation: $2,581M (PV of FCFF) + $4,704M (PV of TV) = **$7,285M***
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash`
    *   *Calculation: $7,285M - $1,774M + $200.6M = **$5,712M***

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   *Calculation: $5,712M / 57.0M = **$100.21***

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $100.21**. Assumes successful navigation of the current downturn with a return to modest growth and stable margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $65.00**. Assumes prolonged revenue decline (-2% annually) and margin compression to 19% due to competition and waning brand relevance, resulting in lower cash flows.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $140.00**. Assumes a quicker-than-expected rebound in the U.S., sustained high-single-digit international growth (6% annually), and margin expansion back to 25% levels, leading to significantly higher FCFF.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A **30%** margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate to account for forecast uncertainty and macroeconomic risks.
    *   *Calculation: $100.21 * (1 - 0.30) = **$70.15***

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Fashion & Trend Risk:** The core product's popularity could decline as consumer tastes shift. The current slowdown in North America may be an early indicator of this.
2.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As a discretionary product, sales are sensitive to consumer confidence and spending power, which management has highlighted as a key risk in the U.S.
3.  **HEYDUDE Brand Integration:** The recent large impairment charge on HEYDUDE intangibles signals significant challenges in stabilizing and growing the brand as originally anticipated.
4.  **Input Cost & Tariff Volatility:** The business is exposed to fluctuations in material costs and geopolitical trade policies, which directly impacted margin guidance for Q3 2025.
5.  **Competitive Pressure:** The footwear market is intensely competitive. Management noted a cyclical trend back towards athletic brands, which could draw shelf space and consumer dollars away from Crocs.

final answer is 100.21 $
