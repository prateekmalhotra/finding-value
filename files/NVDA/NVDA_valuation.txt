**B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION**
*   **Revenue Outlook (Q2 FY2026):** "Total revenue is expected to be 45 billion plus or minus 2%."
*   **Gross Margins Outlook (Q2 FY2026):** "GAAP and non-GAAP gross margins are expected to be 71.8% and 72% respectively, plus or minus 50 basis points. We expect better Blackwell profitability to drive modest sequential improvement in gross margins. We are continuing to work towards achieving gross margins in the mid-70s range late this year."
*   **Operating Expenses Outlook (FY2026):** "GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 5.7 billion and 4 billion respectively, and we continue to expect full year fiscal year '26 operating expense growth to be in the mid 30% range."
*   **China Export Control Impact (Q2 FY2026):** "Note, our outlook reflects a loss in H20 revenue of approximately $8 billion for the second quarter."

**C) FORECAST HORIZON AND CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**
Units: USD Millions.

**3) Forecast Revenue for Years 1â€“5:**
*   **FY2026 (Year 1) Revenue:** $176,400 million. (Calculated as Q1 FY2026 actual revenue of $44,100 million plus three quarters at the lower end of Q2 FY2026 guidance, i.e., $45,000 million * 0.98 = $44,100 million per quarter).
    *   Rationale: Uses actual Q1 revenue and the conservative lower end of Q2 guidance. Assumes no further sequential growth for Q3 and Q4, reflecting a highly conservative stance given the China export control impact and general uncertainty beyond short-term guidance.
*   **FY2027-FY2030 (Years 2-5) Annual Revenue Growth:** 1.8%. (US long-run real GDP growth).
    *   Rationale: As no long-term revenue growth guidance is available, the most conservative assumption (min(last 3-year CAGR, inflation proxy)) is to use the lower of the long-run inflation proxy (2.5%) and long-run real GDP growth proxy (1.8%), which is 1.8%. This avoids extrapolating historical high growth rates.

**4) Margin Path:**
*   **Gross Margin:** 68.21% for the forecast period. (Average of last 3 fiscal years: (74.99% + 72.72% + 56.93%) / 3 = 68.21% from StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025).
    *   Rationale: This is the lowest of the LTM (70.11%), 3-year average (68.21%), and management's guided low end for Q2 FY2026 (71.3% GAAP), adhering to conservatism.
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin):** 45.74% for the forecast period. (Average of last 3 fiscal years: (62.42% + 54.12% + 20.67%) / 3 = 45.74% from StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025).
    *   Rationale: This is the lowest of LTM (58.03%) and 3-year average. Given the lack of explicit operating margin guidance and the conservative approach, assuming a lower historical average is prudent.

**5) Taxes:**
*   **Effective Tax Rate:** 21% for the forecast period. (Higher of LTM (13.40%) and US Federal Corporate Statutory Tax Rate (21%)) [US Tax Law].
    *   Rationale: Using the higher statutory rate of 21% as it is more conservative than recent effective tax rates.

**6) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex (% of Revenue):** 3.67% for the forecast period. (Higher of LTM (2.76%) and 3-year average as % of revenue (3.67% = (2.48% + 1.75% + 6.79%) / 3) from StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025).
    *   Rationale: This is the higher of the LTM and 3-year average as a percentage of revenue, consistent with a conservative approach when no explicit management guidance is available.
*   **Change in Working Capital (% of Revenue):** 2.0% for the forecast period (cash usage). (Conservative estimate based on consistent historical cash consumption from StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025).
    *   Rationale: Working capital has consistently consumed cash, and using a conservative 2.0% of revenue ensures a consistent cash drain as revenue grows.
*   **D&A (% of Revenue):** 1.43% for the forecast period. (Higher of LTM (1.39%) and FY2025 (1.43%) as % of revenue from StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025).
    *   Rationale: Represents a conservative approach by maintaining D&A as a percentage of revenue based on a recent annual figure, reflecting asset usage in line with revenue growth.
*   **Leases:** Lease liabilities treated as debt for WACC and net debt bridge.

**7) SBC and Dilution:**
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (% of Revenue):** 6.50% for the forecast period. (Higher of LTM (3.50%) and 3-year average as % of revenue (6.50% = (3.63% + 5.83% + 10.04%) / 3) from StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025).
    *   Rationale: Treating SBC as a real cash cost and projecting it as a conservative historical average percentage of revenue.
*   **Diluted Weighted-Average Shares:** 24,734 Million. (From TTM Apr '25 baseline, StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025).

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**
Formula: FCFF = Operating Income (EBIT) * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation (SBC). Units: USD Millions.

| Year | Fiscal Year | Revenue     | Operating Income (EBIT) | NOPAT    | D&A    | Capex  | Change in WC | SBC     | Adjusted FCFF |
| :--- | :---------- | :---------- | :---------------------- | :------- | :----- | :----- | :----------- | :------ | :------------ |
| 1    | FY2026      | 176,400.00  | 80,676.96               | 63,734.80 | 2,522.52 | 6,472.68 | 3,528.00     | 11,466.00 | 44,790.64     |
| 2    | FY2027      | 179,575.20  | 82,130.68               | 64,883.24 | 2,567.93 | 6,589.62 | 3,591.50     | 11,672.39 | 45,597.66     |
| 3    | FY2028      | 182,819.35  | 83,607.78               | 66,050.15 | 2,614.28 | 6,711.23 | 3,656.39     | 11,885.26 | 46,411.55     |
| 4    | FY2029      | 186,129.09  | 85,110.74               | 67,237.48 | 2,661.35 | 6,835.40 | 3,722.58     | 12,098.39 | 47,242.46     |
| 5    | FY2030      | 189,503.41  | 86,639.26               | 68,445.02 | 2,709.20 | 6,962.48 | 3,790.07     | 12,315.22 | 48,086.45     |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (CONSERVATIVE)**
Units: Percentages.

**10) Cost of Equity (Ke) via CAPM:**
*   Formula: `Ke = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30%. (US 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 6.5%. (Higher bound of conservative range 5.5%-6.5%).
    *   Rationale: Choosing the higher bound of the conservative range for ERP adds a margin of safety to the discount rate.
*   **Beta:** 2.14. (MarketBeat, August 20, 2025).
    *   Rationale: Using a beta of 2.14, consistent with multiple financial data providers, reflects NVIDIA's higher volatility relative to the broader market, which is a conservative input.
*   `Ke = 4.30% + 2.14 * 6.50% = 4.30% + 13.91% = 18.21%`

**11) Cost of Debt (Kd):**
*   Calculated as LTM Interest Expense / Average Total Debt.
*   LTM Interest Expense: $246 million.
*   Average Total Debt: ($10,285 million (Apr '25) + $10,270 million (Jan '25)) / 2 = $10,277.5 million.
*   `Kd = 246 / 10,277.5 = 0.02393 = 2.39%`.
    *   Rationale: Calculated from LTM interest expense and average total debt, providing a direct representation of the company's borrowing cost.

**12) WACC:**
*   Formula: `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1 - Tax Rate)`
*   E (Market Value of Equity): Diluted Shares * Current Price = 24,734 million * $175.64 = $4,344,834 million (StockAnalysis.com, May 28, 2025, and MarketBeat, August 20, 2025).
*   D (Market Value of Debt): Total Debt + Lease Liabilities = $10,285 million + $1,821 million = $12,106 million [A.1].
*   Total Capital (E+D) = $4,344,834 + $12,106 = $4,356,940 million.
*   Weight of Equity = 4,344,834 / 4,356,940 = 0.9972.
*   Weight of Debt = 12,106 / 4,356,940 = 0.0028.
*   Tax Rate: 21% (from forecast assumptions).
*   `WACC = (0.9972 * 0.1821) + (0.0028 * 0.0239 * (1 - 0.21)) = 0.18159 + 0.0000528668 = 0.181642 = 18.16%`.
    *   Rationale: Calculated using the CAPM for cost of equity, inferred cost of debt, and market value weights of equity and total debt (including lease liabilities), applying the conservative effective tax rate.

**F) TERMINAL VALUE (MODEST)**
Units: USD Millions.

**13) Gordon Growth Method:**
*   Formula: `Terminal Value (TV) = FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)`
*   `FCFF_Year5`: $48,086.45 million (Adjusted FCFF for FY2030) [D.8].
*   `g` (Terminal Growth Rate): 1.8%. (Lower of US long-run inflation (2.5%) and US long-run real GDP growth (1.8%), and below Risk-Free Rate (4.30%) - 1% = 3.30%).
    *   Rationale: Using the most conservative of the long-term macroeconomic growth proxies (real GDP growth) and ensuring it is below the risk-free rate as instructed.
*   `WACC`: 18.16%.
*   `TV = 48,086.45 * (1 + 0.018) / (0.1816 - 0.018) = 48,952.99 / 0.1636 = $299,223.65 million`.

**14) Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   Exit Multiple: 15.0x on Year 5 EBIT.
    *   Rationale: A conservative multiple of 15.0x is used, representing a haircut from the recent semiconductor industry median EV/EBITDA of 18.67x (GuruFocus, August 15, 2025), adhering to the "do not assume multiple expansion; if anything, apply a haircut" rule.
*   Year 5 EBIT (FY2030): $86,639.26 million [D.8].
*   `TV_Exit = 86,639.26 * 15.0 = $1,299,588.90 million`.
    *   The Gordon Growth method (approx. $299 billion) provides a significantly more conservative terminal value than the exit multiple cross-check (approx. $1.3 trillion). The Gordon Growth method will be used for the valuation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**
Units: USD Millions.

*   **Present Value of Explicit Period FCFF:**
    *   PV(FCFF) = Sum of (Adjusted FCFF_t / (1 + WACC)^t)
    *   PV(FCFF) = $37,903.95 (FY26) + $32,642.48 (FY27) + $28,127.35 (FY28) + $24,233.19 (FY29) + $20,879.43 (FY30) = **$143,786.40 million**.
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:**
    *   PV(TV) = TV / (1 + WACC)^5 = $299,223.65 / (1 + 0.1816)^5 = $299,223.65 * 0.4341 = **$129,985.40 million**.
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   `EV = PV(FCFF) + PV(TV) = 143,786.40 + 129,985.40 = $273,771.80 million`.
*   **Less Net Debt:**
    *   Total Debt + Lease Liabilities - Cash & Short-Term Investments
    *   (`10,285 + 1,821`) - (`15,234 + 38,457`) = `12,106 - 53,691 = -$41,585 million`. (Net Cash) [A.1, 3]
*   **Less Minority Interest:** $0 (Not material). [A.1]
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   `Equity Value = EV - Net Debt = 273,771.80 - (-41,585) = 273,771.80 + 41,585 = $315,356.80 million`.

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**18) Per-Share Value:**
*   Diluted Weighted-Average Shares: 24,734 million [A.1].
*   `Per Share Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = 315,356.80 / 24,734 = $12.7598`.

**19) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Estimate:** $12.76 per share.
*   **Low Estimate:** $10.64 per share.
    *   (Derived using 0% revenue growth for FY2027-FY2030, Capex at 4.0% of revenue, Change in WC at 2.5% of revenue, SBC at 7.0% of revenue, Terminal Growth `g` at 0%, and WACC at 19.16%).

**20) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   MOS price at 25% below LOW estimate: $10.64 * (1 - 0.25) = **$7.98 per share**.
*   MOS price at 30% below LOW estimate: $10.64 * (1 - 0.30) = **$7.45 per share**.

**Current Share Price:** $175.64 (MarketBeat, August 20, 2025).
*   % Upside/Downside (Base Case): (($12.76 - $175.64) / $175.64) * 100 = -92.74% (Downside).

**10) One-paragraph Risk Notes:**
The valuation presented is highly conservative, leading to a significant discount to the current market price. Key risks and conservative assumptions include: 1) The assumed terminal growth rate of 1.8% based on long-run real GDP, which is significantly lower than NVIDIA's historical growth and market expectations for an AI leader. 2) The high WACC of 18.16% is driven by a conservative Beta of 2.14, substantially increasing the discount applied to future cash flows. 3) Revenue growth is projected very modestly, particularly with zero growth beyond FY2026 in the "Low" case and 1.8% in the "Base" case, which may heavily underestimate NVIDIA's potential in a rapidly expanding AI market. 4) Treating all stock-based compensation as a direct cash outflow further reduces free cash flow. 5) Geopolitical risks, especially U.S.-China export controls, are explicitly factored as a revenue hit in initial forecasts and could pose further downside if restrictions tighten or persist longer than anticipated.

final answer is 12.76 $
