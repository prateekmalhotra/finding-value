### **Detailed Dimension Analysis**

#### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** The grocery retail business model does not benefit from network effects. The value proposition for a customer is not enhanced by the number of other customers shopping at Ingles. Each store's value is primarily local and tied to its own product selection, pricing, and service.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as a "supermarket chain" with a traditional retail model; there is no mention of user-based network value in the business description. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

#### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for grocery customers are exceptionally low. While a loyalty program exists ("Ingles Advantage Card"), the benefits are easily replicable and do not create a meaningful barrier to a customer choosing to shop at a competitor like Kroger or Walmart for better prices or convenience. There is no contractual, technical, or procedural lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   The supermarket industry is described as "highly competitive and characterized by intense price competition" and fragmentation, indicating low barriers for customers to switch. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   The "Ingles Advantage Card" is mentioned as a tool to "foster customer loyalty" through discounts, a common and easily matched industry practice. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

#### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Ingles has some scale benefits, including a centralized distribution center and a proprietary milk processing plant, which supplies a majority of its own needs and sells to third parties. However, as a regional player, its purchasing power is significantly less than national competitors like Walmart, Kroger, and Aldi, limiting its ability to achieve true cost leadership across its product range. Gross margins are not demonstrably superior to the industry.
**Evidence:**
*   The company supplies approximately 58% of its supermarkets' inventory from its own distribution facilities, which offers some efficiency. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   The company's milk processing plant supplies 68% of its own milk products and sells 82% of its total output to other retailers, providing a secondary revenue stream and some vertical integration. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   Principal competitors include massive scale players like Walmart, Kroger, and Aldi, against whom Ingles cannot compete on purchasing volume. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

#### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** Ingles possesses registered trademarks for its private label brands like "Laura Lynn" and its service mark "Ingles Advantage." However, these do not confer significant pricing power compared to national brands or the private labels of larger competitors. The company's brand is well-established in its specific southeastern US markets but lacks the national recognition that would constitute a strong intangible asset.
**Evidence:**
*   The company lists trademarks "Laura Lynn," "Harvest Farms," "The Ingles Advantage," and "Ingles" as its most important intellectual property. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   The "Ingles" service mark registration is due for renewal on December 9, 2025, and "The Ingles Advantage" on August 30, 2025, which the company intends to renew. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

#### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** This is Ingles' strongest moat dimension. The company has a highly dense and geographically concentrated footprint, with substantially all stores located within 280 miles of its Asheville, NC distribution center. This creates significant logistical efficiency and a scale advantage within its specific sub-regions (e.g., Western North Carolina, Northern Georgia) that would be difficult for a new entrant to replicate profitably without significant upfront investment.
**Evidence:**
*   The company operates 198 supermarkets concentrated in 6 southeastern states, with the majority in NC, GA, and SC. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   "Substantially all of the Company's stores are located within 280 miles of the Company's warehouse and distribution facilities," enabling timely distribution. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   The company owns its 1.65 million square foot distribution facility, providing long-term operational control. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 4 / 5

#### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** Ingles collects customer data through its "Ingles Advantage Card" loyalty program. While this provides insights into shopping patterns, it is a standard industry practice. There is no evidence that Ingles possesses a unique, hard-to-replicate dataset or a sophisticated feedback loop that provides a meaningful competitive advantage over rivals like Kroger, which have much larger datasets and more advanced analytics capabilities.
**Evidence:**
*   The "Ingles Advantage Card is designed to foster customer loyalty by providing information to better understand the Company's customers' shopping patterns." (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

#### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Ingles operates a traditional retail model and does not have an ecosystem or platform. It does not facilitate third-party development, integrations, or a marketplace model. Its business is the direct sale of goods to consumers.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as operating two segments: retail grocery and "Other," which consists of fluid dairy operations and shopping center rentals. There is no mention of a platform or ecosystem business. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

#### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The primary regulatory hurdles in this industry relate to zoning, land use, and licenses for selling items like alcohol, tobacco, and pharmacy products. While these require compliance, they are standard for all competitors and do not represent a significant barrier that protects Ingles specifically. The barriers to entry are primarily economic, not regulatory.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states it is subject to regulation from the FDA and USDA and local laws regarding zoning and the sale of regulated products. It believes it is in material compliance. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

#### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** Replicating Ingles' asset base would require immense capital and time. The company owns the real estate for 175 of its 198 stores, its large distribution center, and a milk processing plant. This heavy ownership of specific, strategically located assets creates a significant deterrent to new entrants wishing to compete at a similar scale within Ingles' core markets.
**Evidence:**
*   The company owns the real property for 175 of its supermarkets and 101 shopping centers where it is the anchor tenant. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   The company owns its 1.65 million sq. ft. distribution facility and a 140,000 sq. ft. milk processing plant. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
*   Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 were $210.9 million, demonstrating the high ongoing investment required. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 4 / 5

#### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** As a grocery retailer, Ingles has virtually no recurring revenue from contracts. Revenue is transactional and dependent on daily customer traffic and purchasing decisions, offering very low visibility.
**Evidence:**
*   Revenue is generated from the sale of grocery, non-food, and perishable products in a traditional retail setting. There is no mention of long-term customer contracts or recurring revenue models. (Form 10-K, September 28, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **Aggregation & Scoring**

*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.15 + 0.30 + 0.24 + 0.40 + 0.10 + 0 + 0.06 + 0.16 + 0 = 1.41
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 14.1 / 100

### **Mapping to Moat Rating**

*   The weighted score of 14.1 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 threshold.
*   **Final Moat Rating:** 1 / 5

### **Moat Duration Justification**

The estimated moat duration is 5–7 years. The company's primary competitive advantages are its dense, geographically-focused distribution network and its high degree of real estate ownership in its core markets. This efficient scale provides a defense against similarly-sized competitors. However, this narrow moat is vulnerable to erosion from larger, better-capitalized national chains (e.g., Walmart, Kroger, Publix) who can sustain losses to gain market share and whose immense scale advantages in purchasing and data analytics can overwhelm Ingles' regional efficiencies over a medium-term horizon.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**

1.  **Aggressive Expansion by a National Competitor:** A direct competitor like Publix or Kroger could decide to aggressively target Ingles' core markets in Western NC and Northern GA, leveraging superior capital and brand recognition to build or acquire stores, thereby nullifying Ingles' regional density advantage.
2.  **Price War Initiated by a Discounter:** The expansion of deep-discount grocers like Aldi or Lidl into Ingles' suburban and rural markets could permanently lower price expectations and erode Ingles' margins, as Ingles lacks the global scale to compete purely on price.
3.  **Shift in Consumer Behavior to Online Grocery:** A rapid acceleration of online ordering and delivery, dominated by larger players with more sophisticated e-commerce platforms and fulfillment logistics (like Walmart or Amazon/Whole Foods), could diminish the value of Ingles' physical store locations.

### **KPIs to Monitor**

*   **Same-store sales growth (excluding fuel):** A sustained decline would indicate loss of market share and customer loyalty.
*   **Gross Profit Margin (excluding fuel) vs. Peers:** A consistent compression relative to Kroger or Weis Markets would signal an erosion of purchasing or pricing power.
*   **Customer Traffic/Transaction Count:** A negative trend suggests declining relevance of the store base.
*   **Market Share in Core Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs):** Loss of share in key areas like Asheville, NC, or Greenville, SC, would be a direct indicator of moat erosion.
*   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):** A falling ROIC could indicate that capital expenditures on store remodels and new builds are not generating sufficient returns to maintain a competitive advantage.
*   **Online Sales Penetration:** Stagnant or slow growth in "Ingles Curbside" service relative to the market could signal a failure to adapt to changing consumer habits.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**

Ingles Markets possesses a narrow, geographically-based moat rooted in efficient scale and high asset ownership within its core southeastern territories. This dense network of owned stores, serviced by a central distribution hub, creates a meaningful barrier to entry for new competitors of a similar size. However, this advantage is fragile and offers little protection against much larger national chains that can leverage superior purchasing power, brand equity, and technology. The lack of meaningful switching costs, network effects, or intangible assets results in a low overall moat rating. The rating would improve if the company could demonstrate a durable cost advantage leading to sustainably higher margins or develop a private-label brand with significant pricing power.

moat rating is 1 / 5
