**Company:** Dine Brands Global, Inc. (DIN)
**Date of Analysis:** August 21, 2025

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dine Brands is pursuing growth through several avenues. Management is focused on dual-brand restaurant formats, which have shown early signs of success, with some locations delivering 2-3 times higher sales than single-brand units. The company is also focused on international expansion and had commitments for approximately 59 new Applebee's and 179 new IHOP restaurants internationally as of December 31, 2024. However, domestic growth is a challenge, with Applebee's system-wide sales declining by 5.5% and IHOP's by 1.1% in 2024, driven by negative same-restaurant sales.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively investing in technology and new platforms to drive growth. These initiatives include online ordering, a mobile app, and a national delivery program with leading service providers. IHOP launched its "International Bank of Pancakes" loyalty program in 2022 to increase visit frequency and spending. Dine Brands is also exploring new restaurant formats, such as dual-branded locations and "ghost kitchens," to adapt to changing consumer preferences for off-premise dining.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE6kILt-KgzqonU2VKSwY6nX0icGmPgjARyA8My2AxS7y0jg1Ccb55sQejE-GjvxCoSHK1PaaPqIjhQoXKWvPcFGD16rTxV9c9puylb6ISdkMh_cx1Ewn6cPaCytGhWhQSnbcX84rM9968LPeu-, May 30, 2020]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the restaurant industry, R&D is primarily focused on culinary innovation and marketing. Dine Brands' advertising funds are a significant part of its model, with franchisees contributing a percentage of sales. For example, most Applebee's franchisees contribute 3.25% of gross sales to a national advertising fund, with a temporary increase to 4.25% through 2025. IHOP franchisees contribute 3.5% of gross sales to their national advertising fund. However, the effectiveness of this spending is questionable given the recent decline in same-restaurant sales at both brands.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a franchisor, Dine Brands' "sales" efforts are focused on attracting and supporting franchisees. The company has a substantial global pipeline, with commitments for 285 new IHOP restaurants and approximately 68 new Applebee's restaurants as of December 31, 2024. However, net restaurant development has been negative for Applebee's, with a net reduction of 28 restaurants in 2024. IHOP saw a net increase of just 10 restaurants. This suggests challenges in converting the development pipeline into new openings.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a highly franchised business, Dine Brands enjoys attractive margins. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company's gross profit margin was 46.2% (Gross Profit of $375.3 million on Total Revenue of $812.3 million). The franchise operations segment, which generates the majority of revenue, has even higher margins. However, total gross profit decreased by $21.4 million in 2024 compared to 2023, indicating some pressure on profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dine Brands' primary strategy for maintaining and improving margins is its highly franchised business model, which minimizes capital investment and overhead. The company is also focused on leveraging its scale to drive efficiencies in areas like supply chain through its independent purchasing cooperative, CSCS. The company's focus on technology and off-premise dining also has the potential to improve unit-level economics for its franchisees, which would in turn support Dine's royalty revenues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Dine Brands had 992 employees, with 396 at company-owned restaurants and 596 in corporate roles. The company states that its employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreements and that it has not experienced any significant work stoppages, believing its employee relations to be good. The company has also established six Team Member Resource Groups to foster diversity and inclusion. There is no available information to suggest significant labor issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant turnover or instability within the executive team or the Board of Directors from the reviewed documents. The company has established franchisee advisory councils for each of its brands (Applebee's Franchise Business Council, IHOP Franchise Leadership Council, and Fuzzy's Franchise Advisory Council) to foster positive working relationships with its franchisees, which is crucial for a franchisor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dine Brands has a well-defined management structure with clear leadership at both the corporate and brand levels. The company's 10-K lists a number of executive officers beyond the CEO, including a CFO, General Counsel, and brand presidents for Applebee's and IHOP, indicating a clear division of responsibilities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024. The 10-K provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for a clear analysis of the different revenue streams and their associated costs. There are no indications of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the company's accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a restaurant franchisor, the health and sentiment of its franchisees are critical. Dine Brands has a high concentration of its Applebee's restaurants with a few large franchisees—the ten largest own 81% of all franchised Applebee's in the U.S. This creates a significant risk if one of these large franchisees faces financial difficulties. The recent negative same-restaurant sales growth at both major brands is a concerning sign in a highly competitive industry.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is making long-term investments in technology, international expansion, and new restaurant formats like dual-branded locations. These initiatives require upfront investment and may not generate immediate returns, suggesting a willingness to prioritize long-term growth. The company's capital allocation strategy includes returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, but it also emphasizes reinvesting in the business to drive future growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dine Brands has a significant amount of debt, with approximately $1.2 billion in long-term debt as of December 31, 2024. However, the company generates strong and predictable cash flow from its franchise operations. In 2024, the company generated $108.2 million in cash from operating activities. The company has a share repurchase program in place, having repurchased $12.1 million worth of stock in 2024, indicating that it is more likely to reduce than increase its share count.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s 2024 10-K openly discusses the challenges facing its brands, including the decline in same-restaurant sales at both Applebee's and IHOP. The MD&A section provides a detailed analysis of the factors contributing to this decline, such as a decrease in traffic. This level of transparency suggests a willingness to be upfront with investors about both the successes and the challenges of the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K reveals that the company is subject to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, which is not unusual for a company of its size. There is no mention of any material pending legal proceedings that would bring into question the integrity of management. The company's independent auditor has also not raised any concerns in this regard.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/49754/000162828025010259/din-20241231.htm, February 21, 2025]

---
**Synthesis:**
Dine Brands Global exhibits many of the characteristics of a stable, mature business, including strong profit margins, a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and a management team that appears to be transparent and have a long-term focus. The company's greatest strengths lie in its highly franchised business model, which generates predictable cash flow, and its commitment to technological innovation and international growth. However, the company faces significant headwinds in its core domestic markets, with declining same-restaurant sales at both Applebee's and IHOP. The key variables that will determine the company's future success and a potential improvement in its Fisher score are the performance of its dual-branded restaurant concept, its ability to translate its international development pipeline into profitable growth, and a reversal of the negative sales trends in the U.S. To turn the "No" answers to "Yes," Dine Brands would need to demonstrate sustained positive same-restaurant sales growth in its domestic markets, accelerate net new unit growth, and prove the effectiveness of its marketing spend in driving traffic.
