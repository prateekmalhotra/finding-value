**Synthesis:** Ternium scores well on Fisher's checklist, with strong positions in key growth markets, a commitment to innovation and continuous improvement, and a solid financial position. The company's investments in new capacity and technology should allow it to capitalize on the nearshoring trend and the growing demand for advanced steel products. The biggest question marks are around the company's labor and executive relations, where more information is needed to make a definitive assessment. Over the next 12-24 months, the key variables to watch will be the successful ramp-up of the new facilities in Mexico, the evolution of steel prices and demand in the company's key markets, and the company's ability to continue to improve its profit margins in a challenging global environment. A sustained period of strong cash flow generation and successful execution on its growth projects could lead to a higher score in the future.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
