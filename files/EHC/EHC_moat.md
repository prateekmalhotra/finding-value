### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** Encompass Health's network effects are limited. While the company has a large and growing network of hospitals, the value to each patient is not significantly enhanced by the addition of more hospitals in other geographies. The primary network effect is local, where a denser network of facilities can attract more physicians and patients, and build stronger relationships with acute-care hospitals that are the primary source of referrals.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, Encompass Health operated 166 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals in 38 states and Puerto Rico. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   The company's growth strategy includes adding 6 to 10 new hospitals per year, which will expand its network. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for patients are moderate. While a patient can technically choose another provider, the decision is heavily influenced by physician referrals and insurance coverage. Once a patient is admitted to an Encompass Health facility, the costs and disruption of moving to another facility are significant. For referring physicians and hospitals, there are relationship-based switching costs, but these are not insurmountable.
**Evidence:**
*   Approximately 65% of Encompass Health's net operating revenues come from fee-for-service Medicare, which has standardized payment systems, potentially reducing financial lock-in. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** Encompass Health's scale as the largest operator of inpatient rehabilitation hospitals likely provides some cost advantages. These can include purchasing power for supplies and equipment, as well as efficiencies in back-office functions. However, the majority of costs are related to labor, which is subject to local market conditions.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's strategy of adding beds to existing hospitals (80-120 per year) suggests a focus on leveraging existing infrastructure to achieve economies of scale. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   Net revenue per discharge increased 3.9% in Q1 2025, indicating some pricing power and/or cost control. (Encompass Health Q1 2025 Earnings Release, April 24, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** Encompass Health has a strong brand reputation as the largest provider of inpatient rehabilitation services in the U.S. The company is recognized for its high-quality care, which is a key factor for attracting patients and referrals. However, the company does not have significant patent protection or other forms of intellectual property that would create a strong barrier to entry.
**Evidence:**
*   Encompass Health was named to Fortune's list of the World's Most Admired Companies and Forbes' list of Most Trusted Companies in America in 2025. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** Encompass Health's extensive network of 166 hospitals provides a significant distribution and efficient scale advantage. The company's presence in 38 states makes it an attractive partner for national and regional payors. The cost of replicating this physical footprint would be substantial for a new entrant.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company operated 166 inpatient rehabilitation hospitals. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   The company plans to add 6 to 10 new hospitals and 80 to 120 beds to existing hospitals per year. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** Encompass Health likely collects a large amount of patient data, but there is no clear evidence that this data provides a significant competitive advantage. The company does not appear to have proprietary data analytics capabilities that translate into better patient outcomes or lower costs compared to competitors.
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** Encompass Health's business model does not lend itself to significant ecosystem or platform effects. The company is a direct provider of healthcare services and does not have a platform that connects third-party providers or developers.
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The healthcare industry is highly regulated, which creates significant barriers to entry. Providers like Encompass Health must comply with numerous federal and state regulations, including licensing and certification requirements. The Certificate of Need (CON) laws in some states also limit the development of new healthcare facilities.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's reimbursement is heavily dependent on Medicare regulations, with approximately 65% of revenue derived from Medicare. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   The 2025 IRF Rule is expected to result in a net increase to Medicare payment rates of approximately 3.3%, demonstrating the impact of regulatory changes on the company's financials. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** Building and equipping a new inpatient rehabilitation hospital is a capital-intensive process. The specialized nature of these facilities makes them difficult to repurpose for other uses, creating a high degree of asset specificity. This capital intensity and asset specificity deter new entrants.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's growth plan includes opening 6-10 new hospitals per year, a significant capital investment. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** Encompass Health's revenue is not based on long-term contracts, but the recurring nature of healthcare needs and the company's relationships with payors and referral sources provide a degree of revenue visibility. The company's large volume of discharges and consistent growth in revenue per discharge also contribute to this visibility.
**Evidence:**
*   Total discharges grew 6.3% in Q1 2025, with same-store discharge growth of 4.4%. (Encompass Health Q1 2025 Earnings Release, April 24, 2025)
*   Net patient revenue per discharge grew 3.9% in Q1 2025. (Encompass Health Q1 2025 Earnings Release, April 24, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(2 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (4 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 0.36 + 0.45 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.08 + 0.24 + 0.16 + 0.06 = 2.76
**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 27.6 / 100

### Mapping
A weighted score of 27.6 falls into the 10 <= Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1. However, given the strong scores in Distribution & Efficient Scale, Regulatory/Legal Barriers, and Capital Intensity, and the company's clear market leadership, a conservative adjustment to a rating of 2 is justifiable. The prompt requires a conservative stance and to err downward with mixed evidence. However, the prompt allows for adjustment with justification. The strict mapping would result in a score of 1. But given the strong qualitative factors, a score of 2 is more appropriate. I will stick to the provided mapping for a more conservative approach.

The weighted score of 27.6 corresponds to a moat rating of 1 based on the provided thresholds.

### Moat Duration Justification
The moat is estimated to be durable for approximately 10-15 years. This is based on the significant and enduring barriers to entry in the inpatient rehabilitation industry, including the high capital intensity of building new hospitals, the extensive regulatory requirements, and the time it takes to build a strong reputation and referral network. The primary risk to the moat's duration is a significant change in Medicare reimbursement policies, which account for a large portion of the company's revenue. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Medicare Reimbursement Cuts:** A significant reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates for inpatient rehabilitation services would directly impact Encompass Health's profitability and could make new investments in facilities less attractive. (Encompass Health 2024 Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
2.  **Increased Competition from Alternative Care Settings:** A shift in patient care from inpatient rehabilitation facilities to lower-cost settings, such as home health, could erode Encompass Health's market share.
3.  **Labor Cost Inflation and Shortages:** A sustained increase in labor costs, particularly for skilled clinical staff, could compress margins and reduce the company's cost advantage.

### KPIs to Monitor
*   Same-store discharge growth
*   Revenue per discharge
*   Adjusted EBITDA margin
*   New hospital and bed additions
*   Medicare reimbursement rate changes
*   Employee turnover and satisfaction metrics
*   Market share in key geographies
*   Regulatory changes, particularly CON laws

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Encompass Health possesses a narrow moat based on its significant scale advantages, the high capital intensity and regulatory barriers of the inpatient rehabilitation industry, and its strong brand reputation. The company's position as the largest provider in a fragmented market gives it a defensible competitive advantage. However, the company's reliance on Medicare reimbursement and the potential for shifts in patient care to alternative settings are significant risks. A sustained negative change in Medicare reimbursement policies or a rapid shift in patient preferences would likely lead to a downward revision of the moat rating.

moat rating is 1 / 5
