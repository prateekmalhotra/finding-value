| Total Debt (inc. Leases) | $3,239 | StockAnalysis.com |

**B) Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of **$285.46**, given a WACC of 11.18% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 9.5%** while assuming operating margins remain stable at the TTM level of **13.6%**.

This implies the market expects Ralph Lauren to continue its recent strong performance, growing significantly faster than its own management's "low-to-mid single digits" long-term guidance. This is a fairly optimistic scenario. The belief required is that the company can sustain near double-digit growth for the next five years.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation**

This section builds a conservative, independent estimate of intrinsic value.

**C) Forecast & Assumptions**

My assumptions are more conservative than the market's, grounding forecasts in historical averages and management's cautious tone.

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | 5.0%, tapering to 3.0% by Year 5 | This aligns more closely with management's cautious outlook of "low-to-mid single digits" growth, acknowledging potential tariff and consumer pressures. (Q1 2026 Transcript) |
| **Operating Margin** | 13.0% (Stable) | A conservative haircut from the TTM margin of 13.6%, reflecting a reversion to a more normalized level closer to historical performance and potential cost pressures. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 21.0% | Based on the 3-year historical average effective tax rate of 20.6% and the TTM rate of 21.5%. (StockAnalysis.com) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 3.0% | Based on the 3-year historical average (FY23-FY25), which is more conservative than the elevated TTM rate of 5.1%. (StockAnalysis.com) |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 1.45% | Held constant at the TTM level. (StockAnalysis.com) |
| **Change in NWC (% of Rev Chg)**| 15.0% | Based on historical relationship between working capital and revenue changes. |

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used as it represents cash available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**FCFF Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (in millions USD) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $7,650 | $7,956 | $8,235 | $8,482 | $8,737 |
| EBIT | $995 | $1,034 | $1,071 | $1,103 | $1,136 |
| NOPAT | $786 | $817 | $846 | $871 | $897 |
| (+) D&A | $232 | $241 | $249 | $257 | $264 |
| (-) SBC | $111 | $115 | $119 | $123 | $127 |
| (-) Capex | $230 | $239 | $247 | $254 | $262 |
| (-) Change in NWC| $55 | $46 | $42 | $37 | $38 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$622** | **$658** | **$687** | **$714** | **$734** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.33%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury, August 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard market assumption)
    *   Beta: **1.54** (Reflects higher cyclicality than the market average) (StockAnalysis.com)
    *   *Calculation:* `Ke = 4.33% + 1.54 * 5.0% = 12.03%`
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   *Calculation:* `Interest Expense / Interest-Bearing Debt = $44.7M / $1,637M = 2.73%`
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: $17,290M
    *   Market Value of Debt: $1,637M
    *   *Calculation:* `WACC = (E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-Tax) = (0.913 * 12.03%) + (0.087 * 2.73% * (1 - 0.21)) = 11.18%`

**F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%** (Long-term inflation expectation)
    *   *Calculation:* `TV = FCFF_Y5 * (1+g) / (WACC - g) = $734M * (1.025) / (11.18% - 2.5%) = $8,674M`
    *   *Implied Exit Multiple:* This TV implies an exit EV/EBITDA multiple of **5.8x**, which is very conservative. (Year 5 EBITDA â‰ˆ $1,496M; PV of TV / Y5 EBITDA).
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA Forecast: $1,496M
    *   Conservative Exit Multiple: **10.75x** (13-year median historical multiple for RL).
    *   *Calculation:* `TV = Y5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $1,496M * 10.75 = $16,082M`
*   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth implied multiple is significantly below the historical median, suggesting it may be overly pessimistic. The Exit Multiple method provides a more realistic, yet still conservative, terminal value. **I will use the Terminal Value of $16,082M derived from the Exit Multiple method.**

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of 5-Year FCFF: `$497M + $477M + $452M + $424M + $398M = $2,248M`
    *   PV of Terminal Value: `$16,082M / (1+11.18%)^5 = $9,438M`
    *   *Calculation:* `Enterprise Value = $2,248M + $9,438M = $11,686M`
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($3,239M) - Cash ($2,090M) = $1,149M (StockAnalysis.com)
    *   *Calculation:* `Equity Value = $11,686M - $1,149M = $10,537M`

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Calculation:* `Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $10,537M / 63.5M = $165.94`

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $165.94:** Assumes 5% to 3% revenue growth and 13% operating margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$125:** Assumes low single-digit revenue growth (2%) and margin compression to 11.5% due to competitive pressure.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$215:** Assumes RL achieves consistent mid-single-digit growth (6%) and expands margins to 14% through brand elevation and cost controls.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   *Calculation:* `MOS Price = $165.94 * (1 - 0.30) = $116.16`

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a premium consumer discretionary brand, RL's sales are highly sensitive to economic downturns, which could impact revenue and force margin-eroding promotional activity.
2.  **Fashion/Execution Risk:** The company's success depends on its ability to anticipate and react to rapidly changing consumer tastes and fashion trends. A brand misstep could lead to significant inventory and sales issues.
3.  **North American Market:** The North American market, a key geography, is highly competitive and has faced slower growth. Continued weakness or pricing pressure here could challenge overall profitability.
4.  **Margin Pressure:** Management has noted potential pressures from tariffs and cost inflation, which could erode the operating margin expansion seen recently.
5.  **Brand Management:** The core of the company's value lies in its brand. Dilution of the brand's premium positioning through excessive discounting or licensing would be detrimental long-term.

final answer is 165.94 $
