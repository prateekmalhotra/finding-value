**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EVERTEC operates primarily in the Latin America and Caribbean financial technology space, a region with a significant underbanked population and high cash penetration, presenting a long runway for growth in digital payments. The company's 2024 annual report highlights a total addressable market (TAM) of over $20 billion, with the company's revenue representing a small fraction of this. Growth is driven by the continued adoption of electronic payments, financial institution outsourcing, and government payment processing needs. The company has also expanded its services to 26 countries, though Puerto Rico still represents the majority of its revenue.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EVERTEC's management has consistently stated a focus on product innovation and modernization of its technology platforms. In their May 7, 2025 earnings call, the CEO highlighted investments in their core processing platforms and the development of new solutions for the digital payments ecosystem. The 2024 10-K also details a strategy of growth through acquisitions that bring new technologies and services, such as the acquisition of a Chilean payment technology company.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EVERTEC does not explicitly disclose R&D spending as a separate line item in its financial statements, instead categorizing it under "Selling, general and administrative expenses". This makes a direct comparison to peers challenging. However, the company's regular product launches and platform enhancements suggest a degree of effectiveness. The company does highlight its "significant investments in technology." Without specific R&D metrics, it is difficult to definitively assess the effectiveness relative to its size.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated consistent revenue growth and customer retention, suggesting an effective sales and relationship management function. The company's 2024 10-K mentions a Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 70, which is considered excellent and indicates strong customer satisfaction and loyalty. However, without specific data on sales productivity, win rates, or direct comparisons to competitors' sales organizations, it is difficult to definitively conclude that their sales organization is "above-average."
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EVERTEC has consistently maintained strong profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross margin of 48% and an operating margin of 22%. These margins have remained relatively stable over the past few years. The company's ability to maintain these margins, even with ongoing investments, indicates a strong competitive position and efficient operations.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has articulated a clear strategy for maintaining and improving margins through a combination of revenue growth, cost optimization, and operational efficiencies. In their May 7, 2025 earnings call, the CFO discussed the company's focus on managing expenses and leveraging its scale to improve profitability. The 2024 10-K also points to the benefits of their integrated service model and the shift to higher-margin digital products.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant labor disputes or strikes in the company's recent filings. The company's 2024 10-K mentions that they believe their employee relations are good. While this is a positive indicator, there is limited publicly available data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or other metrics to definitively assess the quality of their labor relations.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at EVERTEC has been relatively stable, with the CEO and other key executives having been with the company for several years. This stability suggests a cohesive and effective leadership team. The company's proxy statements detail the executive compensation plans, which are tied to performance metrics and appear to be aligned with shareholder interests. There are no reports of significant infighting or disagreements among the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EVERTEC's investor relations website and annual reports list a number of key executives beyond the CEO, including leaders for its various business segments and geographic regions. This suggests a degree of management depth. However, there is limited public information on succession planning or the development of the next generation of leaders.
**Answer:** No

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EVERTEC's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the company has consistently received unqualified audit opinions. The 2024 10-K includes a statement on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, indicating that management believes its controls are effective. There have been no recent restatements or significant accounting controversies.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for EVERTEC is its dominant market position in Puerto Rico, where it is the leading payment processor and has deep relationships with financial institutions and government entities. This creates a significant network effect and high barriers to entry. The company's ability to provide a broad suite of integrated services, from core banking to payment processing, also differentiates it from competitors that may only offer point solutions.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in earnings calls and investor presentations consistently emphasizes long-term growth opportunities in Latin America and the Caribbean. The company's investments in technology and acquisitions are focused on expanding its market presence and service offerings for the long term. While the company provides quarterly and annual guidance, the overall strategic focus appears to be on sustainable, long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** EVERTEC has a strong balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow. As of June 30, 2025, the company had a healthy cash balance and a manageable debt level. The company has a history of funding its growth through cash from operations and debt, and has an active share repurchase program, which is anti-dilutive.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed quarterly earnings presentations and hosts conference calls with analysts. The company's disclosures appear to be comprehensive, and management addresses challenges and risks in its public communications. However, without a significant recent negative event, it is difficult to fully assess how the company would communicate during a crisis.
**Answer:** No

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal or regulatory actions against the company or its executives that would call their integrity into question. The company has a code of conduct and ethics, and its governance practices are in line with major stock exchange requirements. There are no significant related-party transactions that would suggest a conflict of interest.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
EVERTEC scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market opportunity, profitability, and financial strength. The company benefits from a strong position in an underpenetrated market and has a clear strategy for growth. The primary areas of weakness in this analysis are due to a lack of publicly available information, particularly regarding R&D effectiveness, the sales organization, and labor relations. To improve its score, the company would need to provide more transparency on these fronts. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months include the successful integration of recent acquisitions, the ability to replicate its Puerto Rican success in other Latin American markets, and any changes in the competitive landscape. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness with more detailed disclosure of R&D spending and innovation metrics. Similarly, more data on sales force productivity and employee metrics could change the scores for the sales organization and labor relations.

fisher score is 10 / 15
