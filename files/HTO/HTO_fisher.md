H2O America (HTO), August 22, 2025, analysis based on Q2 2025 earnings release, and other SEC filings.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** H2O America operates as a water utility, a business with inherent demand. The company is demonstrating growth through strategic acquisitions, such as the agreement to acquire Quadvest assets in the high-growth Houston area. This acquisition positions H2O America in some of the fastest-growing counties in the U.S., with Quadvest's active connections increasing 7% in the first half of 2025. Furthermore, H2O America is investing significantly in infrastructure, with a planned $473 million in capital expenditures for 2025, which will likely lead to rate increases and revenue growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing growth through acquisitions and organic investment. The Quadvest acquisition is a key example of expanding into new, high-growth markets. The company is also focused on securing regulatory approval for infrastructure investments, such as the advanced metering infrastructure project in California and PFAS treatment facilities in Connecticut. These investments not only improve service but also provide a basis for future rate increases.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a regulated utility, H2O America's "R&D" is more focused on infrastructure and water treatment technologies rather than traditional product development. The company is investing in advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and has secured regulatory mechanisms to recover costs for PFAS treatment. This demonstrates a focus on adopting proven technologies to meet regulatory requirements and improve efficiency.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**

**Synthesis:**
H2O America scores well on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting the key characteristics of a stable, well-managed utility with a long-term growth outlook. The company's strengths lie in its essential service, strategic acquisitions in high-growth areas, and a proven ability to work with regulators to ensure financial health. The primary areas where the company could improve its score are in providing more transparency on labor relations. The most significant factor that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the successful integration of the Quadvest acquisition and the continued ability to secure timely and adequate rate relief to offset inflationary pressures and fund its significant capital expenditure program.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
