**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While a direct comparison of R&D as a percentage of revenue to peers is not available in the provided documents, Ferrari's consistent introduction of new, technologically advanced models suggests an effective R&D program. The development of hybrid powertrains, which now make up a large portion of sales, and the continued success in motorsports, such as the victory at Le Mans in 2023, point to a highly effective R&D department.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ferrari's key competitive advantage is its brand, which is synonymous with luxury, performance, and exclusivity. This allows the company to maintain a waiting list for its cars and command very high prices. The company's deep involvement in motorsports, particularly Formula 1, also enhances its brand and serves as a testing ground for new technologies. The 2023 victory at Le Mans is a prime example of this.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [FERRARI N.V. 2023 ANNUAL REPORT AND FORM 20-F.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ferrari's strategy of limiting production to maintain exclusivity, even when it could sell more cars, is a clear indication of a long-range profit outlook. The company is willing to forgo short-term sales growth to protect the brand's value and long-term profitability. The company's investments in new technologies like hybrid powertrains also demonstrate a focus on the long term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ferrari has a strong financial position, with net profit exceeding €1 billion for the first time in 2023. The company's high profitability and strong cash flow generation should be sufficient to fund its R&D and capital expenditures without the need for significant equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** On the Q1 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed the potential negative impact of new U.S. import tariffs on the company's profitability, suggesting a good level of transparency with investors. The company also holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed financial information.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided documents to suggest a lack of integrity in Ferrari's management.

However, without more in-depth information on the company's governance and management practices, it is difficult to give a definitive "Yes".
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

Synthesis:
Ferrari N.V. scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its strong brand, high profit margins, and long-term strategy. The company's focus on exclusivity and its ability to command high prices give it a significant competitive advantage. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of information in the provided documents on some of the more qualitative aspects of the company, such as labor and executive relations, and management depth. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with more information on these points, as well as continued strong financial performance and successful new model launches. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for points 7, 8, 9, and 15 with more detailed disclosures from the company on these topics, for example, in its annual report or sustainability report.

fisher score is 11 / 15
