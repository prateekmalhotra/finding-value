Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for FY ended September 30, 2024; Form 10-Q for Q3 ended June 30, 2025; Definitive Proxy Statement (DEF 14A) filed December 9, 2024.

***

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa has a substantial runway for growth by displacing cash and check, which it estimates as a $20 trillion annual opportunity. The company is also targeting an approximately $200 trillion opportunity in "new flows," which includes business-to-business (B2B), person-to-person (P2P), business-to-consumer (B2C), and government-to-consumer (G2C) payments. Growth in these areas is driven by the global secular trend toward digital payments, expansion of e-commerce, and value-added services. For the twelve months ended June 30, 2024, total nominal volume grew 6% to $15.5 trillion, demonstrating continued momentum in its core business.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's management is actively pursuing a "network of networks" strategy to capture new payment flows beyond traditional consumer payments. This involves significant investment in capabilities for B2B, B2C, and P2P payments through platforms like Visa Direct and Visa B2B Connect. Strategic acquisitions, such as Pismo (a cloud-native issuer processing platform) in January 2024 and the pending acquisition of Featurespace (an AI-based fraud prevention firm), demonstrate a commitment to enhancing its technology stack and value-added services. The company also maintains a focus on innovation in its core business through initiatives like Visa Token Service (11.5 billion tokens provisioned as of September 30, 2024) and Click to Pay.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa does not disclose a specific R&D expense line item, embedding these costs within personnel and network/processing expenses. However, the company states it has "invested more than $3 billion in AI and data infrastructure over the last 10 years" to enhance security and develop new products. The output of this investment is visible in platforms like Visa Direct, which processed nearly 10 billion transactions in fiscal 2024, and the Visa Token Service. Without a direct R&D figure, a precise peer comparison is difficult, as competitors like Mastercard also do not report a standalone R&D expense. The effectiveness is better judged by the successful rollout and adoption of technology-driven services.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's sales effectiveness is demonstrated by its vast and growing network, which includes nearly 14,500 financial institution clients and acceptance at over 150 million merchant locations. The company continues to win business and deepen relationships, reflected in the 10% growth in processed transactions in fiscal 2024. Visa has also successfully expanded its partnerships in the fintech sector, signing over 650 commercial partnerships in fiscal 2024, a 30% year-over-year increase. These results indicate a highly effective sales and partnership organization capable of maintaining and growing its global market position.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa consistently generates exceptionally high profit margins due to the scalability of its network. In fiscal year 2024, the company reported an operating margin of 65.7% ($23.6 billion in operating income on $35.9 billion of net revenue). For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, the operating margin was 60.9%. These margins are among the highest in any industry and significantly above the average for the S&P 500, indicating a highly profitable and efficient business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (Filed July 29, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa maintains its high margins through operating leverage, where revenues from increased transaction volumes grow faster than the fixed costs of its network. The company is also growing its high-margin Value-Added Services, which are increasingly network-agnostic and represent a key strategic focus. Management's discussion highlights growth in these services, select pricing modifications, and the scalability of its data processing capabilities as key drivers of profitability. While client incentives are a significant contra-revenue item, they are managed to drive volume growth that supports overall margin strength.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316125000052/v-20250630.htm) (Filed July 29, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa reports strong indicators of positive personnel relations. As of September 30, 2024, the company's voluntary workforce turnover was low at 5%. Furthermore, based on its latest internal employee engagement survey, 91% of employees would recommend Visa as a great place to work. The company has also expanded its workforce by 10% in fiscal 2024, indicating growth and investment in human capital. There is no mention of significant labor disputes in its SEC filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable with a clear succession plan having been executed recently. Ryan McInerney took over as CEO in February 2023, having previously been President, indicating a smooth transition from his predecessor. The board of directors is composed of experienced individuals from diverse and relevant backgrounds, with an average tenure that suggests stability. The 2024 Proxy Statement shows that the director nominees were all re-elected at the 2024 annual meeting, indicating shareholder confidence.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000156459024000858/v-def14a_2024.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000156459024000858/v-def14a_2024.htm) (Filed December 9, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa’s 2024 Proxy Statement and corporate website list a deep bench of senior executives beyond the CEO, including leaders for key regions, technology, risk, and strategy. The promotion of the former President, Ryan McInerney, to CEO in 2023 suggests effective succession planning. The company has a broad global leadership team managing its operations across more than 80 countries, indicating significant management depth to handle its complex, worldwide business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000156459024000858/v-def14a_2024.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000156459024000858/v-def14a_2024.htm) (Filed December 9, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's internal controls appear robust. The independent auditor's report from KPMG, included in the 2024 10-K, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. The company provides detailed disaggregation of its revenue streams and operating costs in its financial statements, suggesting strong cost analysis capabilities. There is no history of major financial restatements mentioned in the recent filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's primary competitive advantage lies in its powerful network effect. With 4.6 billion payment credentials in circulation and acceptance at over 150 million merchant locations, the value of the network increases for both consumers and merchants as more of each join. This immense scale creates a formidable barrier to entry that is extremely difficult for competitors to replicate. The "network of networks" strategy further leverages this by positioning Visa as the central hub for various types of money movement, reinforcing its indispensable role in the global payments ecosystem.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes long-term growth initiatives over short-term profit maximization. This is evident in its sustained investments in technology ($3 billion in AI and data infrastructure over the past decade), strategic acquisitions like Pismo to enter new processing areas, and the development of the "new flows" business, which addresses a massive long-term market. While the company delivers strong near-term results, the strategic narrative in its filings and transcripts is consistently focused on building a more diversified and resilient business for the long term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's financial position is exceptionally strong, negating the need for dilutive equity financing. The company generated $20.0 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2024. It uses this cash to fund investments, pay dividends ($4.2 billion in FY2024), and execute substantial share buybacks. In fiscal 2024, Visa repurchased $17.0 billion of its Class A common stock, actively reducing its share count. This demonstrates that internal cash flow is more than sufficient to cover all growth and capital return needs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa's investor communications appear transparent and comprehensive. The 10-K includes an extensive "Risk Factors" section that details a wide range of challenges, including intense competition, regulatory scrutiny, and technological disruption. The company provides detailed breakdowns of its revenue drivers and business volumes. Earnings call transcripts show management engaging directly with analyst questions on topics such as the impact of regulation and competitive threats from RTP networks and fintechs.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Visa is involved in significant, long-running legal and regulatory challenges, primarily concerning antitrust issues related to its interchange fees and network rules, as detailed in Note 20 of its 2024 10-K. The U.S. Department of Justice is actively investigating its debit practices. While being the subject of litigation and regulatory scrutiny is common for a company of Visa's size and market position, the persistent nature of these antitrust challenges prevents a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity in the context of Fisher's stringent standard. There are no specific allegations of fraud or self-dealing by senior management noted in the filings.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1403161/000140316124000058/v-20240930.htm) (Filed November 13, 2024)

---
**Synthesis**

Visa scores highly on Fisher's checklist, reflecting a dominant business with a long growth runway, exceptional profitability, and a strong financial position. The company's key strengths are its powerful network effect, which creates a formidable competitive moat, and its "network of networks" strategy, which positions it to capture a share of massive new payment flows. The main negative is the persistent and significant antitrust litigation and regulatory scrutiny surrounding its business practices, which raises questions about its long-term operating rules and fee structures, forcing a "No" on the point of unquestionable integrity. The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are regulatory decisions and the success of its "new flows" initiatives. A definitive resolution to the ongoing DOJ investigation or the Interchange MDL could shift the integrity score, while accelerated, high-margin growth from services like Visa Direct would further solidify its long-term growth prospects.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
