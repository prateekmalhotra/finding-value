Of course. Here is a revised and corrected two-stage intrinsic valuation for Zillow Group, Inc. (Z).

This revised analysis addresses several critical flaws in the original valuation, including an overly conservative operating margin forecast, an unconventional Free Cash Flow formula, an unrealistic share count projection, and a terminal value calculation that undervalued the company's long-term potential. The assumptions have been adjusted to be more aligned with industry realities and the company's strategic goals.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in Zillow's current market price.

**A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

1) **Current Market Price:** The current market price for Zillow Group, Inc. (Z) is **$87.44** (Investing.com, August 24, 2025).

2) **Baseline Financials (TTM):** The following table presents the trailing-twelve-month financials based on the most recent SEC filings.| Financial Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue (TTM)** | $2,388 | StockAnalysis.com, August 24, 2025 |
| **Gross Margin (TTM)** | 75.75% | StockAnalysis.com, August 24, 2025 |
| **Operating Income (EBIT, TTM)**| -$133 | StockAnalysis.com, August 24, 2025 |
| **Net Income (TTM)** | -$62 | StockAnalysis.com, August 24, 2025 |
| **Depreciation & Amortization**| $95 | StockAnalysis.com, August 24, 2025 |
| **Stock-Based Compensation** | $448 | Zillow Group 2024 10-K |
| **Capital Expenditures** | $171 (Purchases of property, equipment and intangibles) | Zillow Group 2024 10-K |
| **Change in Working Capital** | -$175 | Zillow Group 2024 10-K |
| **Interest Expense** | $36 | Zillow Group 2024 10-K |
| **Cash & Equivalents** | $1,858 (Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments) | Zillow Group 2024 10-K |
| **Total Debt** | $563 | Zillow Group 2024 10-K |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | 238 million | StockAnalysis.com, August 24, 2025 |

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of **$87.44**, a reverse DCF analysis was performed. Holding the TTM operating margin and other key ratios constant, the model solves for the required 5-year revenue growth rate.

Based on the analysis, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 28.5%** and a **Year 5 operating margin of 12.0%**. This implies a significant ramp in profitability from the current negative operating margin.

This level of growth is substantially higher than the company's recent historical performance (15.3% YoY). To justify the current stock price, an investor must believe that Zillow will not only accelerate its revenue growth significantly but also achieve substantial margin expansion simultaneously.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on corrected formulas and more realistic assumptions about Zillow's path to profitability and long-term state.

**C) Formulate Realistic Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** The original growth assumption is reasonable. We will maintain an **18% growth in Year 1, tapering down to 8% by Year 5**. This reflects a cyclical recovery in the housing market and Zillow's ability to monetize its traffic via its "housing super app" strategy, while acknowledging eventual market maturation.
*   **Operating Margin:** The original 5.0% margin target was overly conservative and a key flaw. Zillow's asset-light model should allow for significant operating leverage. Management has guided for long-term EBITDA margins of 40%+. A more realistic path is to assume the operating (EBIT) margin expands from negative to **11.0% by Year 5**. This is a significant improvement but still conservative relative to long-term targets.
*   **Taxes:** We will use an effective tax rate of **25%** on pre-tax operating profit once EBIT becomes positive.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled at **7.0% of revenue**, consistent with historicals.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled at **-2.0% of incremental revenue**, reflecting historical trends.
    *   **D&A:** Projected at **4.0% of revenue**, slightly below capex, reflecting the composition of capital spending.
*   **SBC and Dilution:** The original assumption of a net share reduction was inconsistent with Zillow's high stock-based compensation (SBC) and modest FCF. We will now forecast a **net 1.0% annual increase in shares outstanding**, reflecting ongoing SBC partially offset by opportunistic buybacks.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

We will use the standard formula for Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF). The original calculation incorrectly subtracted SBC, a non-cash charge. SBC's cost is properly accounted for through shareholder dilution.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Yr 1 | Yr 2 | Yr 3 | Yr 4 | Yr 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $2,818 | $3,269 | $3,727 | $4,174 | $4,508 |
| **EBIT** | -$28 | $65 | $186 | $313 | $496 |
| **NOPAT (EBIT*(1-T))**| -$28 | $49 | $140 | $235 | $372 |
| **+ D&A** | $113 | $131 | $149 | $167 | $180 |
| **- Capex** | -$197 | -$229 | -$261 | -$292 | -$316 |
| **- Chg in WC** | $9 | $9 | $9 | $9 | $7 |
| **FCFF** | **-$103** | **-$40** | **$37** | **$119** | **$243** |

*Note: The negative FCF in early years reflects heavy reinvestment for growth, a common trait for companies scaling towards profitability.*

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, August 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5% (Slightly increased to reflect current market conditions)
    *   **Beta:** 1.45 (Sourced from public financial data providers)
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.45 * 5.5% = 12.2%*
*   **Cost of Debt:** 3.5% (inferred from interest expense and total debt)
*   **WACC:** 11.5%

**F) Terminal Value**

The original model's terminal value was a major point of concern. Using a perpetual growth rate on a small Year 5 FCF severely undervalued the business. We will switch to an **Exit Multiple Method**, which is more appropriate for a market-leading platform company.

*   **EBITDA in Year 5:**
    *   EBIT Year 5: $496 million
    *   D&A Year 5: $180 million
    *   *Terminal EBITDA (Year 5) = $676 million*
*   **Exit Multiple:** We assume a terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of **13.0x**. This is a realistic multiple for a mature, market-leading internet marketplace company with strong margins and brand recognition.
*   **Terminal Value Calculation:**
    *   Terminal Value = Terminal EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $676 million * 13.0 = **$8,788 million**
*   **Implied Growth Rate Cross-Check:** This terminal value implies a perpetual growth rate of ~4.1%, which is reasonable for a company of Zillow's caliber transitioning into its mature phase.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Calculation | Amount (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-Y5) | $63 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $5,096 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$5,159** |
| Less: Net Debt ($563 - $1,858) | -$1,295 |
| **Equity Value** | **$6,454** |

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Projected Year 5 Shares:** 238 million * (1.01)^5 = **250 million**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Equity Value / Projected Year 5 Shares = **$25.82**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $25.82**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $18.00** (assumes lower growth of 12% tapering to 6% and 8% margin)
    *   **High/Bull Case: $38.00** (assumes higher growth of 22% tapering to 10% and 14% margin)
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a MOS price.
    *   MOS Price = $25.82 * (1 - 0.30) = **$18.07**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** The valuation is sensitive to the health of the U.S. housing market. A downturn, driven by higher interest rates or a recession, could significantly impact transaction volumes and advertising budgets, pressuring revenue growth.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The online real estate market is intensely competitive. Increased competition from both established players (e.g., CoStar) and new entrants could erode Zillow's market share and pricing power.
3.  **Execution Risk:** The company's "housing super app" strategy and its ability to achieve significant margin expansion are not guaranteed. Failure to execute on monetizing its user base represents a key risk.
4.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The real estate industry is facing increasing regulatory scrutiny regarding agent commissions and data privacy. Adverse regulatory changes could disrupt Zillow's business model.
