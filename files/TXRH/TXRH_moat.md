### **Dimension-by-Dimension Analysis**

**1) Network Effects**
*   **Reasoning:** As a restaurant business, Texas Roadhouse does not benefit from network effects. The value of a Texas Roadhouse meal does not increase for a customer as more customers join the network.
*   **Evidence:** The business model is a traditional restaurant model, not a platform or network-based business.
*   **Score:** 0 / 5.

**2) Switching Costs**
*   **Reasoning:** Switching costs for customers are exceptionally low, as they can easily choose to dine at a competitor's restaurant with no financial or procedural penalty. Employee switching costs are moderate, reflected in the company's "owner-operator partnership model" which includes multi-year employment agreements and a refundable deposit to encourage an "ownership mentality."
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The restaurant industry is intensely competitive, with customers able to choose from a wide variety of dining options.
    *   Managing and market partners are required to sign multi-year employment agreements and make a refundable deposit, which is generally refunded after five years of continuous service.
*   **Score:** 1 / 5.

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
*   **Reasoning:** Texas Roadhouse has a demonstrated ability to offer high-quality food at moderate price points, suggesting a cost advantage. The company negotiates directly with suppliers for most food and beverage products, and has a dinner-only focus on weekdays which helps manage labor costs.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   "Offering everyday value" is a key component of the company's operating strategy, with menu prices that are "as low as or lower than those offered by our competitors without sacrificing food quality."
    *   "In nearly all of our Texas Roadhouse restaurants, we limit our operating hours to dinner only during the weekdays with approximately one half of our restaurants offering lunch on Friday."
*   **Score:** 4 / 5.

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
*   **Reasoning:** The Texas Roadhouse brand is a significant intangible asset, associated with quality, value, and a fun atmosphere. The company has registered trademarks for its name, logos, and some menu items, but does not rely on patents.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   The company has registered trademarks for "Texas Roadhouse," "Legendary Food, Legendary Service," and specialty appetizers like the "Cactus Blossom®" and "Rattlesnake Bites".
    *   The company's mission statement is "Legendary Food, Legendary Service ®" and core values are "Passion, Partnership, Integrity, and Fun with Purpose."
*   **Score:** 4 / 5.

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
*   **Reasoning:** With 784 restaurants in 49 states, one U.S. territory, and ten foreign countries, Texas Roadhouse has a dense and efficient distribution network. The company's site selection process is critical to its growth strategy, focusing on high-quality sites with strong demographics.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   As of December 31, 2024, there were 666 company-owned and 118 franchise restaurants.
    *   The company's site selection process evaluates local market demographics, population density, household income levels, and site-specific characteristics.
*   **Score:** 4 / 5.

**6) Data Advantage**
*   **Reasoning:** While Texas Roadhouse collects customer feedback through various channels, there is no evidence of a proprietary dataset that creates a significant competitive advantage. The company uses data for operational improvements, but not in a way that creates a strong feedback loop or barrier to entry.
*   **Evidence:** The company uses guest surveys, websites, a toll-free telephone line, tabletop kiosks, emails, letters, and social media to gather feedback.
*   **Score:** 1 / 5.

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
*   **Reasoning:** Texas Roadhouse operates a traditional restaurant business and does not have a business model that fosters an ecosystem or platform.
*   **Evidence:** The business model is focused on the in-restaurant dining experience.
*   **Score:** 0 / 5.

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
*   **Reasoning:** The restaurant industry is subject to various regulations, including food safety and liquor licensing, but these do not create significant barriers to entry for competitors. "Dram shop" statutes present a potential liability.
*   **Evidence:** The company must comply with a variety of federal, state, and local laws, including those related to the sale of food and alcoholic beverages, but these are standard for the industry.
*   **Score:** 1 / 5.

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
*   **Reasoning:** Opening a new restaurant requires significant capital investment, creating a moderate barrier to entry. The average capital investment for a new Texas Roadhouse restaurant in 2024 was approximately $8.0 million USD.
*   **Evidence:**
    *   Capital investment for new restaurants varies significantly based on factors such as concept, square footage, site work, and location.
    *   In 2024, the average capital investment for a Texas Roadhouse restaurant was approximately $8.0 million USD, and for a Bubba's 33 restaurant was $8.6 million USD.
*   **Score:** 3 / 5.

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
*   **Reasoning:** As a restaurant business, Texas Roadhouse does not have long-term customer contracts or recurring revenue streams, leading to low revenue visibility.
*   **Evidence:** The business model is based on individual customer transactions.
*   **Score:** 0 / 5.

### **Aggregation**

*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 1.91
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 19.1 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   A weighted score of 19.1 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The company's moat is primarily based on its strong brand and cost advantages, which are sustainable but not impenetrable. The competitive nature of the restaurant industry means that Texas Roadhouse must constantly innovate and execute well to maintain its position. The estimated moat duration is 8-12 years.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Shifting Consumer Preferences:** A significant shift in consumer tastes away from red meat or casual dining could negatively impact sales. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
2.  **Increased Competition:** Increased competition from other casual dining chains or new entrants could put pressure on prices and margins. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
3.  **Rising Commodity Costs:** A sustained increase in the price of beef or other key commodities could erode the company's cost advantage. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   Comparable Restaurant Sales
*   Customer Traffic
*   Average Guest Check
*   Food and Beverage Costs as a Percentage of Sales
*   Labor Costs as a Percentage of Sales
*   Restaurant Margin
*   New Restaurant Openings
*   Franchise Restaurant Sales

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Texas Roadhouse has a narrow economic moat based on its strong brand and cost advantages. The company's focus on providing high-quality food at a reasonable price has resonated with consumers and allowed it to build a loyal customer base. However, the company operates in a highly competitive industry with low switching costs, which limits the durability of its moat. A significant shift in consumer preferences or a sustained increase in commodity costs could erode the company's competitive advantages.

moat rating is 1 / 5
