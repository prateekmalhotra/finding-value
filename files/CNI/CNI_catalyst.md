### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Capital Investment Program and Infrastructure Upgrades

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CNI announced a significant capital investment plan for 2025, totaling approximately C$1.7 billion. This investment is aimed at bolstering track maintenance, strategic infrastructure, and technological advancements across various regions.
*   **Mechanism:** These investments are expected to improve network fluidity, increase capacity, and enhance efficiency, leading to lower operating costs and improved service. This can attract more customers, drive volume growth, and ultimately increase profitability and shareholder returns.
*   **Timing:** The capital plan is for the 2025 calendar year.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Minimal impact on efficiency and volume growth, with most of the benefit being realized in the long term.
    *   **Base Scenario:** A 2-3% increase in network efficiency and a 1-2% increase in volume growth over the next 12-18 months.
    *   **High Scenario:** A 4-5% increase in network efficiency and a 2-3% increase in volume growth over the next 12-18 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). The successful execution of this plan could lead to a material improvement in CNI's financial performance.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a strong track record of executing on its capital plans.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The timely and on-budget completion of the planned projects.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly updates on capital spending and project completion.
    *   Key operating metrics, such as train velocity, dwell time, and fuel efficiency.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Share Buyback Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company will continue to execute on its current share buyback program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** The current program runs through February 3, 2026.
*   **Quantification:** The size and pace of the buybacks will depend on the company's free cash flow generation and other capital allocation priorities.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-10%). The buyback program is a positive for the stock, but the impact is likely to be modest given the size of the company.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a long history of returning capital to shareholders through buybacks.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong free cash flow generation.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**

### **Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Resolution of Tariff and Trade Uncertainty

*   **Type:** Macro
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Ongoing tariff and trade uncertainty is a headwind to volumes, particularly in the merchandise and intermodal segments. A resolution of these issues would provide a significant boost to CNI's business.
*   **Mechanism:** The removal of tariffs and trade barriers would lead to increased demand for CNI's services, as it would make it cheaper and easier for its customers to import and export goods. This would lead to higher volumes, revenue, and profitability.
*   **Timing:** 6-18 months. The timing of a resolution is uncertain and depends on the outcome of political negotiations.
*   **Quantification:** A resolution of the trade issues could lead to a 5-10% increase in CNI's volumes over the long term.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%). The resolution of this issue would be a major positive for CNI and the entire railroad industry.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. There is a reasonable chance that the trade issues will be resolved in the coming year, but there is also a significant risk that they will not.

*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   News and developments on the trade negotiations.
    *   CNI's volume growth in its merchandise and intermodal segments.
    *   The stock prices of other railroad companies.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A failure to reach a new trade agreement.
    *   An escalation of the trade war.

*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The resolution of the trade issues is a major potential catalyst, but the timing is uncertain.
