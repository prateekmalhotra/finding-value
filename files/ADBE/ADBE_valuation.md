| **Revenue Growth (Years 2-5)** | 9.0%, 8.5%, 8.0%, 7.5% | A declining growth rate is assumed, starting slightly below the 3-year historical CAGR of 10.8% to reflect the law of large numbers. Historical data from Form 10-K (Nov 29, 2024). |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 36.7% | Based on the TTM operating margin and held stable, as no specific margin expansion initiatives were detailed in guidance. Calculated from TTM EBIT of $8,299M / TTM Revenue of $22,601M. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions) | Year 1 (2025) | Year 2 (2026) | Year 3 (2027) | Year 4 (2028) | Year 5 (2029) |

| Revenue | $23,550 | $25,670 | $27,853 | $30,081 | $32,337 |
| EBIT (36.7%) | $8,643 | $9,420 | $10,222 | $11,040 | $11,867 |
| EBIT * (1-Tax Rate) | $7,139 | $7,781 | $8,443 | $9,119 | $9,794 |
| + D&A (2.6%) | $612 | $667 | $724 | $782 | $841 |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | Current 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield (YCharts, August 20, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.0% | Standard market premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta (5-Year, Monthly) | 1.52 | Reflects higher-than-market systematic risk due to the dynamic software and AI industry (Finbox). |
| **Cost of Equity Formula** | **11.89%** | **4.29% + 1.52 * 5.0%** |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 3.75% | Inferred from TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt ($231M / $6,166M). |
| **After-Tax Cost of Debt** | **3.10%** | **3.75% * (1 - 17.4%)** |
| **WACC Calculation** | | |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $151,601M | 429M shares * $353.43 share price (Form 10-Q, May 30, 2025). |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $6,166M | Form 10-Q (May 30, 2025). |
| **WACC Formula** | **11.55%** | **(E / (E+D)) * CoE + (D / (E+D)) * CoD * (1-T)** |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method** | | |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.5% | Capped at long-run inflation expectations, representing a mature growth phase. |
| **Terminal Value** | **$87,208M** | **($7,651 * (1 + 0.025)) / (11.55% - 2.5%)** |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | | |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $12,708M | Year 5 EBIT ($11,867M) + Year 5 D&A ($841M) |
| Assumed EV/EBITDA Multiple | 15.0x | A conservative multiple below the current TTM multiple of 17.2x to reflect maturation. |
| **Implied Terminal Value** | **$190,620M** | **$12,708M * 15.0** |
| **Conclusion** | $87,208M | The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative and appropriate terminal value, which will be used for the base case. |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **$168.73** | As detailed above. |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$135.80** | Assumes lower revenue growth (7.5% in Year 1, declining to 5%) and margin compression (34% operating margin), resulting in a lower equity value. |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$205.50** | Assumes higher revenue growth (11% in Year 1, declining to 9%) and slight margin expansion (38% operating margin), resulting in a higher equity value. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$118.11** | A 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value to provide a buffer for estimation errors and unforeseen risks. |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The market for creative and marketing software is intensely competitive, with pressure from both established players and new entrants leveraging AI, which could impact future growth and pricing power.
2.  **AI Disruption:** The rapid evolution of generative AI presents both an opportunity and a threat. Failure to innovate and integrate AI effectively could lead to a loss of market share and relevance.
3.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a dominant player, Adobe faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny globally regarding its business practices, which could result in fines, operational restrictions, or limitations on future acquisitions.
4.  **Macroeconomic Conditions:** A significant global economic slowdown could reduce enterprise and consumer spending on software subscriptions, impacting revenue growth and renewal rates.
5.  **Execution Risk:** The company's valuation is dependent on continued strong execution and the successful monetization of its newer AI-powered features and platforms like Firefly and GenStudio.
