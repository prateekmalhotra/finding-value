### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO's core Scores segment, which generated $229 million in revenue in Q3 2025, is deeply embedded in the consumer credit ecosystem, creating a significant moat. However, the company's primary growth vector is its Software segment, particularly the FICO Platform. This platform aims to consolidate decisioning and analytics capabilities for enterprises, a large and growing market. The company reported Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) for the Platform of $222 million and total software ARR of $673 million in Q3 2025, demonstrating significant traction.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's focus is clearly on the FICO Platform as the next wave of growth. CEO Will Lansing stated in the Q3 2025 earnings call, "We are continuing to innovate and drive new capabilities on our platform," highlighting their commitment to this new, central offering. This strategic shift from individual point solutions to an integrated platform model shows a clear determination to evolve beyond their mature Scores business.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO spent $297 million on Research & Development in the nine months ended June 30, 2025, representing approximately 23% of its total revenue for the period. This is a substantial commitment to innovation. The primary output of this R&D is the FICO Platform, which is successfully gaining traction in the market, as evidenced by its $222 million in ARR. The company holds over 200 unique patents in the U.S. and abroad, which further demonstrates the productive output of its R&D investments over time.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO's sales efforts are showing strong results, particularly in the strategic software business. The company reported 43% growth in Platform ARR and 21% growth in total Software ARR in Q3 2025. Management noted on their earnings call that they are seeing "some very large deals" and are winning competitive evaluations against other providers, indicating sales effectiveness in high-value enterprise accounts. The company's direct sales force and relationships with consulting firms and service providers create a robust channel to market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO demonstrates exceptional profitability. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, the company reported a Net Income Margin of 29.8% ($385 million in net income on $1.29 billion of revenue). The operating margin for the same period was also robust. The Scores segment is particularly profitable, with an operating margin of 66.7%, while the Software segment, which includes the high-growth platform, has a lower but still healthy operating margin of 20.9%. These margins are consistently high and showcase the company's strong market position.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO's primary strategy for margin improvement is shifting its business mix toward higher-value, recurring software revenue, specifically from its FICO Platform. This SaaS model provides predictable, high-margin revenue streams. While the company is investing heavily in this transition, which can pressure margins in the short term, the long-term objective is to build a more profitable and scalable business. The company also benefits from the pricing power inherent in its market-standard Scores segment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is limited verifiable, public information to definitively assess FICO's labor relations as "outstanding." The company's 10-K states it has "never experienced a work stoppage" and believes its employee relations are "good." As of September 30, 2024, FICO had approximately 4,100 employees. Without more specific, recent data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or independent workplace audits, a definitive "Yes" cannot be supported per the decision rules.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO has a stable and experienced executive team. CEO William J. Lansing has been in his role since 2012, providing over a decade of consistent leadership. The executive team listed in the most recent annual filing shows significant tenure in their roles, suggesting stability and cohesion at the top. There is no public evidence of significant executive infighting or high-profile, unexpected departures.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations website and SEC filings list a full slate of executive officers beyond the CEO and CFO, covering key functions like Sales, Technology, and business segments. For example, Stephanie Covert leads the Software segment, a critical growth area. The regular participation of various business leaders in investor presentations and the detailed operational discussions in earnings calls suggest a deep bench of capable managers running the day-to-day business.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO's financial statements are audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2024. The company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls and has no recent history of financial restatements. The company provides clear segment reporting for its Scores and Software segments, allowing for detailed analysis of cost structures and profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** FICO's primary competitive advantage is the network effect and ubiquitous adoption of the FICO® Score. It is the industry standard for consumer credit risk assessment in the U.S., deeply integrated into the operational workflows of thousands of lenders. This creates enormous customer switching costs and a powerful, self-reinforcing brand. This position allows FICO to command pricing power and gives it a unique foundation to launch and cross-sell new software products via the FICO Platform.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is clearly prioritizing long-term growth by investing heavily in the FICO Platform, even if it creates short-term margin headwinds. This is a multi-year effort to transform the company from a collection of point solutions to a unified platform company. On the Q3 2025 earnings call, executives consistently emphasized the growth in Platform ARR and long-term strategic wins over short-term revenue fluctuations. The sustained high level of R&D spending further supports this long-range focus.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is very strong. FICO generated $374 million in cash from operating activities in the nine months ended June 30, 2025. The company has a consistent and significant share repurchase program, having bought back $300 million of its own stock in the same period, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and reducing share count, not increasing it. Given the strong free cash flow, there is no foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides a high level of detail and transparency regarding its strategic shift to a platform model. In the Q3 2025 earnings call, executives directly addressed analyst questions regarding the pace of revenue recognition, the impact of large deals on quarterly results, and the competitive environment. They openly discuss the "lumpiness" that can result from their transition, which demonstrates a willingness to address challenges and complexities directly with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company’s recent SEC filings reveals no material legal proceedings that would call management's integrity into question. The legal proceedings section of the 10-K primarily discusses litigation related to the calculation and use of its scores, which is inherent to its business, rather than issues of management misconduct. There is no recent history of major regulatory fines, sanctions, or scandals related to the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
FICO scores highly on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting the characteristics of a durable, high-quality business. The company's strengths are its formidable competitive moat derived from the ubiquity of the FICO Score, its exceptional profitability, and a stable management team executing a clear, long-term strategy centered on the FICO Platform. The robust financial model allows for significant investment in R&D and shareholder returns via buybacks without the need for dilution. The primary variable that could alter this score in the next 12–24 months is the execution of its platform strategy. A slowdown in Platform ARR growth or a failure to convert platform customers into high-margin revenue streams could challenge the "Long Runway" and "Margin Improvement" theses. To flip the single "No" on Labor Relations to a "Yes," one would need to see positive, third-party verified data such as "Best Places to Work" awards or disclosures of high employee retention and engagement metrics.

fisher score is 14 / 15
