### **7. Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program Execution:**
*   **Formula:** EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Net Income: $584.2 million (FY 2024)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 34.2 million (Q1 2025)
    *   Share Price: $450
*   **Base Case (No Repurchase):** EPS = $584.2M / 34.2M = $17.08
*   **Catalyst Scenario ($400M Repurchase):** Shares Repurchased = $400M / $450 = 0.89M shares. New Shares Outstanding = 34.2M - 0.89M = 33.31M. New EPS = $584.2M / 33.31M = $17.54. Percent Increase in EPS = 2.7%

**2. International Same-Store Sales Growth:**
*   **Formula:** Revenue Growth = (New Revenue - Old Revenue) / Old Revenue
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   International Franchise Revenue (FY 2024): $318.7 million
*   **Base Case (2% Growth):** New Revenue = $318.7M \* 1.02 = $325.1M. Revenue Growth = 3.2M.
*   **Catalyst Scenario (4% Growth):** New Revenue = $318.7M \* 1.04 = $331.4M. Revenue Growth = $12.7M.

### **8. Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**
The near-term catalysts for Domino's Pizza present a mixed but leaning positive picture. The aggressive share repurchase program provides a strong floor for the stock and is a clear positive signal. However, the recent slowdown in U.S. same-store sales is a significant headwind. The international business remains a bright spot, with strong growth that is expected to continue. Overall, the net catalyst balance is slightly positive, with the potential for a significant upside if the U.S. business can regain momentum.

### **10. Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  A sharp and sustained downturn in the U.S. economy could further pressure consumer spending and negatively impact same-store sales.
2.  A significant increase in food and labor costs could erode profitability and force the company to raise prices, potentially dampening demand.
3.  A major food safety incident could severely damage the brand's reputation and lead to a sharp decline in sales.

### **11. Final Recommendation Paragraph**
Based on the analysis, the top catalyst for Domino's Pizza is the execution of its share repurchase program, which could provide a 5-15% upside to the stock. The most important indicator to monitor is the U.S. same-store sales figures, as a rebound in this metric would signal a significant positive turn in the company's fortunes.
