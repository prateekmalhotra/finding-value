Of course. The provided valuation is a well-structured and detailed analysis. However, there are a few critical areas where the assumptions and methodology can be refined to better reflect financial best practices and a more realistic outlook.

The most significant issue is the common error in the final per-share calculation, which double-counts the effect of share buybacks. The terminal value assumption, while cross-checked, can also be strengthened by leading with a market-based multiple approach.

Below is a revised and corrected version of the intrinsic value analysis, maintaining the original format and level of detail while implementing these improvements.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

**1) Current Market Price:**
The market price for LOW is **$255.65** as of August 22, 2025.

**2) Baseline Financials (LTM):**
The following table presents the trailing twelve months (TTM) financials for the period ended August 1, 2025.

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $83,612 | (StockAnalysis Income Statement) |
| Gross Margin | 33.46% | (StockAnalysis Income Statement) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $10,507 | (StockAnalysis Income Statement) |
| Net Income | $6,858 | (StockAnalysis Income Statement) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $2,027 | (StockAnalysis Cash Flow) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $228 | (StockAnalysis Cash Flow) |
| Capital Expenditures | $2,132 | (StockAnalysis Cash Flow) |
| Change in Working Capital | $262 | (StockAnalysis Cash Flow) |
| Interest Expense | $1,453 | (StockAnalysis Income Statement) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $4,860 | (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet) |
| Total Debt | $39,060 | (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet) |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 563 | (StockAnalysis Income Statement) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market's implied assumptions, we first calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

*   **Market Capitalization:** $255.65/share * 563 million shares = $143,921 million.
*   **Net Debt:** $39,060 million (Total Debt) - $4,860 million (Cash) = $34,200 million.
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $143,921 million + $34,200 million = $178,121 million.
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield on August 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (standard assumption for a mature market).
    *   Beta: 0.89.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 0.89 * 5.0% = 8.71%*
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   $1,453 million (Interest Expense) / $39,060 million (Total Debt) = 3.72%.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt (using 24% tax rate) = 3.72% * (1 - 0.24) = 2.83%.
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   *WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * After-Tax Cost of Debt*
    *   *WACC = ($143,921 / $178,121) * 8.71% + ($34,200 / $178,121) * 2.83% = 7.04% + 0.54% = 7.58%*

**3-5) Market-Implied Growth and Margin:**

Using a DCF model with the baseline financials, a 7.58% WACC, and a 2.5% terminal growth rate, we can solve for the assumptions that justify the **$255.65** market price. Holding the LTM operating margin of **12.57%** constant, the model requires a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of 4.9%**.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify today's stock price, one must believe Lowe's can grow its revenue at approximately **4.9% annually for the next five years** while maintaining its current operating margin of **12.57%**.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Corrected Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on realistic, evidence-based assumptions and corrected methodology.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6-7) Revenue for Years 1â€“5:**
The market-implied 4.9% growth appears aggressive given recent performance and a mature market. A more conservative forecast is prudent, reflecting a gradual normalization of the housing market and consumer spending.
*   **Revenue Growth Assumption:** 2.0% in Year 1, increasing to 3.5% by Year 3, and tapering to 3.0% in Years 4 and 5. This represents a realistic but not overly optimistic recovery.

**8) Margin Path:**
Lowe's has demonstrated operational efficiency. The LTM operating margin is 12.57%, and the 3-year average is ~12.9%. Management's focus on productivity supports stable profitability.
*   **Operating Margin Assumption:** A constant **12.75%** operating margin is a balanced assumption, slightly above LTM but in line with recent historical performance.

**9) Taxes:**
The company's effective tax rate has been stable.
*   **Tax Rate Assumption:** A constant **24.0%** effective tax rate.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** Historically, capex has remained a consistent percentage of sales.
    *   **Capex Assumption:** 2.2% of annual revenue.
*   **Working Capital:** The change in non-cash working capital is modeled as a percentage of revenue growth.
    *   **Change in Working Capital Assumption:** 10% of the year-over-year change in revenue.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (SBC):** SBC will be subtracted from FCFF as a non-cash expense that impacts shareholder value. It is grown in line with revenue from the $228 million TTM baseline.
*   **Share Count:** FCFF is calculated *before* cash is used for share repurchases. Therefore, to avoid double-counting the benefit of buybacks, the final equity value must be divided by the **current** number of shares outstanding. No future share count projection is needed for the valuation itself.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Forecast:**
The formula used is: *FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital.* D&A is assumed to be 2.4% of revenue.

| (USD, millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $85,284 | $87,416 | $89,627 | $92,315 | $95,085 |
| EBIT (12.75%) | $10,874 | $11,146 | $11,427 | $11,770 | $12,121 |
| EBIT (1-T) | $8,264 | $8,471 | $8,685 | $8,945 | $9,212 |
| D&A | $2,047 | $2,098 | $2,151 | $2,216 | $2,282 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($233) | ($238) | ($243) | ($250) | ($258) |
| Capex | ($1,876) | ($1,923) | ($1,972) | ($2,031) | ($2,092) |
| Change in WC | ($167) | ($213) | ($221) | ($269) | ($277) |
| **FCFF** | **$8,035** | **$8,195** | **$8,400** | **$8,611** | **$8,867** |

**13) Rationale for FCFF:** FCFF is used because it represents the cash available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure decisions like share buybacks or debt repayment.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

The WACC calculated in Part 1 remains valid for this analysis.
**WACC = 7.58%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Exit Multiple Method:**
A terminal value based on a realistic EV/EBITDA multiple is often more grounded in market realities for a mature company than a perpetuity growth formula. Lowe's has historically traded in a 10x-14x EV/EBITDA range. A **12.5x multiple** is a reasonable assumption for a stable, high-quality market leader in its mature phase.
*   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($12,121M) + Year 5 D&A ($2,282M) = $14,403 million.
*   *Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple*
*   *Terminal Value = $14,403 million * 12.5 = $180,038 million*

**18) Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
We can verify this multiple with the Gordon Growth method, using a long-term growth rate `g` of 2.5%.
*   *Implied Terminal Value = (FCFF_5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)*
*   *Implied Terminal Value = ($8,867 * 1.025) / (0.0758 - 0.025) = $9,089 / 0.0508 = $178,917 million*
This implies an exit multiple of 12.4x ($178,917 / $14,403), which strongly corroborates our 12.5x assumption. The Exit Multiple method will be used for the final calculation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value:**
The Enterprise Value is the sum of the present value (PV) of the 5-year FCFF and the PV of the terminal value.
*   PV of 5-Year FCFF = $7,469 + $7,092 + $6,758 + $6,427 + $6,145 = **$33,891 million**.
*   PV of Terminal Value = $180,038 / (1 + 0.0758)^5 = **$124,792 million**.
*   **Enterprise Value = $33,891 + $124,792 = $158,683 million.**

**20) Equity Value:**
*   *Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
*   **Equity Value = $158,683 million - $34,200 million = $124,483 million.**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
The present Equity Value is divided by the **current** diluted shares outstanding to determine the intrinsic value per share. Using a future, reduced share count would incorrectly double-count the effect of buybacks.
*   Current Diluted Shares: 563 million.
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $124,483 million / 563 million shares = $221.11 per share.**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $221.11:** Assumes a modest revenue recovery, stable margins, and a 12.5x exit multiple.
*   **Low/Bear Case: ~$172:** Assumes flat revenue growth, margin compression to 12.0%, and a lower exit multiple of 11.0x due to a weaker economic outlook.
*   **High/Bull Case: ~$265:** Assumes stronger revenue growth (4% CAGR), modest margin expansion to 13.0%, and a higher exit multiple of 13.5x.

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
A 25% margin of safety provides a prudent entry point against forecasting errors.
*   **MOS Price = $221.11 * (1 - 0.25) = $165.83.**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a home improvement retailer, Lowe's performance is highly correlated with the health of the housing market, interest rates, and overall consumer discretionary spending.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The company faces intense competition from The Home Depot, as well as smaller specialty retailers and online merchants, which could pressure market share and margins.
3.  **Inventory Management:** Misjudging consumer demand can lead to inventory buildups or shortages, impacting cash flow and profitability.
4.  **Input Cost Inflation:** Volatility in costs for raw materials, transportation, and labor can compress margins if not fully passed on to consumers.

**final answer is 221.11 $**
