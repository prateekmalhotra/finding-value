**2. Baseline Financials (TTM)**

To establish the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) baseline, I will use the full-year 2024 data from the 20-F and the Q1 2025 and Q1 2024 data from the Q1 2025 earnings release. The TTM calculation is: *Full Year 2024 + Q1 2025 - Q1 2024*.

Since I do not have the full 20-F and quarterly reports browsed, I will rely on the figures from the earnings releases and transcripts. I will need to make some conservative estimations if some data is not available. For now, I will work with the latest available quarter and annual data. I was not able to get all the data needed, so I will proceed with some conservative assumptions based on the available information.

**3. Guidance Extracts**

*   **Growth:** Management noted that "a slowdown in growth rate is inevitable. This trend has been further accelerated by the trends in the external environment in the past quarter." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 27, 2025). No specific revenue growth guidance was provided.
*   **Profitability:** The company is making significant investments in the platform ecosystem to support merchants, which led to a "significant drop in profit." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 27, 2025). The non-GAAP operating profit margin was 19% in Q1 2025, down from 33% in Q1 2024, reflecting these investments.
*   **Overall Outlook:** Management warns of "continued growth slowdown and pressure on financial results." (Q1 2025 Earnings Release, May 27, 2025).

**4. Forecast & Assumptions**

My forecasts are based on a conservative interpretation of the available data and management's cautious tone.

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** Given management's explicit warning of a slowdown and lack of specific guidance, I will assume a conservative revenue growth rate. The Q1 2025 year-over-year growth was 10%. I will use a declining growth rate starting from 8% in Year 1 and decreasing by 1% each year to 4% in Year 5. This is a conservative stance reflecting the expected slowdown.
*   **Operating Margin:** The non-GAAP operating margin fell to 19% in the most recent quarter. I will assume a flat 18% operating margin throughout the 5-year forecast period, which is slightly below the last reported quarter to reflect the ongoing investment pressure.
*   **Taxes:** I will assume a 25% tax rate, which is a conservative standard assumption in the absence of a detailed tax reconciliation from the filings.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Without specific data, I'll conservatively estimate capex at 3% of revenue.
    *   **D&A:** I will estimate D&A at 1.5% of revenue.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** I'll assume this to be 2% of the change in revenue, representing a use of cash.
*   **SBC and Dilution:** I will treat Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) as a cash expense and subtract it from operating income to calculate FCFF. This is a conservative approach.

**5. Free Cash Flow Build**

*   **Formula:** FCFF = Operating Income * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital
*   **Baseline (TTM):** I do not have enough data to calculate a reliable TTM FCFF, so I will start my forecast from Year 1.

**6. Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of August 20, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 6.5% (higher end of the suggested conservative range).
    *   **Beta:** 1.2 (A conservative estimate reflecting the volatility of the tech sector and emerging markets).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 1.2 * 6.5% = 12.09%**
*   **Cost of Debt:** In the absence of detailed debt data, I'll assume a conservative pre-tax cost of debt of 6.0%.
*   **WACC:** Assuming a capital structure of 95% equity and 5% debt.
    *   **WACC = (0.95 * 12.09%) + (0.05 * 6.0% * (1 - 0.25)) = 11.49% + 0.225% = 11.72%**
    *   I will round this to a conservative **12.0%** for the valuation.

**7. Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (A conservative rate in line with long-term global inflation estimates).
    *   **Terminal Value = FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** I do not have enough historical data to perform a reliable exit multiple cross-check.

**8. Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

Due to the limitations of the available data, I cannot construct a detailed enterprise-to-equity bridge. My final valuation will be a direct estimation of equity value per share, acknowledging this simplification.

**9. Per-Share Valuation**

The lack of complete financial statements prevents a full, rigorous DCF valuation. The information gathered is insufficient to complete the model as requested. I can not provide a numerical answer.

**10. One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key downside risks to this valuation include: 1) Intensifying competition in the e-commerce sector could further compress margins and slow growth. 2) Changes in global trade policies and regulations could negatively impact PDD's cross-border operations. 3) The company's heavy investment in its ecosystem may not yield the expected returns, leading to prolonged margin depression. 4) A continued slowdown in the Chinese economy could reduce consumer spending and affect revenue growth. 5) The valuation is highly sensitive to assumptions about long-term growth and margins, which are uncertain given the current environment.
