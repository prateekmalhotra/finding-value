Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc., August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix Energy Solutions Group operates in three key areas with long-term growth potential: well intervention, decommissioning, and renewables. The company's well intervention services extend the life of existing offshore oil and gas wells, a cost-effective solution for energy producers. The growing number of aging offshore wells globally creates a multi-year runway for decommissioning services, driven by regulatory requirements. Furthermore, Helix's robotics segment is expanding into the offshore renewable energy market, particularly in wind farm construction and maintenance. As of December 31, 2024, the company reported a backlog of $1.4 billion, a significant increase from $850 million at the end of 2023, indicating strong near-to-medium term demand.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively expanding the company's service offerings, particularly in growth markets like renewable energy. In 2024, revenues from offshore renewable energy contracts accounted for 51% of the global Robotics segment revenues, demonstrating a clear pivot towards this expanding market. The company has also formed a Subsea Services Alliance with SLB to jointly develop new technologies, such as a 15K intervention riser system (IRS) and the Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (ROAM), to enhance their well intervention capabilities. This commitment to both market expansion and technological development indicates a focus on future growth. Recent earnings calls highlight new, multi-year contracts in Brazil and the Gulf of Mexico, securing utilization and demonstrating continued development of their core markets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix does not report R&D spending as a separate line item, which is common for an asset-heavy services company. However, its effectiveness can be measured by its development of specialized assets and alliances. The company's joint development of the 15K IRS and the ROAM with SLB is evidence of effective, targeted development to meet deepwater challenges. The company has also made significant capital upgrades to its vessels, such as the Seawell, to extend their useful economic lives and enhance capabilities. The expansion of the Robotics segment into renewable energy services like cable burial and site clearance indicates an ability to adapt existing technology to new, growing markets. The effectiveness appears to stem from strategic partnerships and capital upgrades rather than a large, formal R&D department.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's ability to secure a diverse and high-quality customer base suggests an effective sales and marketing effort. In 2024, Helix served over 90 customers, including major energy producers like Shell and Talos, which each accounted for 12% of consolidated revenues. The significant increase in backlog to $1.4 billion by the end of 2024, up from $850 million the prior year, is a direct result of securing new, multi-year contracts at improved rates. This includes a three-year contract with Petrobras, a two-year contract with Shell in the Gulf of Mexico, and a contract extension with Trident Energy. This success in winning large, multi-year contracts against competitors demonstrates an above-average sales capability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix's overall gross margin was 16% in both 2024 and 2023. Profitability varies significantly by segment. In 2024, the Robotics segment achieved a strong 30% gross margin, and Well Intervention improved to 13% from 7% in the prior year. However, the Shallow Water Abandonment segment posted a negative gross margin in 2024 due to a softer market, a sharp decline from its 26% margin in 2023. While the company's overall margins are positive and improving in key segments, the volatility and negative margins in one segment suggest that, on a consolidated basis, they are not consistently "worthwhile" in Fisher's sense of being high and stable.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving margins through better pricing and higher utilization. The 2024 10-K notes that new contracts secured during the year were at improved rates, which directly contributed to the gross profit increase in the Well Intervention segment from $47.2 million in 2023 to $110.6 million in 2024. The company is also managing its fleet to maximize utilization, which rose to 90% in Well Intervention in 2024. Management's discussion in earnings calls emphasizes securing long-term contracts to improve visibility and pricing power, which are key levers for margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLX/transcripts/"](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLX/transcripts/) (2024-2025), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix emphasizes a strong safety culture, stating its corporate vision is a "zero-incident workplace" and that every employee has "STOP WORK" authority. The company provides extensive training through its QHSE management systems. As of December 31, 2024, the company's global voluntary annual turnover rate was 14%, and its worldwide workforce represented 40 different nationalities. The company had 446 employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and states that it considers its overall relationship with employees to be satisfactory. While these are positive indicators, there is no specific evidence to suggest they are "outstanding" relative to peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows considerable stability and experience. Owen Kratz has been with the company since 1984 and has served as CEO for the majority of the time since 1997. The other named executive officers—Erik Staffeldt (CFO), Scott Sparks (COO), and Kenneth Neikirk (General Counsel)—all have long tenures with the company, having joined in 2009, 2001, and 2007, respectively. This long-term stability at the senior level suggests a cohesive and effective executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses four named executive officers responsible for key functions: CEO, CFO, COO, and General Counsel. The stability of this top-level team is a positive. However, the filings do not provide significant detail on the next layer of management responsible for specific regions or business segments. While the long tenure of the executive team suggests a stable operation, there is insufficient public information to confirm the depth of management talent beyond the named officers and any formal succession planning.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down revenues and gross profit for its four distinct business units, which allows for clear cost and profitability analysis by segment. The company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The 10-K also includes a "Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting," which concludes that such controls were effective. There is no history of material restatements or control weaknesses noted.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix's key competitive advantage is its fleet of purpose-built well intervention vessels, which offer a more cost-effective solution for subsea well maintenance and decommissioning compared to traditional drilling rigs. The company's specialized assets, such as the Q4000, Q5000, and Q7000, are designed for specific tasks, allowing for higher efficiency and lower operating costs. This asset specialization provides a structural advantage in the well intervention and decommissioning markets. Furthermore, the company's expansion into providing services for offshore renewable energy projects demonstrates an ability to leverage its core competencies in subsea robotics and vessel operations to enter adjacent, high-growth markets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. The company is actively investing in the growing renewables and decommissioning markets, which positions it for the global energy transition, even if near-term oil and gas activity fluctuates. The strategy of securing multi-year contracts, sometimes at the expense of higher spot market rates, also points to a focus on long-term stability and profitability. Earnings call discussions consistently focus on backlog growth and securing long-term utilization for the fleet, rather than maximizing profit in a single quarter.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLX/transcripts/"](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLX/transcripts/) (2024-2025), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is solid. As of December 31, 2024, Helix had $368 million in cash and cash equivalents and net working capital of $405 million. The company generated $186 million in cash from operating activities in 2024. Management is actively returning cash to shareholders, having repurchased $29.6 million of common stock in 2024 under a $200 million authorization. While the company did issue 1.5 million shares as partial consideration for a convertible debt repurchase in 2023, its primary funding for operations and growth appears to be cash flow from operations and existing liquidity, not new equity issuance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion in the 10-K and earnings calls appears candid. The MD&A section of the 10-K openly discusses the challenges and market softness that led to the poor performance of the Shallow Water Abandonment segment in 2024, noting a 32% decrease in revenue and a negative gross margin. Risk factors are detailed and specific to the business. In earnings calls, management addresses analyst questions directly regarding segment performance, vessel downtime, and market outlook. This transparency in discussing both positive and negative aspects of the business suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLX/transcripts/"](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLX/transcripts/) (2024-2025), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K details a robust ethics and compliance program designed to prevent bribery and corruption, including a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The report from the independent auditor, KPMG LLP, was unqualified, and management certified the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section and risk factors does not reveal any material litigation or regulatory actions that would call the integrity of management into question. There is no evidence to suggest anything other than a management team of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm"](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm) (February 26, 2025)

Synthesis:
Helix Energy Solutions Group scores well on many of Fisher's points, demonstrating a strong market position with a long runway in its core and emerging markets, a stable and experienced executive team, and a solid financial footing. Its primary strengths are its specialized assets that provide a competitive advantage and its clear strategy to grow with the global energy transition into renewables and decommissioning. The main weaknesses identified are the lack of consistent, high-profit margins across all segments and insufficient public information regarding management depth below the executive level. The score could improve significantly in the next 12-24 months if the Shallow Water Abandonment segment returns to profitability, which would lift the company's consolidated margins. A "No" on profit margins would flip to "Yes" with evidence of sustained gross margins above 20% at the consolidated level. The "No" on management depth could be changed with enhanced disclosures around succession planning or profiles of key operational leaders by segment.

fisher score is 12 / 15
