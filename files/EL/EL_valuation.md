Of course. Here is a critical review and revised version of the intrinsic valuation analysis for The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL).

### **Critique of the Original Analysis**

The provided valuation is well-structured and follows a sound DCF methodology. However, it contains several assumptions that are arguably overly conservative, leading to a low valuation that may not accurately reflect the company's long-term potential.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1.  **Operating Margin Assumption:** The base case assumes a recovery to a 9.75% operating margin, which is simply the average of three of the company's worst-performing years (FY23-FY25). For a company with a history of margins between 15% and 20%, capping the recovery at this low level is a significant and likely unrealistic constraint. A successful turnaround should yield better profitability.
2.  **Terminal Value Calculation:** The analysis correctly identifies that the Gordon Growth Method (GGM) produces an unrealistically low implied exit multiple of 8.9x. However, its choice of a 13.0x exit multiple for the base case, while an improvement, still appears conservative. Premium beauty and luxury companies with strong global brands (like L'Oréal, LVMH, and historically EL itself) typically command higher multiples in a stabilized environment, often in the 15x-20x range. A 13.0x multiple might be more appropriate for a bear-case scenario.
3.  **Revenue Growth:** The initial 6.0% growth assumption is reasonable but could be slightly understated for the first 1-2 years of a recovery cycle as the company laps very poor results and addresses inventory issues in the travel retail channel.

The following revision aims to correct these points by building a "just right" base case—one that acknowledges current challenges but also gives credit to the company's powerful brand portfolio and its potential to execute a successful operational turnaround.

### **Revised Intrinsic Valuation Analysis for The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL)**

**Company:** The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (EL)
**Currency:** All figures in USD Millions, unless otherwise stated.
**Date of Analysis:** August 23, 2025

*(Parts 1-A and 1-B are retained from the original analysis as they accurately reflect the market-implied view based on the provided data.)*

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

**A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$91.23** (at market close, August 22, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM):** The TTM financials for the period ended June 30, 2025, are unchanged.

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

*   **Market Enterprise Value:** $39,389 million.
*   **Implied Assumptions:** To justify the current enterprise value of **$39,389 million**, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 10.5%** and a stable **operating margin of 7.90%**.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify today's stock price of $91.23, one must believe Estée Lauder can grow its revenues at a compounded rate of 10.5% annually for the next five years while maintaining its current (and historically low) operating margin of 7.9%.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on more balanced, evidence-based assumptions reflecting a plausible turnaround scenario.

**C) Formulate Revised Assumptions (5 Years)**

My assumptions are revised to reflect a more realistic recovery path for a market-leading company with strong brand equity.

6.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Rationale:** The market's 10.5% implied growth is aggressive, but the original 6% might be too cautious for a recovery period. A more realistic path involves a stronger rebound in the initial years as inventory issues are resolved and China's market normalizes, followed by a moderation to a mature growth rate.
    *   **Assumption:** **7.0% annual revenue growth for years 1-2, tapering to 6.0% in year 3, 5.0% in year 4, and 4.0% in year 5.**

7.  **Operating Margin:**
    *   **Rationale:** The TTM margin of 7.9% is an anomaly. A key part of the investment thesis is a successful "Profit Recovery Plan." A base case should assume this plan yields meaningful results, pushing margins back towards historical norms, though not necessarily to their prior peak. A linear recovery to a more normalized level is a more realistic assumption than staying near the trough.
    *   **Assumption:** **Operating margin expands steadily from 7.90% in Year 0 to 13.50% by Year 5.** This is a significant recovery but remains well below the ~20% peak, balancing optimism with caution.

8.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Assumption:** A **normalized effective tax rate of 25.0%** throughout the forecast period. (Unchanged)

9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Assumptions:** These are reasonable and remain unchanged.
        *   **Capex:** 4.5% of Revenue.
        *   **D&A:** 5.8% of Revenue.
        *   **Change in Working Capital:** 2.5% of incremental revenue.

10. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **Assumptions:** These are reasonable and remain unchanged.
        *   SBC is modeled as 2.1% of revenue.
        *   A **net 0.5% annual reduction in shares outstanding** is projected.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $15,329 | $16,402 | $17,386 | $18,255 | $18,985 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *7.0%* | *7.0%* | *6.0%* | *5.0%* | *4.0%* |
| EBIT | $1,502 | $1,804 | $2,042 | $2,236 | $2,563 |
| *Operating Margin* | *9.80%* | *11.00%* | *11.75%* | *12.25%* | *13.50%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT\*(1-T)) | $1,127 | $1,353 | $1,532 | $1,677 | $1,922 |
| \+ D&A | $889 | $951 | $1,008 | $1,059 | $1,101 |
| \- Stock-Based Comp | $322 | $344 | $365 | $383 | $399 |
| \- Capex | $690 | $738 | $782 | $821 | $854 |

| **Free Cash Flow** | **$979** | **$1,195** | **$1,368** | **$1,510** | **$1,752** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

The WACC calculation from the original analysis is sound and its components are reasonable. We will use the same rate.
**WACC = 7.23%**

**F) Terminal Value**

14. **Gordon Growth Method (Re-evaluation):**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%
    *   **Terminal Value (GGM) = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($1,752 \* 1.025) / (7.23% - 2.50%) = $1,796 / 0.0473 = $37,968 million.**

15. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT_Y5 + D&A_Y5 = $2,563M + $1,101M = $3,664M.
    *   The GGM TV of $37,968M implies an **EV/EBITDA exit multiple of 10.4x** ($37,968 / $3,664).
    *   While better than the original 8.9x, a 10.4x multiple is still too low for a high-quality, high-margin global beauty leader that has successfully restored its profitability and growth trajectory. This confirms that the GGM may be overly sensitive to the WACC-g spread and is likely understating the terminal value.
    *   A more realistic long-term median multiple for a stabilized EL, reflecting its brand power and market position, would be in the **14.0x to 16.0x** range. We will select **15.0x** as a balanced and realistic base-case assumption.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $3,664M \* 15.0x = $54,960 million.**
    *   **Present Value of TV (Exit Multiple) = $54,960 / (1 + 0.0723)^5 = $38,614 million.**
    *   **Decision:** The Exit Multiple method provides a more realistic terminal valuation consistent with sector and company history. It will be used for the final calculation.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

16. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = ($979/1.0723^1) + ($1,195/1.0723^2) + ($1,368/1.0723^3) + ($1,510/1.0723^4) + ($1,752/1.0723^5) = $913 + $1,037 + $1,109 + $1,142 + $1,231 = $5,432 million.
    *   **Enterprise Value = $5,432M (PV of FCFF) + $38,614M (PV of TV) = $44,046 million.**

17. **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = $44,046M (Enterprise Value) - $6,546M (Net Debt) = $37,500 million.**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

18. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Shares in Year 5 = 360M \* (1 - 0.005)^5 = 351.1M shares.
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $37,500M / 351.1M shares = $106.81 per share.**

19. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$107.00**. Assumes a successful turnaround with 4-7% growth, margin expansion to 13.5%, and a 15x exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$75.00**. Assumes a slower recovery with 3-5% growth, margins stalling at 10%, and a lower exit multiple (13x).
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$135.00**. Assumes a strong, rapid recovery with 6-8% growth, margin expansion to 15%, and a higher exit multiple (16.5x).

20. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a price at which an investment offers a substantial buffer.
    *   **MOS Price = $107.00 \* (1 - 0.30) = $74.90.**

### **Risk Notes**

The base-case thesis is subject to several key risks: 1) **Geographic Concentration:** Heavy reliance on the Asia-Pacific region, particularly China, exposes the company to significant geopolitical and macroeconomic risks. 2) **Travel Retail Disruption:** The travel retail channel, a key driver of high-margin sales, is volatile and sensitive to global travel patterns and regulatory changes. 3) **Brand Relevance:** In a rapidly changing beauty market, failure to innovate and maintain brand desirability with younger consumers could lead to market share loss. 4) **Margin Pressure:** Inability to execute the profit recovery plan due to cost inflation or increased promotional activity could prevent the realization of projected margin recovery.

final answer is 107.00 $
