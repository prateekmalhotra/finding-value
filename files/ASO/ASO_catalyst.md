### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Aggressive Share Repurchase Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a new share repurchase program authorized on December 4, 2024, for up to $700 million, replacing the 2023 program. As of May 3, 2025, there was $536.5 million available under this new program.
*   **Mechanism:** Aggressive share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $200 million of stock at an average price of $60/share, retiring 3.33 million shares.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $400 million of stock at an average price of $55/share, retiring 7.27 million shares.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases the full remaining $536.5 million at an average price of $50/share, retiring 10.73 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–20%). Based on the Base Scenario, a 7.27 million share reduction from the 66.48 million shares outstanding as of June 3, 2025, would result in a ~11% reduction in share count, which could lead to a proportional increase in the stock price, all else being equal.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a strong track record of executing on its buyback authorizations. In the first quarter of 2025, they repurchased $99.9 million worth of shares.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must continue to generate sufficient free cash flow to fund the repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
    *   Cash flow from operations in quarterly earnings releases.
    *   Announcements of accelerated share repurchase (ASR) programs.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in business could reduce cash flow and halt the buyback program.
    *   The stock price could run up, making repurchases less accretive.
    *   Management could prioritize debt paydown or acquisitions over share repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The aggressive and consistent share repurchase program provides a strong support for the stock and a clear path to EPS growth.

**2. Catalyst Title:** New Store Expansion Driving Revenue Growth
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company plans to open 20 to 25 new stores in fiscal 2025. Since the new store program was re-launched in 2022, 44 new stores have been opened.
*   **Mechanism:** New stores contribute directly to top-line revenue and, as they mature, to profitability. Successful expansion into new and existing markets can increase market share and drive overall growth.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – February 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 15 new stores are opened, each averaging $10 million in first-year sales, adding $150 million in annual revenue.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 22 new stores are opened, each averaging $13 million in first-year sales, adding $286 million in annual revenue.
    *   **High Scenario:** 25 new stores are opened, each averaging $15 million in first-year sales, adding $375 million in annual revenue.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-15%). Based on the Base Scenario, a $286 million revenue increase on a trailing-twelve-month revenue of ~$6 billion represents a ~4.8% increase in revenue. Assuming a net margin of ~7%, this would add ~$20 million in net income, which could drive a 10-15% increase in share price over time as the market prices in the growth.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a clear, publicly stated goal and a proven track record of opening new stores. They have already opened 7 new stores in 6 states in 2025.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful site selection and execution of new store openings.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Press releases announcing new store openings.
    *   Quarterly reports on the number of new stores opened.
    *   Capital expenditure guidance and actuals for new stores.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   New stores may not be as profitable as existing stores.
    *   Cannibalization of sales from existing stores in the same market.
    *   Delays in construction or permitting.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The new store growth is a clear and quantifiable driver of future revenue and earnings growth.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Enhanced Brand Partnerships (Nike/Jordan)
*   **Type:** Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The introduction of the Jordan brand and an expanded partnership with Nike in 2025 is expected to drive sales growth, particularly in the higher-margin apparel and footwear categories.
*   **Mechanism:** The addition of a highly sought-after brand like Jordan can drive significant foot traffic and sales, particularly among younger demographics. This can also have a "halo effect," lifting sales of other products in the store.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The Jordan Brand launch leads to a 1% increase in same-store sales.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The Jordan Brand launch and expanded Nike partnership lead to a 2-3% increase in same-store sales.
    *   **High Scenario:** The new brand partnerships are very successful and lead to a 4-5% increase in same-store sales.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5–10%). A 2-3% increase in same-store sales would translate to roughly $120-$180 million in additional revenue. With a higher margin profile, this could add $10-15 million in net income, potentially driving a 5-10% increase in the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The launch is confirmed, but the exact impact on sales is uncertain.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful marketing and inventory management for the new product lines.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Company press releases and marketing campaigns featuring the Jordan brand.
    *   Management commentary on the performance of the new brand partnerships in earnings calls.
    *   Changes in apparel and footwear sales as a percentage of total sales.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The products may not resonate with Academy's customer base as much as anticipated.
    *   Supply chain issues could limit the availability of the new products.
    *   The partnership could be less extensive than expected.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a positive development, but the financial impact is still speculative. Monitor initial sales results before making a significant investment decision based on this catalyst alone.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Market Share Gains in a Fragmented Market
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** As a large, well-capitalized player in a fragmented sporting goods market, Academy is well-positioned to continue to take market share from smaller, less-capitalized competitors. The ongoing new store expansion will be the primary driver of these gains.
*   **Mechanism:** A larger store footprint, broader product selection, and more sophisticated supply chain and marketing capabilities allow Academy to out-compete smaller players. Over time, this should lead to sustained market share gains and profitable growth.
*   **Timing:** August 2026 – August 2030.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company's market share increases by 0.5% over 5 years.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company's market share increases by 1-1.5% over 5 years.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company's market share increases by 2% or more over 5 years.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A 1.5% increase in market share could translate to over $1 billion in additional annual revenue, which, if accompanied by margin expansion, could have a significant positive impact on the stock price over the long term.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. This is a core part of the company's long-term strategy, but it is dependent on successful execution and a favorable competitive environment.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued successful execution of the new store rollout plan.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Annual reports on new store openings and market share data (where available).
    *   Competitor financial results and store closure announcements.
    *   Long-term revenue growth trends.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Increased competition from other large-format retailers.
    *   A shift in consumer preferences away from brick-and-mortar retail.
    *   Failure to successfully integrate new stores and markets into the company's operations.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The long-term market share gain story is compelling and supported by the company's current strategy.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Impact:**
*   **Formula:** EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Net Income: $418.4 million (Fiscal Year 2024).
    *   Shares Outstanding (pre-buyback): 66.48 million.
    *   Shares Repurchased (Base Scenario): 7.27 million.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Pre-Buyback EPS = $418.4M / 66.48M = $6.30
    *   Post-Buyback Shares = 66.48M - 7.27M = 59.21M
    *   Post-Buyback EPS = $418.4M / 59.21M = $7.07 (a 12% increase)

**2. New Store Expansion Impact:**
*   **Formula:** Net Income = Revenue x Net Margin
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Additional Revenue from New Stores (Base Scenario): $286 million.
    *   Net Margin: 7.1% (Fiscal Year 2024).
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Additional Net Income = $286M * 7.1% = $20.3 million. This represents a ~4.9% increase in net income over Fiscal Year 2024.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for ASO is positive. The company's aggressive share repurchase program and clear new store expansion plan provide two strong, quantifiable drivers for share price appreciation in the next 0–12 months. The addition of the Jordan brand provides further potential upside. While the company faces macroeconomic headwinds, these company-specific catalysts should provide a positive short-term market signal.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Economic Downturn:** A significant recession could severely curtail consumer discretionary spending, impacting sales and profitability to a degree that would overwhelm the positive effects of share buybacks and new store openings.
2.  **Increased Competition:** A more aggressive competitive landscape, particularly from other large-format sporting goods retailers or online-only players, could erode market share and margins.
3.  **Execution Failure:** A failure to successfully execute on the new store rollout plan or a poorly managed launch of the Jordan brand could turn these catalysts into liabilities.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on the analysis, the recommendation is a **Buy** for ASO. The top catalyst is the company's aggressive and well-funded share repurchase program, which provides a clear path to EPS growth. Combined with the revenue growth from the new store expansion plan, a conservative estimate of the potential upside is in the **15-25%** range over the next 12 months. The most important indicator to monitor is the company's execution of its share repurchase program, as reported in its quarterly filings.
