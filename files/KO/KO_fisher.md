Company: The Coca-Cola Company (KO)
Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K for FY2024, 10-Q for Q1 & Q2 2025), Q1 & Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola continues to see growth in its core sparkling soft drinks, but the truly long runway is in expanding its portfolio of non-sparkling beverages. The company is actively pursuing growth in categories like hydration, sports drinks, coffee, and tea. For instance, the company has seen strong growth in its Powerade and Smartwater brands and is expanding its presence in the coffee market with its Costa Coffee brand. The company's 2024 10-K filing notes that they are "focusing on expanding our portfolio of beverages to meet the diverse and evolving needs of consumers." The global non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverage market is projected to continue growing, providing a tailwind for Coca-Cola's diverse and expanding portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola has a stated focus on innovation and portfolio expansion. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO James Quincey stated, "We are constantly looking for new ways to delight our consumers and expand our portfolio." This is evidenced by their ongoing stream of new product launches, including new flavors of classic brands (e.g., Coca-Cola Spiced), and acquisitions of emerging brands. The company's 2024 10-K highlights their commitment to "innovating across our five category clusters: Sparkling Soft Drinks; Juice, Dairy and Plant-Based Beverages; Water, Sports, Coffee and Tea."
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola's R&D spending is not explicitly broken out in its financial statements, which makes a direct comparison to peers difficult. The company includes R&D within "other operating charges." However, the company's consistent introduction of new products and brand extensions, as well as its ability to adapt to changing consumer preferences (e.g., lower sugar options), suggests an effective R&D function. The success of recent launches like Coca-Cola Spiced, which the company noted as a successful innovation in its Q1 2025 earnings call, is a positive indicator. Without clear R&D spending figures, it is difficult to definitively say.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola's global distribution network is one of its most significant competitive advantages. The company's products are available in over 200 countries and territories. The 2024 10-K describes the company's "extensive network of independent bottling partners and a company-owned bottling and distribution system." This vast and intricate network allows for immense reach and efficient distribution, which is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's ability to execute global marketing campaigns and secure prominent placement in retail outlets is a testament to its sales and distribution prowess.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola consistently maintains high profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross profit margin of 59.3% and an operating profit margin of 27.5%. These margins are significantly higher than many of its competitors in the non-alcoholic beverage industry. The company's ability to command premium pricing for its brands and its efficient operations contribute to these strong margins. The Q2 2025 10-Q shows a continuation of these strong margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000011/ko-20241231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000061/ko-20250627.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola is actively engaged in initiatives to maintain and improve its profit margins. The company has been implementing price increases to offset inflation, as mentioned in its Q2 2025 earnings call. Additionally, the company is focused on productivity improvements and cost management. The 2024 10-K discusses the company's "ongoing productivity and reinvestment program," which is designed to "drive efficiency and effectiveness." These initiatives, combined with a focus on premium products, are helping the company to sustain its high margins.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola has a complex global workforce and has faced some labor disputes in various parts of the world. However, there is no evidence of widespread or systemic labor problems that would indicate poor overall labor relations. The company's 2024 10-K states that "we are committed to fostering a safe, inclusive and respectful workplace for all of our employees." Without more specific, recent, and widespread evidence of poor labor relations, and given the company's stated commitment to its workforce, there is not a strong reason to answer no. However, given the lack of overwhelmingly positive evidence, a "No" is warranted based on the decision rules.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000011/ko-20241231.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive leadership at Coca-Cola appears stable, with a clear succession plan in place. James Quincey has been CEO since 2017, and the company has a deep bench of experienced executives. The company's proxy statement details the executive compensation program, which is designed to align executive interests with those of shareholders. There have been no recent reports of significant executive turnover or internal conflicts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000011/ko-20241231.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola has a well-structured and experienced management team. The company's website lists a deep bench of executives with extensive experience in the beverage industry and other consumer goods sectors. The 2024 10-K also details the experience of its executive officers. The company's global presence and decentralized operating structure also suggest a deep pool of management talent at the regional and local levels.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000011/ko-20241231.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, multinational corporation, Coca-Cola has sophisticated accounting and cost control systems. The company's financial statements are audited by Ernst & Young, a major accounting firm, and have received unqualified opinions. The 2024 10-K includes a report from management on internal control over financial reporting, which states that these controls are effective. There have been no recent material restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000011/ko-20241231.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola's key competitive advantages are its powerful brand, its global distribution network, and its marketing expertise. The Coca-Cola brand is one of the most recognized in the world, which gives the company significant pricing power and consumer loyalty. Its vast and efficient distribution system is a major barrier to entry for potential competitors. The company's marketing campaigns are legendary and have helped to build and maintain its brand equity for over a century. These factors, which are difficult for competitors to replicate, are a testament to the company's outstanding position in the beverage industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola's management team has consistently emphasized a long-term approach to value creation. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, the CEO stated that "we are focused on delivering sustainable, long-term growth for our shareholders." The company's investments in new brands, marketing, and innovation, even if they don't have an immediate payoff, are evidence of this long-term focus. The company's consistent dividend payments and share buybacks also suggest a commitment to long-term shareholder returns.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KO/transcripts/']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola has a very strong financial position. As of June 27, 2025, the company had a substantial cash balance and generated strong free cash flow. The company has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, rather than issuing new shares. Given its strong cash flow and access to debt markets, it is highly unlikely that Coca-Cola would need to issue equity to fund its growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000061/ko-20250627.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Coca-Cola's management team generally maintains open and transparent communication with investors. The company provides detailed financial reporting and hosts regular earnings calls with analysts. In their public communications, they address both successes and challenges. For example, in their 2024 10-K, they discuss the risks and challenges facing their business, including competition, changing consumer preferences, and geopolitical instability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/21344/000002134425000011/ko-20241231.htm']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There have been no recent, major scandals or controversies that would call into question the integrity of Coca-Cola's senior management. The company has a code of business conduct that all employees are expected to follow, and the company's financial reporting appears to be transparent and accurate. While any large corporation faces some level of litigation and regulatory scrutiny, there is no evidence of widespread or systemic ethical issues at the highest levels of the company.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

Synthesis:
The Coca-Cola Company scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its primary strengths being its powerful brand, extensive global distribution network, and strong financial performance. The company's commitment to innovation and portfolio diversification, along with its experienced management team, position it well for continued growth. The two "No" answers relate to the lack of specific data on R&D effectiveness and labor relations. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with more transparent disclosure of R&D spending and metrics, and a more proactive approach to highlighting positive employee relations. A significant product launch failure or a major labor dispute would be the most likely events to negatively impact the score. To turn the "No" on R&D effectiveness to a "Yes," the company would need to provide more granular data on its R&D spending and the returns it is generating from its innovation pipeline. For labor relations, a third-party assessment or certification of its labor practices could provide the necessary positive evidence.

fisher score is 13 / 15
