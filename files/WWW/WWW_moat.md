### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Wolverine World Wide operates a traditional product-based business model, designing and selling footwear and apparel. There is no evidence of a network effect where the value of the company's products or services increases for a user as more users join. The business does not have a user base that interacts or creates value for one another.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's business is described as a "leading designer, marketer and licensor of a broad range of quality casual footwear and apparel". (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
There are no meaningful switching costs for end consumers or wholesale customers. Consumers can easily substitute WWW's products with those of competitors, and wholesale relationships are conducted on an "order-to-order basis," allowing retailers to change brands based on demand and profitability without significant friction. The company does not employ contractual, technical, or procedural lock-ins.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Sales to wholesale customers "are generally on an order-to-order basis and are subject to wholesale customers' rights of cancellation and rescheduling". (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Wolverine utilizes a global third-party sourcing model, primarily in the Asia Pacific region, which is the industry standard and does not confer a proprietary cost advantage. While the company's scale may provide some negotiating power, it faces the same inflationary and supply chain cost pressures as its peers. The 2024 gross margin of 44.5% does not, on its own, demonstrate a durable per-unit cost advantage over competitors.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   "Substantially all of the units sourced by the Company are procured from numerous third-party manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region." (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
*   The increase in 2024 gross margin to 44.5% from 38.9% was attributed to "less end-of-life inventory sales, lower supply chain costs and lower product costs," suggesting cyclical rather than structural factors. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The company's portfolio of brands, including Merrell and Saucony, is its primary competitive advantage, creating consumer pull and enabling global distribution. However, this advantage shows signs of weakening, evidenced by the recent divestitures of the Sperry and Keds brands. Furthermore, the company recorded significant impairment charges against the Sperry and Sweaty Betty trade names in the prior fiscal year, indicating a decline in their brand equity.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company states its primary competitive advantages are its "well-recognized brand names, patented proprietary designs, diverse product offerings and comfort technologies". (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
*   The company sold the global Sperry business on January 10, 2024, and the Keds business on February 4, 2023. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
*   In fiscal 2022, the company recognized impairment charges of USD 191.0 million for the Sperry trade name and USD 189.3 million for the Sweaty Betty trade name. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Wolverine has a broad, global distribution network, marketing products in approximately 170 countries through a mix of wholesale, direct-to-consumer, and licensing channels. This scale is a competitive advantage against smaller rivals. However, the model is not unique, and large competitors possess similar or more advanced distribution capabilities, limiting its defensive strength.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's products are marketed worldwide in "approximately 170 countries and territories through owned operations...third-party distributors, licensees and joint ventures." (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
*   The company utilizes a diverse set of channels including department stores, national chains, specialty retailers, and direct-to-consumer businesses. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
While Wolverine operates eCommerce sites and retail stores that collect customer data, there is no evidence this data constitutes a proprietary, hard-to-replicate asset. The 10-K does not describe a clear feedback loop where this data leads to superior product development or customer retention that competitors cannot also achieve through their own DTC channels. The advantage is nascent and not a defining feature of its competitive position.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company operates branded eCommerce sites which it believes are "effective tools for marketing and selling to consumers". (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
This dimension is not applicable to Wolverine's business model. The company does not operate a platform that connects third-party participants (like developers or complementary service providers) in a way that creates value for the ecosystem. Its business is a direct-to-market model for its own branded goods.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's business is centered on designing, marketing, and licensing its portfolio of footwear and apparel brands. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The footwear and apparel industry is not characterized by significant regulatory barriers to entry. Wolverine's operations are subject to standard trade, environmental, and labor laws, but these do not provide a competitive advantage over peers. The company does not hold any exclusive government contracts or licenses that would prevent competition.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The 10-K details risks related to "duties, tariffs, quotas" and compliance with various environmental and labor laws, which are common across the industry rather than being a unique advantage. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Wolverine operates with low capital intensity by outsourcing nearly all of its manufacturing to third parties. This strategy avoids the high sunk costs and asset specificity associated with owning factories. While there are investments in distribution centers and technology, these assets are not so specialized as to deter well-capitalized competitors.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's third-party sourcing strategy allows it to "avoid capital expenditures necessary for owned factories." (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The majority of the company's revenue lacks long-term visibility. Sales to wholesale partners are transactional and subject to cancellation, while direct-to-consumer revenue is also non-recurring. The only source of predictable revenue comes from licensing agreements, but this is not the primary driver of the business.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   "Sales to the Company's wholesale customers are generally on an order-to-order basis and are subject to wholesale customers' rights of cancellation and rescheduling." (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (18% * 0) + (15% * 0) + (15% * 2) + (12% * 3) + (10% * 3) + (10% * 1) + (8% * 0) + (6% * 0) + (4% * 1) + (2% * 1) = 0.0 + 0.0 + 3.0 + 3.6 + 3.0 + 1.0 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.4 + 0.2 = 11.2
*   **Final Weighted Score:** 11.2 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   The weighted score of 11.2 falls into the "10 ≤ Weighted < 30" range.
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 1 / 5.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The company's competitive advantage is limited and primarily rests on the brand equity of its remaining core brands (Merrell, Saucony) and its established distribution scale. However, with ongoing brand divestitures and impairments, the durability of this advantage is questionable. The moat is estimated to last approximately 3–5 years, as changing consumer preferences and intense competition could further erode brand loyalty and shelf space within this period.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Continued Brand Value Decline:** A failure to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences could lead to further brand erosion in the core Merrell and Saucony franchises, similar to what was experienced with Sperry, leading to loss of market share and pricing power. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
2.  **Loss of a Major Wholesale Partner:** The loss of or significant reduction in purchases from a key retail partner due to consolidation, private-label initiatives, or a shift to competing brands would immediately impact revenue and distribution scale. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)
3.  **Supply Chain Disruption:** Significant disruption or cost increases from the company's third-party manufacturers in the Asia Pacific region could erase margin advantages and impede the ability to meet demand, damaging retailer relationships and brand reputation. (Wolverine World Wide 10-K, February 22, 2025)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Gross Margin:** A decline could indicate a loss of pricing power and brand strength.
*   **Revenue Growth (by brand):** Stagnation or decline in core brands (Merrell, Saucony) would signal moat erosion.
*   **Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) % of Sales:** Growth in this metric indicates strengthening brand connection with consumers; a decline may indicate the opposite.
*   **Inventory Turnover:** A slowdown could suggest weakening demand and style mismatches.
*   **SG&A as a % of Revenue:** An increase, particularly in marketing spend without corresponding revenue growth, could mean the cost to defend market share is rising.
*   **Impairment Charges:** Any future goodwill or trade name impairments are a direct signal of declining intangible asset value.
*   **Wholesale Channel Revenue:** A persistent decline would indicate a loss of shelf space and distribution power.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Wolverine World Wide, Inc. possesses a narrow economic moat, rating a 1 out of 5. The company's primary, yet fragile, advantages lie in the brand equity of its core Active Group and its scaled global distribution network. However, these strengths are actively being challenged by intense competition and shifting consumer tastes, as evidenced by recent brand divestitures and significant trade name impairments. The lack of any network effects, switching costs, or proprietary cost advantages leaves the company vulnerable. For the rating to improve, Wolverine would need to demonstrate sustained organic growth and stable or expanding margins in its core Merrell and Saucony brands, proving their brand value is strengthening, not deteriorating.

moat rating is 1 / 5
