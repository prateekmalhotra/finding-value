### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth (Years 1-5) | 2.0% | Based on recent performance and management commentary of strategic initiatives, a modest growth rate is assumed. |
| Operating Margin | 28.2% | Based on TTM operating margin (EBIT/Revenue), kept stable due to lack of specific guidance on margin expansion. |
| Tax Rate | 23.5% | Based on TTM income tax expense divided by income before taxes. |
| Capex as % of Revenue | 0.4% | Based on TTM Capex as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |
| Change in WC as % of Revenue | -2.8% | Based on TTM Change in Working Capital as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure. The formula used is:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (in thousands) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| EBIT | $3,522 | $3,592 | $3,664 | $3,738 | $3,812 |
| NOPAT | $2,694 | $2,748 | $2,803 | $2,859 | $2,916 |
| D&A | $193 | $197 | $201 | $205 | $209 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($204) | ($208) | ($212) | ($216) | ($221) |
| Capex | ($53) | ($54) | ($55) | ($56) | ($57) |
| Change in WC | $351 | $358 | $365 | $373 | $380 |
| **FCFF** | **$2,981** | **$3,041** | **$3,102** | **$3,164** | **$3,227** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.3% | 10-Year Treasury Yield as of August 21, 2025. |
| Beta | 0.14 | 5-year monthly beta, reflecting low historical volatility. |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium. |
| Cost of Equity (CAPM) | 5.0% | 4.3% + 0.14 * 5.0% |
| Cost of Debt | 0.0% | The company has no debt. |
| **WACC** | **5.0%** | With no debt, WACC equals the Cost of Equity. |

### **F) Terminal Value**

The Gordon Growth method is used with a terminal growth rate of 2.5%, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
*   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
*   Terminal Value = ($3,227 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.05 - 0.025) = **$132,303 thousand**

A cross-check using a 5.0x Exit Multiple on Year 5 EBITDA of $3,901 thousand ($3,812 EBIT + $189 D&A) yields a Terminal Value of $19,505 thousand. Given the significant discrepancy, the more conservative Gordon Growth method is used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (in thousands) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit FCFF | $14,089 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $103,663 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$117,752** |
| Less: Net Debt | ($8,721) |
| **Equity Value** | **$126,473** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$8.65** |
| Low/Bear Case | $6.50 |
| High/Bull Case | $10.50 |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% Discount)** | **$6.06** |

The Low/Bear Case assumes a 0% growth rate and a 25% operating margin. The High/Bull Case assumes a 4% growth rate and a 30% operating margin.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **High Dependence on Pizza Inn:** The company's profitability is highly dependent on the performance of the Pizza Inn brand, as Pie Five sales have been declining.
2.  **Franchisee Health:** The success of the franchise-heavy model is reliant on the financial health and operational execution of its franchisees.
3.  **Intense Competition:** The pizza restaurant industry is highly competitive, with numerous large national chains and local operators.
4.  **Lack of Growth:** The company has seen very little revenue growth in recent years, and the long-term growth prospects are uncertain.
5.  **Small Company Risk:** As a small-cap company, the stock may be subject to higher volatility and lower liquidity.

final answer is 8.65 $
