| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **3.5% annually.** This is based on the midpoint of management's 2025 revenue guidance and historical growth rates. A 3.5% growth rate is a conservative estimate given the 4-5% enrollment growth guidance. | |
| **Operating Margin** | **24.2%.** Kept stable at the TTM level, reflecting a conservative stance in the absence of specific management guidance on margin expansion. | (Calculated from Q2 2025 10-Q and 2024 10-K). |
| **Tax Rate** | **28.7%.** The effective tax rate for the TTM period ending June 30, 2025. | (Calculated from Q2 2025 10-Q and 2024 10-K). |

| **Change in WC as % of Revenue** | **-5.0%.** Based on the TTM average, reflecting efficient working capital management. | (Calculated from Q2 2025 10-Q and 2024 10-K). |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure. The formula is:

**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in WC**

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,606.6 | $1,662.8 | $1,721.0 | $1,781.2 | $1,843.5 |
| EBIT (24.2%) | $388.8 | $402.4 | $416.5 | $431.1 | $446.1 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 71.3%) | $277.2 | $286.9 | $297.0 | $307.4 | $318.1 |
| D&A (4.3% of Rev) | $69.1 | $71.5 | $74.0 | $76.6 | $79.3 |

| **FCFF** | **$270.1** | **$279.9** | **$289.8** | **$300.0** | **$310.7** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
| Component | Value/Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk-Free Rate** | **4.25%.** 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield as of August 2025. | (Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury) |
| **Equity Risk Premium** | **5.0%.** Standard market premium for a mature market. | (Source: Duff & Phelps) |
| **Beta** | **0.95.** Reflects a company with slightly less volatility than the overall market. | (Source: Yahoo Finance) |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | **9.0%.** 4.25% + 0.95 * 5.0% | (Calculated) |
| **Cost of Debt** | **5.5%.** Based on interest expense / average debt and current market conditions. | (Calculated from Q2 2025 10-Q and 2024 10-K). |
| **Tax Rate for WACC** | **28.7%.** | (Calculated from Q2 2025 10-Q and 2024 10-K). |
| **After-Tax Cost of Debt** | **3.9%.** 5.5% * (1 - 28.7%) | (Calculated) |

| **Debt Market Value** | **$116.2M** | (Q2 2025 10-Q, June 30, 2025). |
| **WACC** | **8.8%.** | (Calculated) |

### **F) Terminal Value**
The Gordon Growth Model is used to calculate the terminal value, with a conservative terminal growth rate (`g`) of 2.5%, reflecting long-run inflation expectations.

**Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
Terminal Value = ($310.7M * (1 + 2.5%)) / (8.8% - 2.5%) = $5,035M

**Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $446.1M + $79.3M = $525.4M
*   Implied Exit Multiple = Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA = $5,035M / $525.4M = 9.6x
This is in line with the company's historical median multiple.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| (in millions USD) | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Explicit FCFF (Y1-5)** | $1,194 |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | $3,312 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$4,506** |
| Less: Total Debt | -$116.2. |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents | +$135.3. |
| **Equity Value** | **$4,525.1** |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding**
*   $4,525.1M / 149.8M = **$30.21**

| Case | Assumptions | Fair Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | 3.5% revenue growth, 24.2% EBIT margin | **$30.21** |
| **Low/Bear Case** | 2.5% revenue growth, 23.5% EBIT margin | **$26.50** |
| **High/Bull Case** | 4.5% revenue growth, 25.0% EBIT margin | **$34.75** |
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% discount):** $30.21 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$21.15**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company operates in highly regulated markets (Mexico and Peru), and changes in government policies or educational standards could adversely affect operations.
2.  **Foreign Exchange Risk:** As a U.S.-based company with all operations in Mexico and Peru, LAUR is exposed to significant currency fluctuations, which can impact reported earnings.
