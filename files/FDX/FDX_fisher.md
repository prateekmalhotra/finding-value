Synthesis:
FedEx scores well on many of Fisher's 15 points, particularly in areas related to its market position, financial strength, and long-term outlook. The company's strong brand, extensive global network, and commitment to innovation are key strengths. However, the company faces challenges in a few areas, such as its labor relations and its communication with investors. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of its DRIVE transformation program and a resolution to the ongoing labor negotiations. A successful implementation of the DRIVE program would improve margins and profitability, while a positive outcome in the labor negotiations would improve employee relations and reduce the risk of a strike. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" if the company provided more transparency on its R&D spending and the returns it is generating from its investments in innovation. Similarly, a more consistent and transparent communication strategy, especially during challenging periods, could flip the "No" on candor with investors to a "Yes."

fisher score is 12 / 15
