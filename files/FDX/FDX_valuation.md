I will now begin the intrinsic value analysis for FedEx Corporation (FDX).

### A) BASELINE FINANCIALS (TTM)

First, I need to gather the trailing twelve months (TTM) financial data. I will start by searching for the latest FedEx 10-K and 10-Q reports to construct this.The search results point to the latest 10-K for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2025. I will use the URLs provided in the prompt to browse the 10-K and the latest 10-Q to gather the necessary data. I will use the provided 10-K URL `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1048911/000104891125000011/fdx-20250531.htm`, which I will assume is correct. The TTM period will be for the twelve months ending May 31, 2025.

After reviewing the 10-K, I have extracted the necessary financial data for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2025.

### B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION

I will now browse for the latest earnings call transcript to extract management's guidance.
Based on the available information from the provided URL, the latest earnings call transcript is for Q4 2025. I will now retrieve this transcript.
I am unable to access the specific transcript. However, I can proceed by using the "Outlook" section of the 2025 10-K, which provides a summary of management's expectations.

*   **Revenue:** "we expect the industrial economy to continue pressuring demand for our higher-yielding business-to-business services in the near term, and service mix to continue shifting further toward deferred service offerings. We will continue to execute on our revenue quality strategy to mitigate yield pressures through surcharge management and optimizing our customer and service mix." (FedEx Corporation 2025 Form 10-K, July 21, 2025, p. 53)
*   **Cost Savings:** "we expect to see an incremental $1 billion in structural cost reduction benefits from DRIVE and Network 2.0 in 2026, as we continue to align our cost base with demand and increase the flexibility of our network." (FedEx Corporation 2025 Form 10-K, July 21, 2025, p. 53)
*   **Capital Expenditures:** "Our capital expenditures for 2026 are expected to be approximately $4.5 billion" (FedEx Corporation 2025 Form 10-K, July 21, 2025, p. 53)
*   **USPS Contract Expiration:** "We expect the unfavorable impact of the expiration of the contract for Federal Express to provide the USPS domestic transportation services in September 2024 to continue through September 2025." (FedEx Corporation 2025 Form 10-K, July 21, 2025, p. 53)

### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

I will now establish the assumptions for the 5-year forecast.

*   **Revenue Growth:** Management guidance is qualitative, pointing to pressure on higher-yielding services. Given the lack of a specific growth rate, I will use a conservative estimate. The 2025 revenue was flat year-over-year. I will assume a modest 1.5% annual growth rate for the next five years, reflecting slight economic growth and the company's revenue quality initiatives, offset by the continued shift to deferred services.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin is 5.9% (5,217M / 87,926M). Management is targeting significant cost reductions through its DRIVE initiatives. I will assume the operating margin expands by 50 basis points in Year 1 (to 6.4%) and then remains stable, as ongoing cost savings are offset by inflationary pressures and a shifting service mix.
*   **Taxes:** The effective tax rate for FY2025 was 24.8%. The 10-K notes various one-time items. The average of the last two years (24.8% and 25.8%) is 25.3%. I will use a normalized tax rate of **25.0%** for the forecast period.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Management guided to $4.5 billion for FY2026. This represents 5.1% of FY2025 revenue. I will hold capex at 5.1% of revenue for the forecast period, consistent with this guidance.
*   **Change in Working Capital:** The change in working capital can be volatile. Historically, it has been a use of cash. I will model the change in working capital as a percentage of the *change* in revenue. Over the last two years, the average has been volatile. I will assume a conservative **10% of incremental revenue**, meaning for every dollar of new revenue, ten cents will be invested in working capital.

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

I will now construct the Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) for the 5-year forecast horizon.

**Formula:**
FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in NWC

(USD in Millions)
| | Year 1 (FY26) | Year 2 (FY27) | Year 3 (FY28) | Year 4 (FY29) | Year 5 (FY30) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | **$89,245** | **$90,583** | **$91,942** | **$93,321** | **$94,721** |
| *Revenue Growth* | *1.5%* | *1.5%* | *1.5%* | *1.5%* | *1.5%* |
| **EBIT** | **$5,712** | **$5,797** | **$5,884** | **$5,972** | **$6,062** |
| *Operating Margin* | *6.4%* | *6.4%* | *6.4%* | *6.4%* | *6.4%* |
| Tax on EBIT (25.0%) | ($1,428) | ($1,449) | ($1,471) | ($1,493) | ($1,516) |
| **NOPAT** | **$4,284** | **$4,348** | **$4,413** | **$4,479** | **$4,547** |
| Add: D&A | $4,307 | $4,348 | $4,390 | $4,433 | $4,476 |
| Less: Stock-Based Comp | ($156) | ($158) | ($161) | ($163) | ($166) |
| Less: Capex | ($4,551) | ($4,619) | ($4,688) | ($4,759) | ($4,831) |
| Less: Change in NWC | ($132) | ($134) | ($136) | ($138) | ($140) |
| **FCFF** | **$3,751** | **$3,784** | **$3,818** | **$3,852** | **$3,887** |

*Note: D&A and SBC are projected as a percentage of revenue, consistent with historical levels.*

FCFF is used for valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

I will now calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC). First, I need to find the current 10-year Treasury yield, FDX's beta, and its current stock price.Here are the components for the WACC calculation:

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate (Rf):** The 10-Year Treasury Yield is **4.30%** (YCharts, August 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** I will use a standard market premium of **5.0%**, which is within the requested 4.5%-5.5% range.
    *   **Beta (β):** StockAnalysis reports a 5-year beta of **1.31**. This beta reflects the company's higher-than-average sensitivity to market movements, which is appropriate for a cyclical, economically sensitive business like global logistics.
    *   **Cost of Equity (Ke) = Rf + β * ERP** = 4.30% + 1.31 * 5.0% = **10.85%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-tax Cost of Debt (Kd):** Interest Expense / Total Debt = $789M / $20,579M = **3.83%**.
    *   **After-tax Cost of Debt = Kd * (1 - Tax Rate)** = 3.83% * (1 - 0.25) = **2.87%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** The stock price is approximately $227.26 (The Motley Fool, August 21, 2025). E = $227.26 * 243M shares = **$55,224 million**.
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** Book value of total debt = **$20,579 million**.
    *   **Total Capital (V) = E + D** = $55,224M + $20,579M = **$75,803 million**.
    *   **WACC = (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-T))**
    *   WACC = (55,224/75,803 * 10.85%) + (20,579/75,803 * 2.87%)
    *   WACC = (0.728 * 10.85%) + (0.272 * 2.87%)
    *   WACC = 7.90% + 0.78% = **8.68%**

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

I will use the Gordon Growth Model to calculate the terminal value.

*   **Terminal FCFF (FCFF_yr5):** $3,887 million
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** I will use a terminal growth rate of **2.5%**, which is in line with long-run inflation expectations and is a sustainable long-term growth rate for a mature company.
*   **WACC:** 8.68%
*   **Terminal Value = [FCFF_yr5 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)**
*   Terminal Value = [$3,887 * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.0868 - 0.025)
*   Terminal Value = $3,984 / 0.0618 = **$64,466 million**

**Cross-Check with Exit Multiple:**
*   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT_yr5 ($6,062M) + D&A_yr5 ($4,476M) = **$10,538 million**.
*   **Historical EV/EBITDA Multiple:** I will search for historical multiples.The 5-year median EV/EBITDA is **8.4x** (Finbox, August 21, 2025).
*   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = EBITDA_yr5 * Exit Multiple**
*   Terminal Value = $10,538M * 8.4 = **$88,519 million**

The Gordon Growth terminal value ($64,466M) is significantly lower than the Exit Multiple terminal value ($88,519M). As instructed, I will use the **lower of the two**, which is the Gordon Growth value.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

I will now calculate the Enterprise Value and bridge it to the Equity Value.

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:**
    *   PV = [3751/(1.0868)^1] + [3784/(1.0868)^2] + [3818/(1.0868)^3] + [3852/(1.0868)^4] + [3887/(1.0868)^5]
    *   PV = 3451 + 3204 + 2975 + 2764 + 2568 = **$14,962 million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:**
    *   PV = $64,466 / (1.0868)^5 = **$42,525 million**
*   **Enterprise Value = PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value**
    *   Enterprise Value = $14,962M + $42,525M = **$57,487 million**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $20,579M - $5,502M = **$15,077 million** (FedEx Corporation 2025 Form 10-K, July 21, 2025, p. 73, 89)
    *   Equity Value = $57,487M - $15,077M = **$42,410 million**

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares**
    *   Base-Case Fair Value = $42,410M / 243M = **$174.53 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Assume 0% revenue growth and a 5.4% operating margin (50 bps compression from TTM). This results in a fair value of approximately **$135 per share**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Assume 3.0% revenue growth and a 6.9% operating margin (50 bps additional expansion vs. base case). This results in a fair value of approximately **$225 per share**.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Using a 30% discount to the base case: $174.53 * (1 - 0.30) = **$122.17**

**Risk Notes**
The valuation is subject to several key risks. First, the transportation industry is highly sensitive to the global macroeconomic environment; a recession would negatively impact volumes and profitability. Second, failure to realize the full $1 billion in projected cost savings from the DRIVE and Network 2.0 initiatives would result in lower margins and cash flow. Third, intense competition from UPS, Amazon, and regional carriers could pressure pricing and yields, limiting revenue growth. Fourth, volatility in fuel prices, if not fully offset by surcharges, could impact margins. Finally, challenges in labor relations, particularly with pilots, could lead to operational disruptions and increased costs.

final answer is 174.53 $
