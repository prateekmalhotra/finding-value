### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Airbnb's primary competitive advantage lies in its strong brand and the network effects of its platform.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has been involved in disputes with tax authorities, notably in Italy, which resulted in a significant settlement. Additionally, the IRS has issued a Notice of Deficiency for $1.3 billion plus penalties and interest related to the valuation of international intellectual property from 2013, which the company is contesting. While the company is vigorously defending its position and has not admitted liability in the Italian case, these significant and costly tax disputes raise questions.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Airbnb scores well on most of Fisher's points, demonstrating a strong market position, a commitment to growth and innovation, and robust financial health. Its powerful brand and network effects create a significant competitive moat. The company's long-term focus and experienced, stable management team are also key positives. The primary area of concern is the "Unquestionable Integrity" point, stemming from significant and ongoing disputes with tax authorities in multiple jurisdictions. While the company is defending its positions, the scale of these issues casts a shadow. Over the next 12–24 months, the score could be most impacted by the resolution of the IRS dispute. A favorable outcome could flip the "No" to a "Yes," while a significant negative judgment would reinforce the current assessment. Additionally, the success of its expansion into new offerings beyond its core stays business will be a key variable to watch.

fisher score is 14 / 15
