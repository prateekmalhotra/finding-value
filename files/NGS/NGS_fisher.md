Company: Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. (NGS)
Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024 (filed March 17, 2025), Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025 (filed May 12, 2025), and a listing of recent earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Natural Gas Services Group's primary business is renting natural gas compressor units, with a strategic focus on large horsepower units used in crude oil production for artificial lift applications. The company's 2024 10-K report notes a favorable outlook for crude oil production, which drives demand for its larger, higher-margin rental fleet. Rental revenue grew 15.3% in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the prior-year period, driven by a 10.9% increase in rented horsepower, underscoring the sustained demand for its services. The company believes the market outlook for natural gas production also remains steady, supporting its smaller and medium horsepower units.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a clear commitment to evolving its business model to align with market demand. The company is executing a "deliberate and strategic shift" by focusing investment on large horsepower rental units (400 horsepower or greater) and moving away from in-house fabrication towards third-party assemblers to improve efficiency. This is evidenced by significant capital expenditures, with $19.3 million invested in rental equipment and other property in the first quarter of 2025 alone. This strategy directly targets the higher-margin, growing segment of the market (crude oil artificial lift), indicating a focus on long-term sales potential.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000065/ngs-20250331.htm' (May 12, 2025)], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company does not disclose specific R&D expenditures, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, its 2024 10-K filing highlights "technical innovations" that improve performance and reduce environmental impact as a key competitive strength. These include proprietary "eComp" technology for vent capture and "System Management and Recovery Technology (SMART)" to reduce unplanned shutdowns. The focus on innovations that address increasing environmental regulations, such as the Methane Emissions Reduction Program, suggests that its development efforts are effective and aligned with industry trends.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NGS emphasizes its long-standing relationships with major and independent oil and gas companies as a competitive strength. A significant indicator of its sales effectiveness is the relationship with its largest customer, Occidental Permian, LTD. ("Oxy"), which accounted for 54% of revenue in 2024. While this represents a concentration risk, it also demonstrates the ability to secure and maintain a large-scale partnership with an industry leader. The company states its sales and marketing strategy is focused on direct contact and technical assistance, which appears effective in building and retaining its customer base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's profit margins are strong and improving, particularly in its core rental business. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the rental adjusted gross margin percentage was 61.9%, up from 61.1% in the same period of 2024. For the full year 2024, the rental adjusted gross margin was 60.5%, a significant increase from 54.0% in 2023. This trend reflects the successful strategic shift toward higher-margin, large horsepower units. Overall operating income was $9.5 million in Q1 2025, a 22.8% margin on total revenues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000065/ngs-20250331.htm' (May 12, 2025)], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NGS is actively working to improve margins through several initiatives. The core strategy is shifting its fleet mix toward larger horsepower units, which command higher rental rates and margins. The company also seeks to "Optimize existing utilized fleet" through "targeted price increases" and operational efficiencies gained from improved data analysis to manage costs. Furthermore, NGS is de-emphasizing lower-margin sales of new compressor packages and has transitioned away from in-house fabrication, closing its Midland fabrication facility in April 2025 to streamline its cost structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states that it had 245 employees as of December 31, 2024, none of whom are represented by a labor union. The filing explicitly states, "We believe that we have good relations with our employees." Disclosures on human capital mention competitive compensation and benefits programs, including a 401(k) with employer matching, comprehensive insurance, and incentive plans. There are no reports of labor disputes or significant employee-related issues in the reviewed filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000065/ngs-20250331.htm' (May 12, 2025)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been recent turnover at the highest level, with a new CEO, Justin C. Jacobs, appointed in early 2024. The 2024 10-K also notes restructuring charges in 2023 and 2022 related to a transition in executive leadership. While leadership changes are not inherently negative, recent and significant turnover prevents a clear "Yes" based on a track record of stability. The current executive team is small, consisting of a CEO, President/COO, and CFO.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's public filings identify a lean executive management team of three officers: the Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Operating Officer, and Chief Financial Officer. While these individuals may be highly capable, the available documents do not provide significant detail on the next layer of operational management or formal succession planning. This lean structure could present a key-person risk if one or more executives were to depart.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Ham, Langston & Brezina LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Notably, management successfully remediated a material weakness related to inventory controls that was identified in the prior year. This remediation demonstrates a commitment to maintaining and improving accounting controls. The financial statements provide a clear breakdown of revenues and costs by segment (Rental, Sales, Aftermarket), indicating adequate cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000065/ngs-20250331.htm' (May 12, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the compressor industry is equipment reliability, measured by mechanical availability. NGS states that it delivers "very high levels of mechanical availability," which provides "material incremental profitability to customers" and serves as a "competitive differentiator." Additionally, the company has developed proprietary technologies like "eComp" and "SMART" to reduce emissions and unplanned shutdowns. This focus on both operational uptime and environmental performance is a significant clue to its competitive standing, especially as regulations on emissions tighten.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. The company is investing heavily in its rental fleet, particularly large horsepower units that are often deployed under multi-year contracts, prioritizing durable, recurring revenue over the more volatile, short-term profits from equipment sales. Capital expenditures were $71.9 million in 2024 for new equipment. This willingness to deploy significant capital into long-lived assets that generate recurring revenue for many years is a clear indication of a long-range profit focus. The transcripts also emphasize a disciplined growth strategy focused on returns.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/NGS/transcripts/' (August 20, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's growth is primarily funded through operating cash flow and debt, not equity issuance. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $168.0 million outstanding on its credit facility and recently expanded the total commitment to $400 million, with an option to increase it to $500 million. Net cash provided by operating activities was a strong $21.3 million for the first quarter of 2025. This substantial liquidity from debt capacity and internal cash generation appears sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures without needing to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000065/ngs-20250331.htm' (May 12, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's disclosures appear candid. The 2024 10-K openly discusses significant risks, such as its heavy reliance on a single customer (Oxy). Furthermore, management transparently disclosed a material weakness in its internal controls in its 2023 report and detailed the successful remediation efforts in the 2024 report, which shows accountability. The availability of regular quarterly earnings call transcripts allows for direct engagement with analysts, providing a platform for open discussion of both positive results and challenges.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)], ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/NGS/transcripts/' (August 20, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's recent SEC filings reveals no significant red flags regarding management integrity. The 2024 10-K states that the company is not a party to any material legal proceedings. Related-party transactions are disclosed and do not appear problematic. The company has an established Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and the board has standard audit and governance committees. The proactive remediation of the previously disclosed material weakness also reflects a commitment to good governance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084991/000108499125000024/ngs-20241231.htm' (March 17, 2025)]

---
**Synthesis:**
Natural Gas Services Group, Inc. scores well against Fisher's checklist, demonstrating a clear strategic focus, strong and improving margins in its core rental business, and a solid financial position that does not rely on dilutive equity financing. Key strengths are its commitment to aligning with the profitable, long-runway market of large-horsepower compression for oil production, its innovative and reliable equipment, and its transparent investor communications. The primary weaknesses identified are related to management, specifically a lack of demonstrated stability at the executive level and a perceived lack of management depth beyond the top three officers. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the performance and stability of the new executive team; establishing a track record of execution and potentially highlighting a deeper bench of operational leaders would flip the "No" answers to "Yes." Another key variable is the company's ability to diversify its customer base to mitigate the concentration risk associated with its largest client.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
