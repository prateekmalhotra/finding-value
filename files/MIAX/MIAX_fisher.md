### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX has expanded from a single options exchange to a global exchange group with a diverse portfolio. This includes four U.S. options exchanges, a U.S. equities exchange, a futures exchange, and international exchanges like the Bermuda Stock Exchange (BSX) and The International Stock Exchange (TISE). The recent IPO in August 2025 was priced above the expected range, suggesting strong market confidence in its growth prospects. This diversified product base across different asset classes and geographies provides a long runway for growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX has demonstrated a commitment to ongoing development through both organic growth and acquisitions. The company has grown from a single options exchange to a global group. It has built its trading platforms on proprietary, in-house technology, and is launching MIAX Sapphire, its fourth U.S. options exchange, with a new market model and trading floor coming in 2025. The acquisitions of the Bermuda Stock Exchange and The International Stock Exchange show a clear strategy of expanding into new international markets and asset classes.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX emphasizes its technology-driven approach, with "in-house built, proprietary technology" as a key differentiator. The company's trading platform was specifically designed to handle the high-performance demands of the U.S. options market. While specific R&D expenditure figures are not available in the provided search results, the successful launch and operation of multiple exchanges on its proprietary technology suggest an effective R&D function.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's history of expansion, from a single exchange to a global group, and its continued investment in new exchanges like MIAX Sapphire, suggests a focus on long-term growth. The acquisitions of international exchanges also point to a long-range strategy. However, without management commentary from earnings calls or investor presentations, it is difficult to definitively assess their outlook on profits.
**Answer:** No

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX just completed its IPO in August 2025, raising a significant amount of capital. This recent infusion of cash should provide the company with the necessary funds for its near-term growth plans. However, without a balance sheet and cash flow statement, a full assessment of its financial position is not possible.

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a newly public company, MIAX has a limited track record of communication with investors. While they have an investor relations website with news and SEC filings, there is no history of earnings calls or investor presentations to assess their level of candor.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**

Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX) shows promise based on its diversified product portfolio and commitment to technological innovation, which are strong positives. The recent IPO provides the capital for near-term growth initiatives. However, the analysis is severely limited by the lack of publicly available financial data and a track record as a public company. The Fisher score will likely change significantly in the next 12-24 months as MIAX begins to report quarterly earnings and provide more detailed financial disclosures. The key variables to watch are the company's ability to generate profitable growth, its R&D effectiveness, and the transparency of its management team in communicating with investors. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" for many of the points with the publication of a comprehensive 10-K report and a few quarters of earnings calls.

**fisher score is 3 / 15**
