Wix.com Ltd. (WIX), analysis date August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 20-F (FY2024, filed March 21, 2025), Q2 2025 Earnings Release (August 6, 2025), and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (August 17, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix is expanding its Total Addressable Market (TAM) beyond its core website building business. The recent acquisition of Base44 moves the company into the application development space, a significant growth area. The company is experiencing strong underlying momentum, with new user cohort bookings growing 14% year-over-year in Q2 2025 and its Partners revenue growing 24% y/y. Management has expressed confidence that AI-driven products and the Base44 acquisition will support "robust growth in 2026 and beyond."
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix has demonstrated a strong commitment to new product development, particularly in AI and for professional users. In early 2025, management highlighted the planned launch of two "transformative products" aimed at reinvigorating growth in the Self Creator segment. The acquisition of Base44 is a major strategic investment to enter the application development market. The CEO stated in the Q2 2025 earnings call that the company is making "incremental ongoing AI marketing and headcount investments" to integrate and grow this new acquisition, signaling a clear focus on future growth engines.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix's R&D expenses were a significant portion of its revenue, running at 29% of revenue for the full year 2024, as detailed in its 20-F filing. This investment has yielded tangible results, such as the Wix Studio platform for professionals, which management credits for driving a 24% y/y growth in Partners revenue in Q2 2025. The company continuously integrates AI features and has acquired new capabilities like Base44, demonstrating that its R&D spending translates into market-expanding product launches.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html) (August 6, 2025), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-y2VE12ASc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-y2VE12ASc) (August 17, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix primarily relies on a self-service, online-first model, converting free users to paid subscriptions, which differs from a traditional sales organization. While effective, the company is now building out its partner and enterprise sales motions. The Partners segment revenue grew an impressive 24% y/y to $183.3 million in Q2 2025, showing strong traction with agencies and professionals. However, detailed metrics on sales productivity, win rates, or pipeline common for enterprise software companies are not consistently disclosed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html) (August 6, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix has demonstrated significant profitability. For the full year 2024, the company reported a GAAP operating loss, but on a non-GAAP basis, which excludes items like stock-based compensation, its operating income was $214.1 million, or 12% of revenue. More importantly, the company generated $363.3 million in free cash flow (FCF) in 2024, a margin of 21%. The company's updated guidance for 2025 projects FCF to be between $595 and $610 million, representing a very strong FCF margin of 30-31% of revenue.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html) (August 6, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on expanding margins as part of its three-year financial plan introduced in August 2023. The plan targets increasing free cash flow margins and achieving GAAP profitability, which it did in some quarters. A key driver of margin improvement is operating leverage, as revenue growth outpaces hiring and marketing spend. The company is also focused on the growth of higher-margin Business Solutions revenue and has shown discipline in managing operating expenses to drive profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 20-F filing, Wix states, "We believe our relations with our employees are good," and notes that it is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements. The company had approximately 5,000 employees as of December 31, 2024. However, there is a lack of specific, publicly available data on employee turnover rates, engagement survey results, or other quantitative metrics to independently verify that relations are "outstanding" beyond standard corporate disclosures.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior leadership team at Wix includes its co-founders, Avishai Abrahami (CEO) and Nadav Abrahami (President), which suggests a stable, long-term vision at the top. The management team has been consistent through the company's major growth phases and its recent pivot towards profitability. There are no reports of significant executive infighting or departures in recent filings or transcripts. This stability is a positive indicator of solid executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix's leadership team is heavily centered around its co-founders, particularly CEO Avishai Abrahami, who is central to the company's product vision and strategy. While the company lists other key executives like the CFO and COO, public documents and conference calls provide limited visibility into the next layer of management or formal succession planning. The high prominence of the co-founders presents a potential key-person risk, and there is insufficient evidence to confirm robust management depth beyond the top tier.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix's financial statements are audited by Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer, a member of Ernst & Young Global, which issued an unqualified opinion for the fiscal year 2024. The 20-F filing contains a statement on management's responsibility for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, with no material weaknesses identified. The company provides segment reporting for "Creative Subscriptions" and "Business Solutions," offering a reasonable level of cost and revenue granularity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the SaaS website development industry, a key competitive advantage is ecosystem lock-in and network effects. Wix has built a strong ecosystem with its App Market, payment processing (Wix Payments), and specialized tools for specific verticals (e.g., restaurants, bookings). The introduction of Wix Studio for professionals creates a sticky platform, as agencies build their workflows and client sites on Wix, making it harder to switch. This platform-based approach, which combines ease of use for self-creators with powerful tools for professionals, is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html) (August 6, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Historically, Wix prioritized growth over profits for many years, investing heavily in R&D and marketing to acquire users. The "Three-Year Plan" announced in 2023 signaled a strategic shift to balance growth with profitability. The recent acquisition of Base44 and related investments in AI and marketing, which are expected to slightly increase operating expenses in 2025, show a continued willingness to invest for long-term growth, even if it modestly impacts near-term margins. Management is pursuing both growth and profitability, reflecting a balanced, long-range view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html) (August 6, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix's financial position is strong, obviating the need for dilutive equity financing. The company held over $1 billion in cash and short-term investments as of June 30, 2025, and is generating substantial free cash flow, with a 2025 forecast of nearly $600 million. Furthermore, the company has an active share repurchase program, authorizing $400 million in buybacks. In Q2 2025, it repurchased nearly $100 million of its own shares, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/08/06/3128017/0/en/Wix-Reports-Second-Quarter-2025-Results.html) (August 6, 2025), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-y2VE12ASc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-y2VE12ASc) (August 17, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wix management maintains a regular cadence of communication through quarterly shareholder letters, earnings calls, and participation in investor conferences. The shareholder letters provide detailed KPIs and explain the drivers of performance. While the company has not faced a major crisis recently, the shift in strategy in 2023 to focus on profitability was communicated clearly and has been a consistent theme in all subsequent investor communications, suggesting a good level of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://investors.wix.com/](https://investors.wix.com/) (August 24, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of Wix's recent SEC filings and press releases reveals no significant legal proceedings, regulatory actions, or accounting scandals that would call into question the integrity of the senior management team. The 20-F details standard risk factors and related-party transactions, but nothing appears out of the ordinary for a publicly-traded technology company. The company's financials are audited by a major accounting firm, and there are no reported governance red flags.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1576789/000119312525076734/d888880d20f.htm) (March 21, 2025)

**Synthesis:**
Wix scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly regarding its forward-looking strategy, financial strength, and commitment to innovation. The company's strongest attributes are its expanding market opportunity through new products like Studio and the Base44 acquisition, its effective R&D engine, and its robust and growing free cash flow margins. This financial strength allows Wix to invest in growth while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders, a powerful combination. The primary weaknesses identified are not related to poor performance but rather a lack of specific disclosures that would confirm "outstanding" status in areas like labor relations, sales organization metrics, and management depth beyond the highly-regarded co-founders. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on the execution of the Base44 integration and its contribution to revenue, and the market reception of the two new "transformative" products for Self Creators. Flipping the "No" on the sales organization would require more detailed disclosures on enterprise win rates and partner productivity.

fisher score is 12 / 15
