**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Las Vegas Sands has a long-term focus and is willing to make investments that may not pay off for several years. For example, the company is investing billions of dollars in its Macao and Singapore properties, which will not generate a significant return on investment for several years. This willingness to invest for the long term is a key reason for the company's success.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1300514/000130051425000144/lvs-20250630.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Las Vegas Sands has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow. The company has over $10 billion in cash and marketable securities and its debt-to-equity ratio is below the industry average. This gives the company the financial flexibility to fund its growth plans without having to issue new equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1300514/000130051425000144/lvs-20250630.htm']

In summary, Las Vegas Sands is a high-quality company with a strong competitive position in the global gaming industry. The company's focus on high-growth markets, its disciplined capital allocation, and its experienced management team are all key strengths. However, the company's reliance on the Macao market and its history of legal and regulatory issues are key risks. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are a significant change in the regulatory environment in Macao, a major new development project in a new jurisdiction, or a change in the company's capital allocation strategy.
