### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Increased Share Repurchase Authorization and Activity
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description:** On September 4, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $100.0 million for the Company's share repurchase program. As of April 30, 2025, there was $104.6 million remaining under the repurchase authority.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects and can be a tax-efficient way to return capital to shareholders.
*   **Timing:** The repurchase program has no expiration date and may be implemented from time to time.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company repurchases $50 million worth of shares.
    *   **Base Case:** The company repurchases $100 million worth of shares.
    *   **High Case:** The company repurchases the full authorized amount of $104.6 million.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small to Medium (5-15%)
*   **Probability / Confidence:** 85%
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price must be considered undervalued by management for the repurchases to be accretive.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q and 10-K filings.
    *   Announcements of any new or expanded repurchase authorizations.
    *   Changes in the number of outstanding shares.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   The company may choose to use its cash for other purposes, such as acquisitions or debt repayment.
    *   The market may not react positively to the repurchases if they are seen as a sign of slowing growth.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch

**2. Catalyst Title:** Accretive European Acquisitions
*   **Type:** M&A

*   **Mechanism:** The acquisition of Gravotech is expected to expand Brady's product offerings and R&D capabilities. If integrated successfully, the acquisition can be accretive to earnings, leading to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Near-Term (0-12 months)
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The acquisition is only marginally accretive to earnings.
    *   **Base Case:** The acquisition is moderately accretive to earnings, adding 5-10% to EPS.
    *   **High Case:** The acquisition is highly accretive to earnings, adding over 10% to EPS.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%)
*   **Probability / Confidence:** 70%
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful integration of Gravotech's operations and realization of synergies.

    *   Current Shares Outstanding: 47.3M
    *   Current P/E: 15x
    *   Repurchase Amount: $100M
*   **Calculation:**
    *   New Shares Outstanding = 47.3M - ($100M / $63.40) = 45.7M

    *   New EPS = $216.9M / 47.3M = $4.59
    *   New Stock Price = $4.59 \* 15 = $68.85
