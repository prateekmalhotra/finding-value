### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** ABM's business model as a facility services provider does not exhibit network effects. The value of its service to a customer does not increase as more customers join. The business scales linearly with the addition of new clients, rather than creating a virtuous cycle of value.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business is described as a "provider of integrated facility, infrastructure, and mobility solutions," with growth driven by acquiring new service contracts, not by user base expansion creating interconnectivity. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Switching costs are moderate, arising from the operational disruption and management effort required to change an integrated facilities provider. While contracts are often cancelable on short notice (30-90 days), the logistical challenge of vetting, hiring, and onboarding a new vendor for multiple services (janitorial, engineering, parking) across numerous sites creates customer inertia and preserves relationships. The company notes that its "ability to preserve long-term client relationships is essential to our continued success." (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Evidence:**
*   "Although many of our service agreements are cancelable on short notice, we have historically had a high rate of client retention and expect to continue maintaining long-term relationships with our clients." (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
*   The majority of contracts "have a notification period of 30 to 90 days." (Form 10-Q, March 12, 2025).
*   The business model is built on providing integrated services, which increases the complexity for a client to switch compared to a single-service provider. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** ABM likely possesses a modest cost advantage derived from its scale, particularly in purchasing supplies and insurance. However, with direct labor costs representing 68% of total revenue, these scale benefits are limited in scope, as labor is predominantly sourced locally and subject to prevailing market and union rates. Competition is high from regional and local firms with lower overhead, which compresses margins and limits the durability of any cost leadership.
**Evidence:**
*   "Direct labor costs represented 68% of our total revenue for 2024." (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
*   "We compete mainly with regional and local owner-operated companies that may have more acute vision into local markets and significantly lower labor and overhead costs." (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
*   Gross margin for the three months ended January 31, 2025 was 12.3%, indicating a high pass-through of costs and a competitive pricing environment. (Form 10-Q, March 12, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** ABM has established brand recognition in the facility services industry over its long history, which aids in securing large, complex contracts. It holds trademarks for its service lines like "Linc Service" and "TEGG," but these do not confer significant pricing power. The business does not rely on patents or exclusive intellectual property for its core services.
**Evidence:**
*   The company holds various service marks and trade names, such as “ABM,” “Linc Service,” and “TEGG,” which it deems important to its marketing activities. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
*   Competition is based "primarily on price, quality of service, efficiency, and productivity enhancements," not on brand-driven price premiums. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** ABM's dense operational footprint across the United States and presence in the UK provides an advantage in serving clients with national or international portfolios. This scale allows for efficient allocation of management and resources, making it one of a limited number of providers capable of handling large, multi-site contracts. This creates a barrier to entry for smaller firms to compete for the largest national accounts.
**Evidence:**
*   ABM operates across the United States, UK, and Ireland, serving over 20,000 clients, indicating a broad and dense network. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
*   The company's industry-based, go-to-market approach leverages its scale to provide specialized services across large geographic areas. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** ABM's business is not data-driven in a way that creates a competitive moat. While the company is investing in technology and data analytics as part of its ELEVATE strategy to improve efficiency, it does not possess unique, proprietary datasets that generate a network effect or a significant product advantage that locks in customers.
**Evidence:**
*   The ELEVATE strategy aims to use "technology and data to power client and employee experiences," but this is framed as an internal efficiency and service improvement tool, not a unique, monetizable data asset. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** ABM has a minor ecosystem through its franchising of certain engineering services under the Linc Service and TEGG brands. This creates a small network of third-party operators that utilize ABM's methods and brand. However, this is a very small part of the overall business and does not create a powerful platform that draws in a significant number of third-party developers or complementary services that enhance the core offering.
**Evidence:**
*   "We franchise certain engineering services through individual and area franchises under the Linc Service and TEGG brands, which are part of ABM Technical Solutions." (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The facility services industry has low regulatory barriers to entry. While ABM must comply with numerous labor, safety, and environmental regulations, these apply to all competitors and do not grant ABM an exclusive right to operate. The company does not hold any critical, hard-to-replicate licenses or government-granted monopolies.
**Evidence:**
*   The "low cost of entry in the facility services business results in a very competitive market." (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
*   The company is subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, but these are described as costs of compliance rather than competitive advantages. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** The core business of janitorial and facility services is not capital intensive, which contributes to the low barriers to entry. However, specialized equipment for certain technical services and the scale of its vehicle fleet and machinery create some capital hurdles. These assets are generally not highly specific and can be acquired by competitors, representing a modest but not formidable barrier.
**Evidence:**
*   Additions to property, plant and equipment were USD 59.4 million for the year ended October 31, 2024, on revenues of USD 8,359.4 million, indicating low capital intensity (approx. 0.7%). (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** Revenue has a degree of visibility due to the contractual nature of the business, but this is weakened by short contract terms. The majority of contracts are cancelable with 30-90 days' notice, limiting long-term guaranteed revenue. The company does not report a backlog or remaining performance obligation metric that would provide strong, multi-year revenue visibility.
**Evidence:**
*   "Generally, most of our contracts are cancelable by either party without a substantive penalty, and the majority have a notification period of 30 to 90 days." (Form 10-Q, March 12, 2025).
*   At January 31, 2025, remaining performance obligations that were unsatisfied totaled USD 279.4 million, with 73% expected to be recognized over the next 12 months. This is a small fraction of annual revenue. (Form 10-Q, March 12, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(0 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.45 + 0.30 + 0.24 + 0.30 + 0 + 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.06 = 1.57

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 15.7 / 100

### Mapping
The weighted score of 15.7 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range.
*   Weighted < 10 → 0
*   **10 ≤ Weighted < 30 → 1**
*   30 ≤ Weighted < 50 → 2
*   50 ≤ Weighted < 70 → 3
*   70 ≤ Weighted < 85 → 4
*   Weighted ≥ 85 → 5

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is approximately 5-7 years. The moat is primarily based on moderate switching costs and efficient scale, which are not highly durable advantages. Given that contracts are short-term and the industry is highly competitive with low barriers to entry, a persistent advantage is difficult to maintain. The primary risk is price-based competition from smaller regional players or a larger competitor seeking to gain market share.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Increased Client Price Sensitivity:** A recessionary environment could force clients to aggressively seek cost savings, prioritizing price over the convenience of an integrated provider and thus eroding switching costs. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
2.  **Labor Cost Inflation:** A significant rise in labor costs, particularly from union renegotiations (approximately 42% of employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements), that cannot be passed on to clients would erode ABM's cost structure and profitability. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).
3.  **Decline in Commercial Office Demand:** A permanent structural shift to remote or hybrid work could continue to increase office vacancy rates, reducing demand for ABM's core janitorial and engineering services in its largest segment, Business & Industry. (Form 10-K, December 19, 2024).

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Client Retention Rate:** A decrease would signal an erosion of switching costs.
*   **Gross Margin %:** Compression indicates intense price competition and an inability to pass on costs.
*   **Revenue from New Business vs. Attrition:** A sustained negative net position would indicate market share loss.
*   **Work Orders as a % of Revenue:** A decline could be a leading indicator of reduced client facility usage, especially in commercial real estate.
*   **Direct Labor Cost as a % of Revenue:** An increase would signal pressure on the company's primary cost input.
*   **Revenue per Employee:** To track labor productivity.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
ABM Industries possesses a narrow moat, primarily supported by moderate switching costs and its efficient scale, which allows it to serve large, multi-site clients effectively. However, the company operates in a highly competitive, low-barrier-to-entry industry where labor costs constitute the majority of expenses, limiting any significant or durable cost advantage. The lack of network effects, meaningful intangible assets, or regulatory barriers results in a low weighted score. The assigned rating of 1/5 reflects these limited advantages. A significant increase in long-term, multi-service contracts or a demonstrated ability to consistently achieve higher margins than peers through proprietary technology would be required to justify a higher rating.
