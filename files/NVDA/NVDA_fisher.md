### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NVIDIA's financial position is exceptionally strong. As of April 27, 2025, the company held $53.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. It generated $64.1 billion in cash from operations in fiscal year 2025. Rather than issuing shares, NVIDIA has an aggressive capital return program; in fiscal year 2025, it repurchased $34.0 billion of its common stock. This powerful free cash flow and robust balance sheet allow the company to fund its ambitious growth and R&D plans without needing to dilute shareholders through equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm (May 28, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm (February 26, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NVIDIA's public filings demonstrate a high degree of transparency regarding business risks and challenges. The Risk Factors section of its 10-K is extensive, providing specific details on competition, supply chain constraints, and the significant impact of U.S. export controls on its China business. Management openly discusses challenges such as inventory provisions for new products and supply constraints. For example, the Q1 FY2026 report detailed a $4.5 billion charge related to H20 product inventory due to new export rules. This willingness to disclose specific, negative financial impacts suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm (February 26, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000023/nvda-20250126.htm), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm (May 28, 2025)](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1045810/000104581025000116/nvda-20250427.htm)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is currently facing a shareholder lawsuit, which the Supreme Court allowed to proceed, alleging the company made misleading statements in 2017-2018 about its reliance on crypto-mining revenue. In 2022, NVIDIA paid $5.5 million to settle related SEC charges that it failed to properly disclose the impact of crypto mining on its gaming business, without admitting or denying the findings. While the company has not been found guilty of wrongdoing in the ongoing lawsuit, the SEC settlement and the persistence of these allegations prevent a clear, affirmative answer on "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

Synthesis:
NVIDIA scores highly on most of Fisher's points, reflecting its dominant market position, technological leadership, and strong financial performance. Its key strengths are a long runway for growth driven by the AI revolution, a deep competitive moat built on its CUDA software ecosystem, and a stable, visionary management team that prioritizes long-term R&D investment. The company's outstanding profit margins and robust balance sheet, which allows for significant shareholder returns, are also major positives. The primary negative factor is the ongoing securities litigation related to past disclosures, which casts a shadow on the "unquestionable integrity" of management. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the outcome of this lawsuit and the escalating geopolitical risks, particularly further U.S. export controls on China, which could impact long-term growth. A definitive legal victory for NVIDIA would flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes" and solidify a near-perfect score.

fisher score is 14 / 15
