### **B) Management Guidance Extracts**

Key guidance elements for fiscal year 2025, issued on August 6, 2025:

*   **Applebee's comparable sales:** "expected to range between positive 1% and positive 3%."
*   **IHOP comparable sales:** "expected to range between negative 1% and positive 1%."
*   **Consolidated Adjusted EBITDA:** "expected to fall around the $225 million mark."

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Rationale:** Management provides sales guidance but not consolidated revenue. Given the low single-digit expectations for same-store sales and continued net restaurant closures (per 10-Q), a minimal growth rate is appropriate. The TTM revenue of $820.9M provides a recent baseline. A flat 0.5% growth rate is assumed, reflecting slight positive performance at Applebee's offset by IHOP's flatness and overall system shrinkage.
    *   **Assumption:** **0.5% annual revenue growth** for the next 5 years.

*   **Margin Path (EBIT Margin):**
    *   **Rationale:** TTM EBIT margin is 17.9% ($147.2M / $820.9M). Given the flat to low-growth environment and inflationary pressures mentioned in filings, significant margin expansion is unlikely. We will hold the TTM margin stable.
    *   **Assumption:** **17.9% EBIT Margin** held constant.

*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Rationale:** The effective tax rate in the Q1 2025 10-Q is 35.9%, and for FY 2024 it was 27.5%. The TTM effective tax rate is approximately 28.9% (($24.7M + $4.6M - $6.6M) / ($89.5M + $12.8M - $24.0M)). Normalizing for potential one-time items, we will use a slightly more conservative 28% rate.
    *   **Assumption:** Effective tax rate of **28.0%**.

*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex is $14.1M, or 1.7% of TTM revenue. The average for 2022-2024 was approximately 2.9% of revenue. Given the focus on a franchise model, we assume capex remains low.
        *   **Assumption:** Capex at **2.0% of annual revenue**.
    *   **Working Capital:** TTM Change in WC was -$6.3M. We will model Change in WC as a percentage of *incremental* revenue. Historically, the relationship is volatile. Given the low growth forecast, we assume a neutral change.
        *   **Assumption:** Change in Working Capital is **0.0% of the change in revenue**.

*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** TTM SBC is $14.5M, or 1.8% of revenue. This is treated as a cash expense.
        *   **Assumption:** SBC remains at **1.8% of annual revenue**.
    *   **Share Count:** The latest reported diluted weighted-average share count will be used for the final per-share calculation.
        *   **Assumption:** **14.9 million** diluted shares.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it is independent of capital structure and represents cash available to all capital providers.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Δ in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $825.0 | $829.1 | $833.3 | $837.4 | $841.6 |
| EBIT (17.9%) | $147.7 | $148.4 | $149.2 | $149.9 | $150.7 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 72%) | $106.3 | $106.9 | $107.4 | $107.9 | $108.5 |
| (+) D&A (assumed stable) | $50.7 | $50.7 | $50.7 | $50.7 | $50.7 |
| (-) SBC (1.8% of Rev) | ($14.9) | ($14.9) | ($15.0) | ($15.1) | ($15.1) |
| (-) Capex (2.0% of Rev) | ($16.5) | ($16.6) | ($16.7) | ($16.7) | ($16.8) |
| (-) Δ in WC | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 | $0.0 |
| **FCFF** | **$125.6** | **$126.1** | **$126.4** | **$126.8** | **$127.3** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.29%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025).
    *   Beta: **1.00** (Average of sources, reflecting market risk). This is justified as Dine Brands operates in the consumer discretionary sector, which tends to move with the broader economy.
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard market premium).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 1.00 * 5.0% = 9.29%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Rationale:** Derived from the weighted average interest rate on total debt.
    *   Debt Composition (10-Q, May 7, 2025, p. 14): $594M at 4.723%, $500M at 7.824%, $100M at ~6.93%.
    *   Weighted Avg. Interest = (594\*4.723% + 500\*7.824% + 100\*6.93%) / 1194 = 6.22%
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 6.22% \* (1 - 28.0%) = **4.48%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** WACC = (E / (E+D)) \* Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) \* Cost of Debt \* (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): 14.9M shares \* $21.65/share = $322.6M.
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $1,194.0M.
    *   Total Value (V) = E + D = $1,516.6M.
    *   Equity Weight = 322.6 / 1516.6 = 21.3%
    *   Debt Weight = 1194.0 / 1516.6 = 78.7%
    *   **WACC = (0.213 \* 9.29%) + (0.787 \* 4.48%) = 1.98% + 3.53% = 5.51%**

---

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = (FCFF\_Year5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This is a reasonable long-term inflation expectation and a sustainable rate for a mature company.
    *   **Terminal Value = ($127.3 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0551 - 0.025) = $130.5 / 0.0301 = $4,335.5M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   TTM EBITDA = TTM EBIT ($147.2M) + TTM D&A ($50.7M) = $197.9M.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($150.7M) + D&A ($50.7M) = $201.4M.
    *   Historical Median EV/EBITDA: **10.7x**.
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $201.4M \* 10.7 = **$2,155.0M**
    *   **Decision:** There is a significant discrepancy. The Exit Multiple method is more grounded in historical valuation multiples for the company. The Gordon Growth method appears overly optimistic. Therefore, the lower, more conservative **Terminal Value of $2,155.0M** is chosen.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value Calculation:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: ($125.6/1.0551^1) + ($126.1/1.0551^2) + ($126.4/1.0551^3) + ($126.8/1.0551^4) + ($127.3/1.0551^5)
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $119.0 + $113.1 + $107.6 + $102.3 + $97.3 = **$539.3M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $2,155.0M / (1.0551^5) = $1,649.3M
    *   **Enterprise Value = $539.3M + $1,649.3M = $2,188.6M**

*   **Equity Value Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($1,194.0M) - Cash ($186.5M) = $1,007.5M. (10-Q, May 7, 2025, p. 3, 14)
    *   **Equity Value = $2,188.6M - $1,007.5M = $1,181.1M**

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   **Fair Value = $1,181.1M / 14.9M shares = $79.27 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$79.27**. Assumes 0.5% revenue growth and stable 17.9% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$55.00**. Assumes -1.0% revenue decline and margin compression to 16.0%, with a lower 9.0x exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$105.00**. Assumes 2.0% revenue growth, slight margin expansion to 19.0%, and a higher 11.5x exit multiple.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **Formula:** MOS Price = Base-Case Fair Value \* (1 - MOS %)
    *   Using a **30%** MOS for a highly leveraged company in a competitive industry:
    *   **MOS Price = $79.27 \* (1 - 0.30) = $55.49**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **High Leverage:** The company's significant debt load ($1.2B total debt vs. ~$0.3B market cap) makes its equity value highly sensitive to changes in operating performance and interest rates.
2.  **Franchisee Health:** The business model is overwhelmingly reliant on the financial health and performance of its franchisees. Economic downturns or rising operating costs for franchisees directly impact Dine's royalty stream.
3.  **Competitive Industry:** The casual and family dining sectors are intensely competitive. Failure to innovate the menu, guest experience, and marketing at Applebee's and IHOP could lead to continued market share loss and weak same-store sales.
4.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** As a non-essential service, restaurant sales are vulnerable to pullbacks in consumer discretionary spending during periods of economic uncertainty or high inflation.
5.  **Brand Relevance:** Both Applebee's and IHOP are mature brands that face the constant challenge of remaining relevant to younger consumers and adapting to changing dietary and dining preferences (e.g., off-premise, delivery).

final answer is 79.27 $
