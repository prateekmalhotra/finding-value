### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Continued Share Repurchase Program Execution

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Block, Inc. has an active share repurchase program and has been actively buying back its stock. Through April 2025, the company had repurchased approximately $600 million of its stock.
*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, all else being equal, can lead to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects and can create a floor for the stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with a significant portion expected in the next 0–12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $500 million of stock, reducing the share count by approximately 1.5%.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $1 billion of stock, reducing the share count by approximately 3%.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $1.5 billion of stock, reducing the share count by approximately 4.5%.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–15%). A 3% reduction in share count, combined with the positive signal to the market, could lead to a 10-15% increase in the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has explicitly stated its intention to continue returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must continue to generate sufficient free cash flow to fund the buybacks without taking on excessive debt.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q filings.
    *   Company announcements regarding the share repurchase program.
    *   Free cash flow generation.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the company's business could reduce the cash available for buybacks.
    *   The company may choose to use its cash for acquisitions or other investments instead of buybacks.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of share repurchases and the company's free cash flow generation.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Expansion of Cash App Borrow and Banking Products

*   **Type:** Product/Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In March 2025, Block received FDIC approval to use its bank, Square Financial Services, to issue consumer loans for Cash App Borrow nationwide. This allows for a significant expansion of the company's lending capabilities.
*   **Mechanism:** The expansion of Cash App Borrow and other banking products will create new, high-margin revenue streams for the company. The ability to issue loans directly through its own bank will improve the unit economics of the lending business and allow for greater scale.
*   **Timing:** 0–12 months. The impact on gross profit is expected to be significant starting in Q3 and Q4 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The expansion of Cash App Borrow adds $100 million in incremental gross profit in the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The expansion of Cash App Borrow adds $200 million in incremental gross profit in the next 12 months.
    *   **High Scenario:** The expansion of Cash App Borrow adds $300 million in incremental gross profit in the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (15–25%). An additional $200 million in gross profit, at a 20x multiple, could add $4 billion to the company's market capitalization, representing a ~10% increase. The market may price in a higher impact due to the long-term growth potential of the lending business.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has already received FDIC approval and has a clear roadmap for the expansion.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must effectively manage the credit risk associated with the expansion of its loan portfolio.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Gross profit growth from Cash App.
    *   Loan origination volumes for Cash App Borrow.
    *   Delinquency and charge-off rates for the loan portfolio.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A deterioration in the macroeconomic environment could lead to higher-than-expected loan losses.
    *   Regulatory scrutiny of the company's lending practices could increase.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The expansion of Cash App Borrow is a significant growth driver that is not yet fully reflected in the stock price.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** International Market Penetration and Growth

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Block is focused on expanding its presence in international markets. The company's international gross payment volume growth accelerated to 25% in the second quarter of 2025.
*   **Mechanism:** International markets represent a large, untapped opportunity for Block. As the company expands its product offerings and localizes its services, it can capture a significant share of the global payments and financial services market. This will drive long-term revenue and gross profit growth.
*   **Timing:** 12–60 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** International gross profit grows at a 20% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next five years.
    *   **Base Scenario:** International gross profit grows at a 30% CAGR over the next five years.
    *   **High Scenario:** International gross profit grows at a 40% CAGR over the next five years.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). If international gross profit reaches $5 billion in five years (from a base of ~$1 billion today), at a 20x multiple, it could add $100 billion to the company's market capitalization.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a demonstrated ability to execute in international markets, but competition is intense.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must successfully navigate the unique regulatory and competitive landscapes in each international market.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   International gross payment volume growth.
    *   International gross profit growth.
    *   New market launches.
