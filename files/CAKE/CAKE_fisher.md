### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Cheesecake Factory operates multiple brands with significant growth potential. The core Cheesecake Factory brand is mature, but the company is expanding through its North Italia and Flower Child concepts.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a clear commitment to ongoing development through its multi-brand portfolio strategy. The Fox Restaurant Concepts (FRC) subsidiary acts as an incubator for new restaurant concepts.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "R&D" is embedded in its culinary development and concept incubation through FRC. While specific R&D spending figures are not disclosed, the successful expansion of North Italia and Flower Child, along with the continuous introduction of new menu items, demonstrates effective development efforts. The FRC acquisition serves as a pipeline for future growth concepts.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales organization is primarily its restaurant operations and marketing. The Cheesecake Factory has consistently high average unit volumes, demonstrating strong operational execution. The launch of the Cheesecake Rewards® program in mid-2023 is a strategic move to leverage data and enhance customer engagement, which is a key component of a modern sales strategy. The company also utilizes social media and digital marketing to engage with customers.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, the company's income from operations was 5.0% of revenues. While this is an improvement from 3.2% in fiscal 2023, it is still relatively low compared to historical levels and some peers. The company has faced significant cost pressures in recent years.

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Cheesecake Factory has been named to Fortune magazine's list of "100 Best Companies to Work For®" for eleven consecutive years as of 2024.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team has a mix of long-tenured members and experienced external hires. David Overton, the founder, remains Chairman and CEO. David Gordon, the President, has been with the company since 1993. The stability of key leadership roles suggests positive executive relations.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a well-defined executive team with clear roles and responsibilities. The promotion of David Gordon to President in 2013 and the hiring of Matthew Clark as CFO in 2017 demonstrate a thoughtful approach to management structure. The FRC subsidiary operates with its own leadership, providing another layer of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly traded company, The Cheesecake Factory is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and has its financial statements audited by an independent registered public accounting firm. The 2024 10-K includes a report from management on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, stating that it was effective as of December 31, 2024.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's in-house bakery operations are a significant competitive advantage. This vertical integration allows for control over the quality and innovation of its signature dessert offerings, which is a key brand differentiator. The extensive and complex menu, prepared from scratch, also sets it apart from many competitors.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy of incubating and acquiring new growth concepts demonstrates a long-range outlook. The continued investment in new unit openings for North Italia and Flower Child, despite the associated preopening costs that impact short-term profits, indicates a focus on durable, long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, the company had $84.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and net availability for borrowings of $256.5 million under its revolving credit facility. The company also has a share repurchase program in place, which further suggests that it does not anticipate the need for equity financing. Cash flow from operations is also a significant source of liquidity.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls, SEC filings, and investor presentations. The transcripts of these calls show a willingness to discuss both positive and negative aspects of the business, including challenges related to inflation, labor costs, and consumer traffic. This level of transparency suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

**Answer:** Yes

### Synthesis

The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated scores well on Fisher's checklist, with strong marks for its growth potential, commitment to development, and management quality. The company's multi-brand strategy, particularly the expansion of North Italia and Flower Child, provides a long runway for growth. The in-house bakery and extensive menu are key competitive advantages. The primary area of weakness is in profit margins, which have been compressed by inflation and other cost pressures.

The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12–24 months are the success of the company's margin improvement initiatives and the continued unit growth and performance of its emerging brands. A sustained improvement in operating margins would turn the "No" on point 5 to a "Yes." Conversely, a slowdown in the expansion or a decline in the unit economics of North Italia or Flower Child could negatively impact the long-term growth outlook.
