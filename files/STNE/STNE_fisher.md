### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has explicitly stated a focus on innovation and platform expansion. After divesting certain software assets, the company is refocusing resources on its core payments, banking, and credit services for merchants. The expansion of credit offerings and the growing adoption of its banking solutions (evidenced by a 36.4% YoY increase in retail deposits in Q2 2025) highlight this commitment. This strategic narrowing is designed to deepen their relationship with their core SMB clients rather than broadening into unrelated areas.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific, recent, and verifiable data available from earnings calls or financial filings that breaks down R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue or provides metrics on its direct output (e.g., patents, feature velocity). While the company discusses innovation and platform expansion, it does not provide the quantitative data needed to assess the effectiveness of its R&D relative to its size or peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** Not available in recent public disclosures.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's continued client growth suggests an effective sales model. The active payment client base in the MSMB (Micro, Small and Medium Business) segment grew 17% YoY in Q1 2025. For Q2 2025, the banking segment's active client base increased by 22.9% YoY. This consistent double-digit growth in client acquisition in its core segment points to a high-functioning sales and distribution network.

The company's adjusted gross profit grew 13.9% YoY to R$1,561.5 million in the same period. Consolidated return on equity (ROE) was 22% in Q2 2025, with the core Financial Services segment delivering an even higher ROE of 30%. These figures indicate very strong and worthwhile profit margins.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement through multiple levers. In Q1 2025, gross profit growth was driven by repricing initiatives. In Q2 2025, gross profit grew faster than TPV, driven by pricing discipline and a more efficient funding strategy using low-cost client deposits. The company is also realizing operating leverage, with administrative and selling expenses decreasing as a percentage of revenue in Q2 2025.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Public disclosures from recent earnings calls and press releases do not provide specific metrics on employee attrition, engagement, or labor relations. While a company's success implies a functional workforce, there is no concrete, recent evidence available to definitively assess the state of its personnel relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** Not available in recent public disclosures.

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, including CEO Pedro Zinner, CFO Mateus Scherer, and Chief Strategy Officer Lia Machado de Matos, presented a unified strategy on the Q2 2025 earnings call. The strategic decision to divest certain software assets and focus on core financial services appears to be a clear, board-supported direction. There have been no recent reports of executive turnover or discord. This stability and strategic alignment suggest solid executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Q2 2025 earnings call featured the CEO, CFO, and Chief Strategy & Marketing Officer, all speaking to their respective areas of the business in detail. This demonstrates a bench of senior leaders beyond the CEO who are client-facing and responsible for key strategic pillars. While a full succession plan is not publicly detailed, the presence and active participation of multiple senior executives in investor communications suggest management depth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** StoneCo's earnings releases provide detailed breakdowns of revenue, cost of services, and operating expenses, including specific discussions on administrative and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue. Management explicitly discusses actions taken to control costs and improve operating leverage. The company's Form 20-F, filed with the SEC, contains audited financial statements and disclosures on internal controls, and the latest earnings call references this document as containing key risk disclosures.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the SMB fintech space is building an integrated ecosystem that creates high switching costs. StoneCo's strategy of bundling payment processing with banking services (deposits, cards) and credit is central to this. The 36.4% YoY growth in total retail deposits in Q2 2025 shows this "platform" strategy is working, as it not only deepens the client relationship but also provides a low-cost source of funding for its operations, a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is pursuing a dual objective of strong near-term profitability and long-term growth. The company raised its full-year 2025 EPS growth guidance substantially from 18% to 32%, reflecting strong execution. Simultaneously, strategic actions like divesting non-core software assets are aimed at focusing resources on the core financial services platform for more durable, long-term growth. The use of share buybacks also signals confidence in the long-term value of the stock over short-term cash preservation.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position appears strong. Instead of issuing shares, StoneCo has been actively repurchasing them, buying back R$843 million (15.1 million shares) in Q1 2025. The strong growth in adjusted net income and operating cash flow, combined with an increasing base of low-cost deposits, provides ample capital for reinvestment. These factors strongly suggest that the company can fund its growth without dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed quarterly earnings presentations and hosts calls where they answer analyst questions. In the Q2 2025 call, they addressed specific drivers of expense lines, such as the impact of higher interest rates on financial expenses, and provided updated annual guidance with clear reasoning. They also reference their SEC filings for a full picture of business risks, directing investors to comprehensive disclosures. This level of detail and accessibility points to a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent legal or regulatory issues, related-party transaction red flags, or governance scandals cited in the reviewed sources. The company operates in a highly regulated industry and provides financial disclosures in accordance with SEC standards as a foreign private issuer. Without any evidence to the contrary, management's integrity appears to be unquestionable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Not applicable; based on the absence of negative evidence in reviewed public materials.

**Synthesis**

StoneCo scores highly on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strong, profitable growth in its core Brazilian SMB market and a clear, focused strategy. The company's primary strengths are its expanding profit margins, effective ecosystem strategy that leverages banking deposits for a competitive advantage, and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy (buybacks, not dilution). The main weaknesses in this analysis stem from a lack of specific public data on qualitative metrics like R&D effectiveness and personnel relations. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: 1) the continued execution of its integrated payments and banking strategy, evidenced by sustained growth in clients and deposits, and 2) its ability to successfully scale its credit offerings without incurring major losses, which remains a key growth vector. A "No" on R&D could flip to "Yes" if future disclosures provide more granular metrics on innovation spending and returns.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
