Lockheed Martin Corporation, August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Lockheed Martin 2024 10-K, Lockheed Martin investor relations, various news and trade publications.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin's backlog reached a record $176 billion at the end of 2024, an increase of 10% year-over-year, which is more than double its annual revenue. This backlog is driven by strong and growing demand for its key programs, including the F-35 fighter jet, PAC-3 missiles, and space systems. The F-35 program alone, which constitutes 26% of total sales, has a multi-decade lifespan with ongoing production, sustainment, and modernization contracts from the U.S. government and a growing list of international partners. The current geopolitical climate, with heightened global tensions, is leading to increased defense budgets worldwide, further bolstering the long-term demand for Lockheed Martin's products and services.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin consistently invests in research and development to maintain its technological lead and develop next-generation capabilities. In 2024, the company invested over $3 billion in R&D and capital expenditures. This commitment is evident in their focus on hypersonics, directed energy, and advanced manufacturing.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Lockheed Martin's company-funded R&D spending was $1.6 billion, which represents approximately 2.25% of its $71.04 billion in revenue. While a direct comparison of R&D output is challenging, Lockheed Martin's continued success in securing large, technologically advanced contracts, such as the Next Generation Interceptor and various hypersonic programs, demonstrates the effectiveness of its R&D investments. The company's focus on "21st Century Security" and its investments in areas like AI, autonomy, and digital engineering are aimed at maintaining a technological edge over competitors.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin's sales are predominantly to the U.S. government (73% of 2024 revenue), which involves a different sales process than commercial markets. The company's success in securing and maintaining large, long-term government contracts, and in growing its international sales, indicates a highly effective sales and government relations organization. The consistent growth in their backlog, reaching a record $176 billion in 2024, further demonstrates their ability to win new business and expand existing programs. The company's deep, long-standing relationships with the Department of Defense and other government agencies are a key competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Lockheed Martin reported a consolidated operating margin of 9.9%. While this is a respectable margin for the defense industry, it has been impacted by charges on classified programs. The company has guided for a return to 11% operating profit margins in 2025, which is more in line with their historical performance. For comparison, the company's operating margin in 2023 was 12.6%. The long-term nature of its contracts and the ability to negotiate pricing on large programs generally allow for stable and predictable margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGZpBGMQYHN9kKF_0vdNrrUSN-CCObadMkaW8h1YnRKbYU4vEXSP2PtWqw1s4FZFmA_n8ozv25e2E28c932jT7r8KVEvKBZBw5pf5Zq0PvH_EWNWLxPhB6ffP9w0fVndjLA0UzQ7peT1ym2_-_khg=="] (April 22, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin is focused on improving operational efficiency and reducing costs to enhance margins. Their "21st Century Security" initiative includes investments in digital transformation and advanced manufacturing technologies to drive efficiencies. The company is also actively managing its supply chain to mitigate the impacts of inflation and supply disruptions, which are key pressures on margins. Additionally, the company is shifting its portfolio towards higher-margin areas like sustainment and modernization, which are growing components of their major programs.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, approximately 19% of Lockheed Martin's employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The company states in its 10-K that it considers its employee and union relations to be good and has a history of successfully renegotiating expiring agreements without material disruption. Recent contract ratifications, such as the one in April 2022 with the Machinists Union in Fort Worth, included historic pay increases and strong benefits, suggesting a collaborative approach to labor negotiations. The company also emphasizes its commitment to employee satisfaction and offers competitive compensation and benefits.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin has a stable and experienced executive leadership team. James D. Taiclet has served as Chairman, President, and CEO since 2020 and has been on the board since 2018. The company has a clear succession plan, with key executive roles filled by long-tenured employees who have risen through the ranks. This stability at the top provides for consistent strategic direction and a deep understanding of the business and its customers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/936468/000093646825000009/lmt-20241231.htm"]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin's management structure includes a deep bench of experienced leaders across its four business segments. The company's 2024 10-K filing lists the executive officers, highlighting their extensive experience within the company and the aerospace and defense industry.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/936468/000093646825000009/lmt-20241231.htm"]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a major U.S. government contractor, Lockheed Martin is subject to rigorous oversight and audits of its accounting and control systems by the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). The company's financial statements are audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, which has consistently issued unqualified opinions. The detailed segment reporting in their 10-K provides a good level of transparency into the company's cost structure and profitability by program. The company has a robust internal control framework to ensure compliance with government contracting regulations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/936468/000093646825000009/lmt-20241231.htm"]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the aerospace and defense industry, a key competitive advantage is the ability to manage large, complex, and technologically advanced programs over very long time horizons. Lockheed Martin's position as the prime contractor on cornerstone programs like the F-35, and its leadership in areas like hypersonics and space, demonstrate this capability. The high barriers to entry in this industry, including the need for specialized expertise, extensive manufacturing facilities, and strong government relationships, create a significant moat around Lockheed Martin's business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/936468/000093646825000009/lmt-20241231.htm"]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin's business is inherently long-cycle, with programs that span decades from development to production and sustainment. The company's consistent investment in R&D, even when it impacts short-term margins, demonstrates a focus on long-term technological leadership and future growth. Their strategic focus on "21st Century Security" and the development of next-generation capabilities in areas like hypersonics and space are clear indicators of a long-range profit outlook. Management's guidance often emphasizes long-term growth targets and the durability of their backlog.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/936468/000093646825000009/lmt-20241231.htm"]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin has a strong balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow ($5.3 billion in 2024). The company has a consistent history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, rather than issuing new shares. In 2024, the company paid $3.7 billion to repurchase 7.5 million shares. This demonstrates that the company can fund its operations and growth initiatives without diluting existing shareholders. The company's access to the debt markets provides additional financial flexibility.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lockheed Martin's management maintains a regular and open dialogue with the investment community through quarterly earnings calls, investor conferences, and detailed financial filings. They provide specific and detailed guidance on their financial performance and are transparent about the challenges and risks they face. For example, the company has been open about the challenges with the F-35 program, including software delays and cost pressures, and has discussed the impacts of supply chain disruptions on their operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://discountingcashflows.com/company/LMT/transcripts/"]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a leading defense contractor, Lockheed Martin is subject to a high level of scrutiny and operates under a strict code of ethics and compliance. The company has a robust ethics and compliance program, and there have been no recent major scandals or legal issues that would call into question the integrity of its management. The company's commitment to transparency and its long-standing relationships with its government customers are further indicators of its commitment to ethical conduct.
**Answer:** Yes

---
Synthesis: Lockheed Martin scores very highly on Fisher's 15 points, reflecting its strong market position, technological leadership, and financial strength. The company's massive and growing backlog provides excellent visibility into future revenues, and its commitment to R&D ensures a pipeline of future growth drivers. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the execution of the F-35 program, particularly the software and TR-3 upgrades, and the ability to manage supply chain and inflationary pressures to maintain and improve profit margins. A significant deterioration in the geopolitical environment could also impact the company, though it is more likely to increase demand for its products. Any "No" answers could be flipped to "Yes" with evidence of a sustained improvement in profit margins back to their historical levels and a reduction in the charges related to classified programs.

fisher score is 15 / 15
