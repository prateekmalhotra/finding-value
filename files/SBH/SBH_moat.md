One of the provided URLs failed to load. I will proceed with the information gathered from the other filings. I have browsed the 10-K for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2024, and the 10-Qs for the quarters ending December 31, 2024, and March 31, 2025. This should provide sufficient recent data to perform the moat analysis. I will now proceed with the analysis of each dimension as planned. I will start by looking for information related to "Network Effects."

After reviewing the documents, I find no evidence of network effects. Sally Beauty is a retailer and distributor, and its business model does not benefit from classic network effects where the value of the service increases with the number of users. I will assign a score of 0 to this dimension.

Next, I'll assess "Switching Costs." For retail customers, switching costs are virtually nonexistent. For salon professionals, there might be some minor switching costs related to familiarity with products and the convenience of their local Cosmo Prof store, but these are not significant barriers. I'll search for any information on customer loyalty programs that might create some stickiness.

The 10-K mentions the "Sally Beauty Rewards Program" with approximately 15 million members in the U.S. and Canada, accounting for 76.7% of sales. While this indicates a degree of customer loyalty, it doesn't represent a significant switching cost. I'll score this dimension low.

Now I will analyze "Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership." Sally Beauty's scale as a large specialty retailer and distributor might provide some purchasing power with suppliers. They also have a significant portfolio of owned brands, which could contribute to a cost advantage. I'll look for data on gross margins compared to peers and any specific disclosures on cost advantages.

The 10-K mentions that for fiscal year 2024, SBS U.S. and Canada-owned brand sales were approximately 34% of total SBS U.S. and Canada sales. The consolidated gross margin was 50.9% for fiscal year 2024. Without direct peer comparisons in the provided documents, it is difficult to definitively assess a cost advantage. However, the significant portion of sales from owned brands and the company's scale suggest a moderate advantage.

Next is "Intangible Assets / Brand / IP." Sally Beauty and Cosmo Prof are well-known brands in their respective segments. The company also has numerous owned brands like ION and Beyond the Zone. I'll look for information on trademarks and brand recognition.

The 10-K states, "We believe many of these are well recognized and have significant value, including but not limited to the following: Sally®, Sally Beauty®, Cosmo Prof®, Armstrong McCall®, ION® and Beyond the Zone®." While brand recognition exists, there's no evidence of a significant price premium or other quantifiable brand strength metrics.

Now for "Distribution & Efficient Scale." Sally Beauty has a large and dense network of stores and distribution centers. This extensive physical footprint could be a deterrent to new entrants. I'll look for details on store count and distribution infrastructure.

The 2024 10-K reports a total of 4,460 stores (3,129 SBS and 1,331 BSG) and several large distribution centers. This extensive network, particularly for the professional-focused BSG business, represents a significant barrier to entry.

For "Data Advantage," I will look for any mention of unique datasets that provide a competitive advantage. The loyalty program provides valuable customer data, but the filings do not detail how this data is used to create a competitive moat. I'll score this low.

For "Ecosystem / Platform Effects," I will check for evidence of third-party adoption, complementary product marketplaces, or integrations. The filings mention digital marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart.com, but these are sales channels, not platforms creating an ecosystem. I'll score this as 0.

For "Regulatory / Legal Barriers," I'll look for any exclusive licenses or regulatory protections. The 10-K mentions that BSG has exclusive distribution rights with several key vendors in certain geographies. This is a form of regulatory/legal barrier, albeit a contractual one.

For "Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity," I'll look for information on the capital required to compete in this industry. The business is not capital-intensive in the traditional sense of heavy manufacturing, but the large number of stores and distribution centers represents a significant investment.

For "Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility," Sally Beauty is a retail business with no long-term customer contracts. I will score this as 0.

Now I'll consolidate my findings and write the report.

Preliminary moat rating: 1 / 5; estimated durability: ~3–5 years

| **Total** | **100%** | | **12.9** |

### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Sally Beauty Holdings' business model as a specialty retailer and distributor does not exhibit network effects. The value of its products and services does not increase for a user as more users join its network. It is a traditional retail model, and its value proposition is based on product assortment, price, and convenience, not on a user network.
**Evidence:**
*   An analysis of the business description in the company's 10-K reveals a traditional retail and distribution model, with no mention of network effects or platform dynamics. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for both retail customers and salon professionals are low. While the Sally Beauty Rewards program, with 15 million members, creates some customer stickiness, it does not represent a significant barrier to switching to a competitor. Salon professionals may have some familiarity with the product assortment and store layout, but these are minor inconveniences rather than substantial switching costs.
**Evidence:**
*   The Sally Beauty Rewards Program has approximately 15 million members in the U.S. and Canada, accounting for 76.7% of sales in fiscal year 2024. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Sally Beauty likely benefits from some economies of scale in purchasing due to its large size. Additionally, its portfolio of owned brands, which account for a significant portion of sales, likely provides a margin advantage over third-party brands. However, without direct data on per-unit cost advantages over peers, this score remains conservative.
**Evidence:**
*   In fiscal year 2024, owned brand sales in the U.S. and Canada for the SBS segment were approximately 34% of total sales for that segment. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
*   Consolidated gross margin for fiscal year 2024 was 50.9%. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** Sally Beauty owns several well-recognized trademarks, including Sally Beauty, Cosmo Prof, and a portfolio of owned brands. These brands are valuable assets that drive customer recognition and loyalty. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that these brands command a significant price premium over competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   The company has registered or legally protected trademarks, including Sally®, Sally Beauty®, Cosmo Prof®, Armstrong McCall®, ION® and Beyond the Zone®, which it believes are well recognized and have significant value. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** SBH's extensive distribution network and dense physical store footprint, particularly in the professional channel, create a significant barrier to entry. A new competitor would need to make substantial investments to replicate this scale. This efficient scale allows SBH to serve a broad customer base and maintain a strong market presence.
**Evidence:**
*   As of September 30, 2024, the company operated a total of 4,460 stores, including 3,129 SBS stores and 1,331 BSG stores (including franchises). (10-K, November 14, 2024)
*   The company operates a network of distribution centers in the U.S. and various other countries to service its stores and e-commerce operations. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** The Sally Beauty Rewards program provides the company with valuable customer data. However, the company's filings do not provide specific examples of how this data is being used to create a durable competitive advantage. The data is likely used for marketing and promotions, but there is no evidence of a data-driven feedback loop that significantly improves the product or service offering.
**Evidence:**
*   The Sally Beauty Rewards Program has approximately 15 million members in the U.S. and Canada. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Sally Beauty does not operate an ecosystem or platform business model. While it sells through third-party digital marketplaces like Amazon and Walmart.com, these are simply additional sales channels and do not create a platform with third-party developers or complementary products that would lock in customers.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's description of its business in its 10-K does not indicate the presence of an ecosystem or platform model. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The company's BSG segment benefits from exclusive distribution rights with several key vendors in certain geographies. These exclusive agreements create a barrier to entry for competitors in those markets. However, these agreements can be terminated, making this a less durable advantage than government-granted licenses or patents.
**Evidence:**
*   BSG has exclusive distribution rights with several key vendors for well-known brands in certain geographies. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** While the capital required to open a single store is relatively low, the cumulative investment in a large network of stores and distribution centers is substantial. This capital intensity creates a barrier to entry for new competitors who would need to raise significant capital to compete at a similar scale.
**Evidence:**
*   The company operates a large network of 4,460 stores and multiple distribution centers, representing a significant capital investment. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** As a retailer, Sally Beauty has no long-term customer contracts. Revenue is transactional, and there is no recurring revenue stream to provide visibility into future sales.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's revenue recognition policy states that "Substantially all of our revenue is derived through the sale of merchandise at the point-of-sale in our stores or when products are shipped for e-commerce orders." (10-Q, February 13, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **Aggregation**
Weighted Score = (0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.15 + 0.30 + 0.24 + 0.30 + 0.10 + 0 + 0.12 + 0.08 + 0 = 1.29. *Correction: The weighted score is 12.9, not 1.29.*

Weighted Score = 12.9 / 100

### **Mapping**
A weighted score of 12.9 falls into the 10 <= Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is 3–5 years. The company's primary competitive advantages are its distribution scale and exclusive distribution rights. The exclusive distribution rights are subject to termination, and the retail landscape is highly competitive, which could erode the company's market position over time.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Loss of Exclusive Distribution Rights:** Key suppliers could choose to terminate their exclusive agreements with BSG, which would allow competitors to sell the same products and erode BSG's market position. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
2.  **Increased Competition from Online Retailers:** The continued growth of e-commerce and the ease of comparison shopping could put pressure on prices and margins, eroding Sally Beauty's market share and profitability. (10-K, November 14, 2024)
3.  **Shifting Consumer Preferences:** A rapid shift in consumer preferences away from the types of products that Sally Beauty specializes in, or a decline in the popularity of at-home beauty treatments, could negatively impact sales. (10-K, November 14, 2024)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Comparable Sales Growth:** A decline in comparable sales could indicate an erosion of the company's competitive position.
*   **Gross Margin:** A decline in gross margin could indicate increased price competition or a loss of purchasing power.
*   **Owned Brand Sales Penetration:** A decrease in the percentage of sales from owned brands could negatively impact margins.
*   **Sally Beauty Rewards Membership and Sales Penetration:** A decline in membership or the percentage of sales from members could indicate a decrease in customer loyalty.
*   **E-commerce Sales Growth:** Stagnant or declining e-commerce sales could indicate that the company is not keeping up with the shift to online shopping.
*   **Store Count and Productivity:** A significant decline in the number of stores or a decrease in sales per store could indicate a weakening of the company's distribution advantage.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Sally Beauty Holdings, Inc. has a narrow moat based on its distribution scale and exclusive distribution rights. The company's extensive network of stores and distribution centers, particularly in the professional channel, creates a barrier to entry. However, the company faces significant competition from a variety of retailers, and its lack of significant switching costs or network effects makes it vulnerable to market share losses. An increase in the durability and exclusivity of its supplier contracts, or the development of a more substantial data advantage, would be necessary to justify a higher moat rating.

moat rating is 1 / 5
