**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere has a consistent record of investing in research and development to bring new products and technologies to market. In fiscal year 2024, the company spent approximately $2.3 billion on R&D, an increase from the prior year, focusing on new technology solutions and product introductions. Recent examples of new products include the S7 Series combines and updated 9RX tractors, designed to enhance automation and efficiency. The company's "Leap Ambitions" framework explicitly guides investment in digitalization, autonomy, automation, and alternative power technologies to create future revenue streams.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's R&D spending is significant and competitive within its industry. In 2021, Deere's R&D spending as a percentage of ag sales was 5.6%, second only to CNH Industrial at 8.4%, but ahead of Kubota (4.58%) and AGCO (3.6%). The company's focus is on integrating technology into its core products, with a "technology stack" that delivers intelligent solutions through hardware, software, connectivity, and data platforms. The launch of products with advanced automation and the focus on a Solutions as a Service business model are evidence of R&D effectiveness.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's primary competitive advantage is its extensive and well-established independent dealer network. In the U.S. and Canada alone, the company markets products through approximately 2,050 dealer locations. This network provides a significant barrier to entry for competitors and allows for strong customer relationships and service. The company's brand recognition is a key competitive factor, further strengthening the sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere has demonstrated strong profitability. For fiscal year 2024, the operating margin for the Production and Precision Agriculture segment was 21.7%, for Small Agriculture and Turf it was 14.8%, and for Construction and Forestry it was 15.5%. While these are down from the prior year due to market conditions, they are still robust. The company is focused on structural profitability through its strategic initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere is actively managing its profitability in response to market conditions. In the third quarter of 2024, the company implemented employee-separation programs to reduce redundancies and improve efficiency, with an estimated annual pretax savings of about $220 million. The company is also focused on cost reduction measures to manage inventory levels and production costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Approximately 77% of Deere's U.S. production and maintenance employees are represented by unions. The company has a collective bargaining agreement with the UAW that expires in November 2027. While the company has not reported any major labor disputes recently, the high percentage of unionized workforce means that labor relations are a constant focus and risk. There is no clear evidence of "outstanding" relations, so a conservative answer is appropriate.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Deere appears stable, with many long-tenured executives. The "Information about our Executive Officers" section in the 2024 10-K shows a team with significant experience within the company and the industry. There is no evidence of significant executive turnover or internal conflicts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's executive team is comprised of presidents for each major division (Worldwide Agriculture & Turf, Worldwide Construction & Forestry, etc.), as well as a Chief Technology Officer and Chief Financial Officer, indicating a clear structure with experienced leaders in key roles. The detailed list of executive officers in the 10-K suggests a deep bench of management talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its fiscal year 2024 10-K, Deere's management concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of October 27, 2024. The independent registered public accounting firm also issued an unqualified audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. This provides strong evidence of good accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's key competitive advantage is the combination of its strong dealer network and its leadership in precision agriculture technology. The company's "technology stack" is designed to create a competitive moat by offering integrated solutions that are difficult for competitors to replicate. This focus on technology and data provides a significant advantage in an industry where efficiency and productivity are paramount.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere's strategic framework, including the "Smart Industrial Operating Model" and "Leap Ambitions," is inherently long-term. The company's continued investment in R&D and technology, even as the agricultural market faces a cyclical downturn, demonstrates a willingness to prioritize long-term growth over short-term profitability. Management's discussion and analysis consistently emphasizes these long-range strategic goals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deere has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations ($9.2 billion in fiscal 2024). The company has a share repurchase plan in place, indicating it is returning capital to shareholders, not seeking to dilute them. The combination of strong cash flow and access to debt markets suggests a low risk of equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/315189/000155837024016169/de-20241027x10k.htm) (Filed November 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of Deere's earnings call transcripts from 2024 and 2025 indicates that management is open about the cyclical challenges facing the agriculture and construction industries. They provide a detailed outlook for each segment, including expected declines in sales and the factors driving them. This level of transparency suggests a willingness to communicate openly with investors during both favorable and unfavorable market conditions.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, Deere agreed to pay approximately $10 million to the SEC to resolve charges that the company violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) arising from improper payments by a wholly-owned subsidiary in Thailand. While the company has a Code of Business Conduct and compliance programs in place, this violation raises questions about the integrity of its international operations.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Deere & Company scores well on most of Fisher's points, with its primary strengths being its long-term growth potential in precision agriculture, a strong commitment to R&D, a dominant sales and distribution network, and a solid financial position. The company's management appears stable and focused on a long-range strategy. The main weaknesses identified are in the areas of labor relations, due to a heavily unionized workforce, and unquestionable integrity, due to a recent FCPA violation. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the cyclical downturn in the agricultural and construction markets, which will test the company's ability to maintain its margins and continue to invest for the long term. A change in the "No" for labor relations would require a long period of demonstrated stability and positive engagement with its unions, while a change in the "No" for integrity would require a clean record over the next several years and a clear demonstration that the issues that led to the FCPA violation have been fully addressed.

fisher score is 13 / 15
