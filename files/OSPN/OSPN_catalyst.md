### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On May 9, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $50.0 million of the company's common stock, effective until May 9, 2026. This demonstrates confidence in the company's intrinsic value and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and, consequently, the stock price. The repurchase program can also signal to the market that the company's management believes the stock is undervalued, potentially attracting new investors.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – May 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Repurchase of $15 million in shares. At an average price of $13.00, this would retire approximately 1.15 million shares, or ~3.0% of the 38.1 million shares outstanding as of March 31, 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Repurchase of $30 million in shares. At an average price of $13.00, this would retire approximately 2.31 million shares, or ~6.1% of shares outstanding.
    *   **High Scenario:** Repurchase of the full $50 million authorization. At an average price of $13.00, this would retire approximately 3.85 million shares, or ~10.1% of shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). The repurchase of a significant portion of outstanding shares can provide a strong boost to EPS and investor confidence.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a history of executing on its repurchase authorizations and has a strong cash position to fund the program.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price remaining at a level management deems attractive for buybacks.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in the company's 10-Q and 10-K filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant increase in the stock price could make the repurchase program less accretive and lead to a reduction in buyback activity.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The repurchase program provides a clear and tangible catalyst for share price appreciation in the near term.

**2. Catalyst Title: Digital Agreements Segment Profitability**
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Digital Agreements segment achieved profitability for the first time in the third quarter of 2024 and was profitable for the full year 2024. This is a significant milestone that demonstrates the success of the company's strategic shift to focus on profitable growth.
*   **Mechanism:** Consistent profitability in the Digital Agreements segment will improve the company's overall profitability and cash flow, leading to a higher valuation multiple. The market has historically valued the Digital Agreements segment at a higher multiple than the legacy Security Solutions business.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Digital Agreements segment operating margin of 5%.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Digital Agreements segment operating margin of 10%.
    *   **High Scenario:** Digital Agreements segment operating margin of 15%.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (15-25%). Sustained profitability in the high-growth Digital Agreements segment could lead to a re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has already achieved profitability in this segment and has a clear strategy to maintain and improve it.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued execution of the company's cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly and annual financial reports, specifically the segment operating income and margins.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Increased competition in the e-signature market could pressure margins and lead to a return to losses for the segment.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The profitability of the Digital Agreements segment is a key driver of future growth and a potential source of significant value creation.

**3. Catalyst Title: Insider Buying**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In August 2025, two directors, Garry L. Capers and Marc Zenner, made open market purchases of OSPN stock. This follows purchases by other directors in March 2024.
*   **Mechanism:** Insider buying is often interpreted by the market as a strong signal of confidence in a company's future prospects. This can attract new investors and lead to an increase in the stock price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – February 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** No further insider buying.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Additional insider purchases by one or two directors.
    *   **High Scenario:** Significant insider purchases by multiple directors and executive officers.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (5-10%). While a positive signal, insider buying alone is unlikely to have a material impact on the stock price without other supporting catalysts.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The recent purchases by multiple directors suggest that there is a good chance of further insider buying in the near term.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The stock price remaining at a level that insiders perceive as undervalued.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Form 4 filings with the SEC, which report insider transactions.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Insider selling could negate the positive signal from insider buying and put downward pressure on the stock price.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. While a positive indicator, investors should look for other catalysts to support a long-term investment thesis.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Continued Transition to a Subscription-Based Revenue Model**
*   **Type:** Financial/Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** OneSpan is actively transitioning its business from a perpetual license and hardware-based model to a subscription-based model. In 2024, subscription revenue grew 33% in Security Solutions and 28% in Digital Agreements.
*   **Mechanism:** A subscription-based model provides a more predictable and recurring revenue stream, which is typically valued at a higher multiple by the market. This transition will also improve the company's gross margins, as software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings have a lower cost of goods sold than hardware products.
*   **Timing:** 2025 – 2029
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Subscription revenue reaches 65% of total revenue.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Subscription revenue reaches 75% of total revenue.
    *   **High Scenario:** Subscription revenue reaches 85% of total revenue.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A successful transition to a subscription-based model could lead to a significant re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has already made significant progress in this transition and has a clear strategy to continue it.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued customer adoption of the company's subscription offerings.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Annual recurring revenue (ARR), net retention rate (NRR), and the percentage of total revenue from subscriptions.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A slowdown in the adoption of subscription-based services could hinder the company's progress and negatively impact its valuation.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The transition to a subscription-based revenue model is a long-term catalyst that has the potential to create significant value for shareholders.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (Short)**

**1. Share Repurchase Program**
*   **Formula:** (Current Market Cap / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) \* (1 + Premium)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Market Cap: $495 million (38.1 million shares \* $13.00/share)
    *   Shares Repurchased: 2.31 million (Base Scenario)
    *   Premium: 10% (due to increased EPS and investor confidence)
*   **Calculation:** ($495 million / (38.1 million - 2.31 million)) \* 1.10 = **$15.20/share** (a 17% increase)

**2. Digital Agreements Segment Profitability**
*   **Formula:** (Security Solutions Revenue \* Security Solutions Multiple) + (Digital Agreements Revenue \* Digital Agreements Multiple) / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Security Solutions Revenue: $182.2 million
    *   Security Solutions Multiple: 1.5x (in line with legacy hardware companies)
    *   Digital Agreements Revenue: $61.0 million
    *   Digital Agreements Multiple: 5.0x (in line with profitable SaaS companies)
    *   Shares Outstanding: 38.1 million
*   **Calculation:** (($182.2 million \* 1.5) + ($61.0 million \* 5.0)) / 38.1 million = **$15.17/share** (a 17% increase)

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Increased Competition:** The markets for both security solutions and digital agreements are highly competitive. Increased competition from larger players like DocuSign and Adobe could pressure margins and hinder growth.
2.  **Execution Risk:** The company's success is dependent on its ability to execute on its strategic plan, including the transition to a subscription-based model and the continued profitability of the Digital Agreements segment. Any missteps could have a significant negative impact on the stock price.
3.  **Cybersecurity Breach:** As a cybersecurity company, a significant security breach of OneSpan's own systems would be devastating to its reputation and could lead to a loss of customers and a sharp decline in the stock price.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

OneSpan presents a compelling investment opportunity with a number of near- and long-term catalysts that could drive the stock price materially higher. The share repurchase program and the achievement of profitability in the Digital Agreements segment are two of the most significant near-term catalysts, with the potential to drive the stock price up by 15-25%. The most important indicator to monitor is the continued profitability of the Digital Agreements segment, as this will be the primary driver of long-term value creation.
