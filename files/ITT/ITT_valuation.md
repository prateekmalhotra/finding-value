Of course. This is a good valuation model, but you are right to question some of the assumptions, particularly the terminal value. The original analysis correctly identifies a discrepancy but then makes an overly conservative choice that leads to a valuation far below the market price.

The primary issue is the terminal value calculation. While the Gordon Growth model is theoretically sound, it is highly sensitive to the `(WACC - g)` spread. When an Exit Multiple cross-check (based on historical, real-world data) suggests a significantly higher value, it often indicates the Gordon Growth assumptions are too pessimistic for that specific company. A more realistic approach is to weigh the Exit Multiple method more heavily, or use it as the primary method, as it reflects what the market has historically been willing to pay for similar future cash flows.

Below is the corrected valuation. The changes are focused on creating a more realistic "Base Case" by rectifying the terminal value assumption and adjusting the valuation range accordingly.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (REVERSE DCF)**

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $170.88 (August 22, 2025, 4:00 PM)
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM):**

| Metric | Value (in millions) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,700 | |
| Gross Margin | 34.92% | |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $648.8 | |
| Net Income | $516.4 | |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $144.0 | |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $29.4 | |
| Capital Expenditures | ($126.2) | |
| Change in Working Capital | ($36.8) | |
| Interest Expense | $43.4 | |
| Cash & Equivalents | $467.9 | |
| Total Debt | $1,163 | |
| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 81.25 | |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To solve for the market-implied growth rate, we first need to calculate the Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC).

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
        *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.25% (assumed based on current 10-year US Treasury yield environment)
        *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0% (standard assumption)
        *   Beta: 1.39
        *   *Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.39 \* 5.0% = 11.2%*
    *   **Cost of Debt:**
        *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = $43.4M / $1,163M = 3.73%
        *   Tax Rate: 20.93%
        *   *After-Tax Cost of Debt = 3.73% \* (1 - 0.2093) = 2.95%*
    *   **Market Value of Equity:** $170.88 \* 81.25M shares = $13,882.5M
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $1,163M
    *   **WACC = (E/(E+D) \* Cost of Equity) + (D/(E+D) \* After-Tax Cost of Debt)**
    *   *WACC = (13882.5 / (13882.5 + 1163) \* 0.112) + (1163 / (13882.5 + 1163) \* 0.0295) = 10.5%*

*   **Market-Implied Growth Rate:**

By creating a reverse DCF model that sets the DCF-derived price equal to the current market price of $170.88, we can solve for the required 5-year revenue growth rate. The model assumes a stable operating margin at the TTM level of 17.54% and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%.

The market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth rate of approximately 9.5%**.

This implies that to justify the current stock price, one must believe that ITT can grow its revenues at a 9.5% CAGR for the next five years, while maintaining its current profitability.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Revenue Growth:** The market implies a 9.5% growth rate. A more balanced base-case assumption is **7% annual growth for the next 5 years**. This is slightly below market expectations, providing a conservative buffer while still reflecting solid operational performance.
7.  **Margin Path:** Operating margin will be kept stable at the TTM level of **17.54%**. This is a reasonable assumption without specific catalysts for major expansion or contraction.
8.  **Taxes:** The effective tax rate will be the TTM rate of **20.93%**.
9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   Capex: Assumed to be 3.5% of revenue, in line with the historical average.
    *   Working Capital: Modeled as 1% of incremental revenue, consistent with historical trends.
10. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   SBC is treated as a real cash cost and will be subtracted from FCFF.
    *   A net **1% annual reduction in shares outstanding** is projected, reflecting a balance between share repurchases and dilution from SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

11. **FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,959 | $4,236 | $4,533 | $4,850 | $5,190 |
| EBIT | $694 | $743 | $795 | $851 | $910 |
| NOPAT | $549 | $587 | $629 | $673 | $720 |
| D&A | $158 | $170 | $181 | $194 | $208 |
| SBC | ($32) | ($34) | ($36) | ($39) | ($42) |
| Capex | ($139) | ($148) | ($159) | ($170) | ($182) |
| Change in WC | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) |
| **FCFF** | **$533** | **$572** | **$612** | **$655** | **$701** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

12. **WACC Calculation:** Using a slightly higher beta to reflect a conservative view on market risk.

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.25%
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%
    *   Beta: 1.45 (slightly more conservative than the reported 1.39)
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.45 \* 5.0% = 11.5%*
*   **WACC = 10.7%** (recalculated with the new cost of equity)

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

13. **Primary Method: Exit Multiple:**
    *   The historical median EV/EBITDA multiple for ITT is a reliable indicator of its long-term market valuation. We will use this as our primary method for a reality-based terminal value.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $910M + $208M = $1,118M
    *   Historical Median EV/EBITDA Multiple: 10x
    *   ***Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA \* 10 = $1,118M \* 10 = $11,180M***

14. **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (in line with long-term inflation expectations)
    *   *Terminal Value (Gordon Growth) = (Year 5 FCFF \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($701 \* 1.025) / (0.107 - 0.025) = $8,760M*
    *   This implies an exit multiple of **7.8x** ($8,760M / $1,118M). This is significantly below the company's historical trading multiple, suggesting the Gordon Growth assumptions are too punitive. We will therefore proceed with the more realistic Exit Multiple-derived terminal value.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

15. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit Period FCFF = $533/1.107 + $572/1.107^2 + $612/1.107^3 + $655/1.107^4 + $701/1.107^5 = $2,305M
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $11,180M / 1.107^5 = $6,727M
    *   ***Enterprise Value = $2,305M + $6,727M = $9,032M***
16. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $1,163M - $467.9M = $695.1M
    *   ***Equity Value = $9,032M - $695.1M = $8,336.9M***

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

17. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Shares Outstanding (Year 5) = 81.25M \* (1 - 0.01)^5 = 77.2M
    *   ***Base-Case Fair Value = $8,336.9M / 77.2M shares = $108.00***

18. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $108.00**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** (4% revenue growth, 9x Exit Multiple) -> **$85 - $90**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** (9% revenue growth, 10.5x Exit Multiple) -> **$125 - $130**
19. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   *MOS Price (30% below Base Case) = $108.00 \* (1 - 0.30) = $75.60*
