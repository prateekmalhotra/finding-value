**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the provided documents highlight new product launches and innovations, they do not offer specific metrics to comprehensively assess R&D effectiveness relative to SAP's considerable size. Key performance indicators such as R&D as a percentage of revenue versus peers, patent filing success rates, or new product revenue contributions are not detailed. Without these quantifiable measures, a definitive "Yes" is not supported by the available evidence.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP's consistent double-digit revenue growth and expanding cloud backlog suggest a strong sales organization. The Q2 2025 earnings call transcript mentions a "robust pipeline for the second half of 2025" and highlights strong regional performance in APJ and EMEA, with "outstanding performance" in several countries. The strategic partnership with Alibaba to expand in the Chinese market is another indicator of a forward-looking and effective sales strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP reported a significant 35% surge in operating profit in Q2 2025, indicating robust profitability. The non-IFRS cloud gross margin expanded by 1.8 percentage points to 75.2%, a very healthy figure for a software company. This demonstrates strong profitability and the successful execution of its cloud transformation strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP is actively implementing measures to enhance its profit margins. The company's transformation program, which includes the internal adoption of Business AI, is driving operational efficiencies. The shift to a cloud-based model with expanding cloud gross margins is a key driver of profitability improvement.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided search results do not contain sufficient information to make a definitive assessment of SAP's labor and personnel relations. While the company's success implies a productive workforce, there is no specific data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations to substantiate a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The information available points to a stable and functioning executive team. The extension of Executive Board Member Thomas Saueressig's contract and the appointment of Sebastian Steinhaeuser to a new board area suggest a planned and strategic approach to leadership. However, without more detailed information on executive turnover rates, board dynamics, and succession planning, a conclusive assessment of "outstanding" executive relations is not possible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [SAP Investor Relations](https://www.sap.com/investors/en.html), July 22, 2025.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Q2 2025 earnings call was led by the CEO, Christian Klein, and CFO, Dominik Asam, demonstrating leadership from the top. The announcement of Sebastian Steinhaeuser joining the Executive Board to lead a new strategy and operations area also points to management depth. However, the provided information does not offer a comprehensive view of the management team's depth across all key business units.
**Answer:** No

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP SE's filing of the Annual Report on Form 20-F with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicates adherence to stringent accounting and reporting standards. The detailed financial reporting in the Q2 2025 results, including IFRS and non-IFRS operating profit, suggests a high level of financial control and transparency. However, a full audit of internal controls is not publicly available.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for SAP is the "stickiness" of its enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. Once a company integrates an SAP ERP system into its core operations, the high switching costs and business disruption involved in changing vendors create a significant competitive moat. The strong and consistent growth of the Cloud ERP Suite, which represents 86% of total cloud revenue, underscores the strength of this customer lock-in.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP's strategic shift to a cloud-based subscription model, which has involved short-term revenue and margin trade-offs, demonstrates a long-range profit outlook. The ongoing investments in Business AI and strategic acquisitions like SmartRecruiters are further evidence of prioritizing long-term growth over short-term profitability. This strategy appears to be paying off, with a 35% surge in operating profit in the most recent quarter.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP's strong operating profit growth and expanding margins indicate a healthy financial position. The company's ability to fund acquisitions like SmartRecruiters without any mention of equity financing suggests that it has sufficient cash flow and borrowing capacity to support its growth initiatives. The proposed dividend increase for fiscal year 2024 further underscores the company's financial strength and commitment to returning capital to shareholders, making dilutive equity financing unlikely.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed both positive and negative aspects of the business. While celebrating strong growth, they also acknowledged "uncertainty in the global market, particularly in the U.S. public sector and industries impacted by trade tariffs," which could affect sales cycles. This willingness to discuss potential risks and challenges indicates a good level of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the provided search results to suggest a lack of integrity within SAP's management. The company's adherence to SEC filing requirements and its long history as a leading global software provider imply a commitment to ethical business practices. However, without a more in-depth review of corporate governance records and legal history, a definitive "Yes" cannot be given.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**Synthesis:**

SAP SE exhibits several strengths according to Fisher's 15 points, particularly in its long-term growth prospects, profitability, and commitment to innovation. The successful transition to a cloud-based model, strong sales organization, and industry-specific competitive advantages are key positives. However, the analysis is hampered by a lack of detailed information on R&D effectiveness, labor relations, and management depth, resulting in several "No" answers. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the successful integration of SmartRecruiters, the continued market adoption of Business AI, and the company's ability to navigate macroeconomic uncertainties. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness with the disclosure of specific performance metrics, and for the management-related points with more transparency on succession planning and executive team composition.

**fisher score is 10 / 15**
