### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On September 13, 2024, Laureate's Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program to acquire up to $100 million of the Company's common stock. As of June 30, 2025, approximately $27.4 million of the authorization remained available.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can signal to the market that management believes the stock is undervalued. This can lead to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** The stock repurchase program does not have a fixed expiration date. The remaining authorization could be completed within the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: The company repurchases an additional $10 million of stock.
    *   Base: The company completes the remaining $27.4 million authorization.
    *   High: The company completes the current authorization and announces a new program.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (0-10%). While repurchases provide support for the stock, the remaining authorization is a small percentage of the company's market capitalization.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has been actively repurchasing shares under this program.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must have sufficient free cash flow and a stock price that management deems attractive for repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for updates on the repurchase program.
    *   Press releases announcing any new repurchase authorizations.
    *   Daily trading volume and stock price.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   A deterioration in business performance could reduce the cash available for repurchases.
    *   Management could decide to allocate capital to other priorities.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases as an indicator of management's confidence in the business.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Organic Enrollment Growth in Mexico and Peru
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Laureate's strategy focuses on organic growth through adding new programs, expanding to new demographics, and increasing capacity at existing and new campuses. The company has seen recent enrollment growth in both Mexico and Peru.
*   **Mechanism:** Enrollment is the primary driver of revenue for Laureate. Stronger-than-expected enrollment growth would lead to higher revenue and earnings, which would likely drive the stock price higher.
*   **Timing:** Enrollment data is typically reported in the company's quarterly earnings releases. The next key intake periods are in the first and third quarters of the calendar year.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: Enrollment growth of 1-3%.
    *   Base: Enrollment growth of 4-6%.
    *   High: Enrollment growth of 7% or more.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). A significant beat on enrollment expectations could have a material impact on the stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has a demonstrated track record of enrollment growth, but it is subject to economic and competitive pressures.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   The economic environment in Mexico and Peru must remain stable.
    *   The company must successfully launch new programs and attract students.
    *   The competitive landscape must not become significantly more challenging.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly enrollment figures reported in earnings releases.
    *   Management commentary on enrollment trends during earnings calls.
    *   Economic data for Mexico and Peru.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   An economic downturn in Mexico or Peru could reduce demand for higher education.
    *   Increased competition from other private or public institutions could pressure enrollments.
    *   Regulatory changes could impact the company's ability to operate or expand.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Closely monitor enrollment trends and the economic backdrop in Latin America.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Divestiture of Non-Core Assets (K-12 campuses)
*   **Type:** M&A
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Laureate has classified its K-12 educational programs in Mexico as held for sale. The sale of these assets would allow the company to focus on its core higher education business.
*   **Mechanism:** The sale of non-core assets could generate cash that could be used for share repurchases, debt reduction, or investment in the core business. It could also simplify the business and make it more attractive to investors.
*   **Timing:** The timing of a potential sale is uncertain, but it could occur within the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: The assets are sold for a price that is at or below their carrying value.
    *   Base: The assets are sold for a modest premium to their carrying value.
    *   High: The assets are sold for a significant premium, and the proceeds are used for a large share repurchase.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (0-10%). The K-12 assets are a small part of the overall business, so the impact of a sale is likely to be limited.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The assets are classified as held for sale, which indicates a high likelihood of a sale, but the timing and price are uncertain.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   The company must find a buyer for the assets at an attractive price.
    *   The transaction must receive any necessary regulatory approvals.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Press releases announcing a sale of the K-12 assets.
    *   Updates in quarterly and annual reports on the status of the assets held for sale.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The company may not be able to find a buyer for the assets.
    *   The assets could be sold for a price that is below their carrying value, resulting in a loss.
    *   The sale could be delayed or blocked by regulators.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. A successful sale of these assets would be a modest positive for the stock.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Expansion of Online and Hybrid Education Programs
*   **Type:** Operational/Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Laureate intends to increase the number of students in fully online or hybrid programs to meet growing demand. The company has a common learning management system implemented across its universities and is targeting 40-60% of student credit hours to be taken online.
*   **Mechanism:** Online and hybrid programs can be more scalable and profitable than traditional campus-based programs. An expansion of these programs could lead to higher margins and a better return on invested capital, which would justify a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** This is a multi-year initiative that will unfold over the next 12-60 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low: The company is unable to significantly increase the penetration of online and hybrid programs.
    *   Base: The company reaches its target of 40-60% of credit hours being taken online.
    *   High: The company exceeds its target and is able to successfully launch new, high-margin online programs.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). A successful expansion of online and hybrid programs could have a significant impact on the company's profitability and valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a clear strategy and has already made investments in this area, but execution will be key.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   The company's online and hybrid programs must be of high quality and meet the needs of students.
    *   The regulatory environment in Mexico and Peru must remain supportive of online education.
    *   The company must be able to compete effectively with other online education providers.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Management commentary on the growth of online and hybrid programs.
    *   Data on the percentage of credit hours taken online.
    *   The launch of new online programs.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Students may prefer traditional campus-based education.
    *   The company's online offerings may not be competitive with those of other providers.
    *   Regulatory changes could restrict the growth of online education.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a key long-term driver for the company, and investors should monitor its progress closely.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Organic Enrollment Growth:**
*   **Base Case:** 5% enrollment growth. This would likely lead to a similar increase in revenue, and with operating leverage, a slightly higher increase in EBITDA.
*   **Upside Case:** 10% enrollment growth. This could lead to a 10% increase in revenue and a 15-20% increase in EBITDA, which could justify a 20-30% higher stock price.

**2. Expansion of Online and Hybrid Programs:**
*   **Base Case:** The company reaches its 40-60% target for online credit hours, leading to a modest margin improvement.
*   **Upside Case:** The company exceeds its target and successfully launches new online programs, leading to a 200-300 basis point improvement in EBITDA margins. This could increase EBITDA by 10-15% and justify a 15-25% higher stock price.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Laureate are modestly positive. The share repurchase program provides support for the stock, and continued enrollment growth is a key driver. The potential sale of the K-12 assets is a small positive. However, there are also risks, including economic weakness in Latin America and increased competition. The short-term market signal is neutral to slightly positive.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A severe economic downturn in Mexico and Peru:** This could lead to a sharp decline in enrollment and revenue, which would likely cause the stock price to fall.
2.  **A major regulatory change:** The company is subject to a complex and changing regulatory environment in the countries where it operates. A new law or regulation that restricts the company's ability to operate or expand could have a material adverse effect on the business.
3.  **A significant increase in competition:** The higher education markets in Mexico and Peru are competitive. An increase in competition from other private or public institutions could pressure enrollments and pricing.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Laureate Education presents a mixed but slightly positive catalyst profile. The most important near-term catalyst is continued organic enrollment growth in Mexico and Peru, which could drive a 10-30% upside in the stock price. The share repurchase program provides a floor for the stock. The key indicator to monitor is the quarterly enrollment data.
