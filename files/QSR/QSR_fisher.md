Company: Restaurant Brands International Inc. (QSR)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Q1 2025 Form 10-Q (filed May 8, 2025), 2024 Form 10-K summary (filed February 21, 2025), Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RBI has a significant runway for growth, primarily through international expansion and revitalization of its core US market. The company operates over 32,000 restaurants in more than 120 countries, with its international segment demonstrating strong performance, including 6.2% net restaurant growth and 8.6% system-wide sales growth for the trailing twelve months ended March 31, 2025. Management has identified a long-term opportunity to grow to 40,000 restaurants. The company is also making substantial investments in its largest brand, Burger King U.S., through its "Reclaim the Flame" program to improve store quality and operations, suggesting potential for market share recapture.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to reinvestment and development. The company is executing a multi-year "Reclaim the Flame" plan, investing up to $700 million through 2028 in Burger King for advertising, digital enhancements, and remodels. Furthermore, RBI acquired Carrols Restaurant Group in May 2024 for approximately $1 billion to accelerate the reimaging of over 1,000 Burger King locations before refranchising them. This, along with the recent acquisitions of the master franchisees for Popeyes and Burger King in China, shows a clear strategy of taking direct control to fix and grow key markets before returning to a capital-light franchise model.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a restaurant company, "R&D" is better measured by menu innovation, marketing effectiveness, and technology adoption. While QSR does not disclose a formal R&D budget, its effectiveness appears mixed. The international segment shows strong results with comparable sales growth of 2.6% in Q1 2025. However, in the crucial U.S. market, Burger King and Popeyes saw comparable sales decline by 1.3% and 4.0%, respectively, in the same period, suggesting that recent marketing and menu initiatives have not yet gained sufficient traction against competitors. The heavy investment in digital and restaurant technology under the "Reclaim the Flame" program is the key initiative to watch for future effectiveness.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In a franchise system, the "sales organization" is its network of franchisees and the marketing that drives customer traffic. QSR's performance is bifurcated. The international franchise network is performing well, with 6.2% net restaurant growth in the year ending Q1 2025. However, the U.S. market, particularly for Burger King, has underperformed for years, leading to the company acquiring its largest franchisee (Carrols) to directly overhaul operations and locations before selling them back to a hopefully stronger, more committed franchisee base. This large-scale, costly intervention indicates the existing "sales organization" in the U.S. was not above average.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, RBI maintains strong profit margins consistent with its capital-light franchise model. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company's income from operations was $435 million on $2.11 billion in revenue, for an operating margin of 20.6%. This is lower than the 31.3% margin in the prior-year period, a decline attributable to the consolidation of lower-margin company-owned restaurants from the Carrols acquisition. While lower than McDonald's (which reported a 45% operating margin in 2024), it is broadly competitive with other highly franchised peers like Yum! Brands (31.8% in 2024).
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGuhw10D-v7a5Hy79D8G8KRIo4NnlipWijXQmdUWLvzYtYzjbZ2f4rjLMeXgGzEgmLsoEZLpHvDc3Qwv6s_MY6NBITKSjt2t_XQDPJcy67zJQvunQGuSjjJO6Llfueka1HNldHIFN-a3VrNZmG5PiGQmpO0I6EMtzBZClBa56hmCoTyyyLHYTd5VI-UJ9gG8E0md-_34A8P0jFXu0HWzJ3Ipg8Jyk_Q_ANDOrlowgnx1zA= (August 19, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEEY8fgRZzhmXYwqt3KCyGbLQNsdYLdKsBvKECA0ZMDxad_qwFIGu4dM89EI9utkTSX-xlYZjzHcr9JwWNLtM9hvH0JpZ-KmEICxTm2iGBnP2p2Asib60NDGq0ct-s96Qn0S-tUB_sFCGJGjmHp45hqnKmjjXJeM9shhs8CYRbhT6OUJi23kntPT0UaJYAz6CCEy1GBvRYYWFcdD1TZcYeqB6CkP2GLMctU7YvTdrpVfMqZ (April 7, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary long-term margin improvement strategy is refranchising. RBI is temporarily taking on lower-margin company-owned stores through the Carrols acquisition with the explicit goal of improving their operations and then selling them, which will return the segment to a higher-margin royalty-based revenue stream. In its established franchised businesses, margin drivers include leveraging scale in the supply chain, exercising pricing power at the restaurant level, and growing royalty streams from international unit growth. The company also uses interest rate swaps to manage the cost of its debt.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a 90%+ franchised business, most labor relations occur at the franchisee level. However, at the corporate and brand level, there are some concerns. The company is defending a consolidated class action lawsuit alleging that an employee no-solicitation and no-hiring clause in its standard franchise agreements violated the Sherman Act. An appellate court reversed a lower court's dismissal of the case in August 2022, allowing it to proceed. While the outcome is unknown, the existence of such litigation suggests relations are not "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent changes at the top of the organization suggest a period of transition rather than stable, outstanding relations. Joshua Kobza was appointed CEO in March 2023, succeeding José Cil. Patrick Doyle, a highly respected industry veteran, was brought in as Executive Chairman in late 2022 to mentor the new CEO and drive a cultural and operational turnaround, particularly at Burger King. While Doyle's involvement is a positive, the need for such a change points to previous underperformance and a lack of stability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [Publicly available corporate leadership information.]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RBI operates with a decentralized structure, with dedicated leadership for each of its four main brands, in addition to the corporate executive team. Key leaders include Tom Curtis (President, Burger King U.S. & Canada), Axel Schwan (Regional President, Tim Hortons Canada & U.S.), and Sami Siddiqui (Chief Financial Officer). The hiring of Patrick Doyle as Executive Chairman also adds a layer of deep industry experience at the highest level. This structure provides a clear line of command and accountability for each brand.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [Publicly available corporate leadership information.]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's accounting controls appear robust. The Q1 2025 10-Q filing states that management, including the CEO and CFO, concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of March 31, 2025. The 2024 10-K, filed February 21, 2025, contained an unqualified opinion from its auditor on the effectiveness of internal controls. The company has also recently enhanced its segment reporting to separately show the results of its company-owned "Restaurant Holdings" (RH) segment, increasing transparency into its temporary restaurant ownership strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key clue in the QSR industry is franchisee health and alignment, as it dictates the pace of remodels, operational execution, and brand image. RBI’s decision to spend over $1 billion to acquire and remodel Carrols' Burger King restaurants is a massive, and unusual, investment for a franchisor. It is a tacit admission that the previous, purely hands-off franchise model was failing to maintain competitive standards in its most important market. The success or failure of this "fix-and-flip" strategy for franchisees will be a powerful clue to RBI's long-term standing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is clearly prioritizing long-range profits. The "Reclaim the Flame" and Carrols acquisition strategies are multi-year plans that are depressing short-term margins and requiring significant capital investment. The acquisition of 1,022 restaurants from Carrols temporarily lowered RBI's operating margin from 31.3% in Q1 2024 to 20.6% in Q1 2025. Management is explicitly trading near-term profitability and capital for the long-term goal of a healthier, more competitive, and faster-growing Burger King brand in the U.S.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** RBI's financial position appears sufficient to fund growth without dilutive equity financing. The company generates substantial operating cash flow ($118 million in the seasonally weaker Q1 2025). Major investments like the Carrols acquisition were funded with cash on hand and debt. The company also has a share repurchase program in place, with authorization to buy back up to $1 billion in shares through September 2025 ($500 million remaining as of March 31, 2025), demonstrating a commitment to returning capital and preventing dilution, not causing it.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is reasonably candid about its challenges, particularly the need to improve the Burger King U.S. business. The extensive public discussion of the "Reclaim the Flame" plan, including its costs and objectives, and the rationale for the Carrols acquisition, are examples of this transparency. In earnings calls, executives have acknowledged the weak comparable sales figures in the U.S. and have detailed the specific operational and marketing steps they are taking to address them. The creation of a new reporting segment for the acquired restaurants further enhances transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no widespread scandals, but there are legal issues that prevent a score of "unquestionable." The company is currently defending two notable lawsuits. One is a class action regarding no-hire clauses in franchise agreements, which plaintiffs allege is anti-competitive. The other is a complaint from former Carrols shareholders alleging breach of fiduciary duty by RBI in its capacity as a controlling shareholder during the acquisition. While the company is vigorously defending these claims, they represent legitimate legal and governance challenges that question the company's practices.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1618756/000161875625000242/qsr-20250331.htm (May 8, 2025)]

---
**Synthesis**

Restaurant Brands International scores positively on its long-term strategic vision, commitment to reinvestment, and financial discipline. The company's strongest attributes are its clear runway for international growth and management's willingness to sacrifice near-term profits and margins to overhaul the underperforming Burger King U.S. system. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses in execution and relations. The core U.S. business for Burger King and Popeyes is struggling with negative same-store sales, and the company faces legal and governance challenges regarding its franchisee and shareholder relations. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the execution of the Burger King U.S. turnaround and the successful refranchising of the acquired Carrols restaurants. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on "R&D Effectiveness" would require sustained positive comparable sales in the U.S., while a resolution of the outstanding lawsuits would be needed to change the "Labor Relations" and "Unquestionable Integrity" scores.
