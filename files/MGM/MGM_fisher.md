**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MGM is pursuing several significant growth opportunities. The company is developing an integrated resort in Osaka, Japan, which will open up a new market. It is also expanding its digital presence through BetMGM and LeoVegas. Furthermore, there is a potential for a full-scale commercial gaming license in New York for its Empire City property. The company has also noted the potential for gaming expansion in the United Arab Emirates. These initiatives, particularly the expansion into new geographic markets like Japan and the growth of the digital gaming segment, provide a long runway for sales growth.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy explicitly includes investing in new growth opportunities. The company's 2024 10-K outlines a strategic plan focused on expanding its international and digital footprint, citing the development in Japan and the growth of BetMGM and LeoVegas as key initiatives. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in 2024, with plans for $1.1 to $1.2 billion in 2025, directed at remodels, technology, and gaming equipment, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing existing properties and investing in new technology. The company is also actively pursuing a commercial gaming license for Empire City in New York and is exploring opportunities in the UAE and Thailand.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MGM's R&D is not disclosed as a separate line item but is embedded in technology and development spending. The company's focus is on technology to enhance guest experience and digital gaming platforms. The 2024 10-K mentions the development of proprietary technology for its digital operations and the use of data analytics to personalize marketing. The acquisition of Angstrom technology for BetMGM is expected to improve the parlay product and increase hold. However, without specific R&D spending figures and direct ROI metrics, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness relative to its size and competitors.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a sophisticated marketing strategy that leverages its MGM Rewards loyalty program to capture guest preferences and drive personalized engagement. The marketing strategy is data-driven, using advanced analytics to segment customers and deliver targeted offers. The company utilizes a multi-channel approach including brand ambassadors, online, and direct outreach. The MGM Rewards program is a key tool for customer retention and increasing lifetime value by incentivizing customers across its properties and with BetMGM. The company's ability to attract and retain a diverse customer base, from premium gaming customers to large conventions, suggests a strong sales and marketing organization.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, MGM's consolidated operating margin was 8.6%. Segment-wise, Las Vegas Strip Resorts had an Adjusted EBITDAR margin of 35.2%, Regional Operations was 30.7%, and MGM China was 27.0%. In the first quarter of 2025, the Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment Adjusted EBITDAR margin was 37.3%, and the Regional Operations was 31.0%. These margins are substantial, particularly in the Las Vegas segment, which is the company's largest. The margins demonstrate the company's ability to generate significant profits from its operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000021/mgm-20250331.htm', April 30, 2025]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MGM is focused on operational excellence to improve efficiencies and increase margins. The company is refining its operating model by optimizing its Centers of Excellence and implementing cost-cutting initiatives in labor, sourcing, and revenue generation. It is also leveraging technology to enhance digital commerce and pricing, offering personalized packages and upsell opportunities. The company's asset-light strategy, which involves divesting real estate assets while retaining operations, is another key initiative to improve its financial profile.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, approximately 38,000 of MGM's domestic employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The company has several agreements expiring in 2025, which introduces some risk. However, the company emphasizes its commitment to its employees through various initiatives such as tuition reimbursement, student loan debt repayment, and leadership development programs. The company also highlights its focus on a "people-driven culture" and has been recognized as one of FORTUNE® Magazine's World's Most Admired Companies®. While the large unionized workforce presents potential for disputes, the company’s stated commitment and programs suggest good relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, as listed in the 2024 10-K, shows a mix of long-tenured executives and experienced leaders from other relevant industries. For example, William J. Hornbuckle has been with the company for many years in various roles before becoming CEO, and Jonathan S. Halkyard, the CFO, has extensive experience in the hospitality and gaming industries. There is no indication of significant executive turnover or public disputes. The executive team appears stable and experienced.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K lists a team of five executive officers, including the CEO, COO, CFO, Chief Legal and Administrative Officer, and President of MGM Resorts International Interactive. This indicates a clear division of responsibilities at the highest level. The company's structure with distinct reportable segments (Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, MGM China, and MGM Digital) suggests that there are layers of management with expertise in specific areas. While the 10-K does not provide details on succession planning, the presence of experienced executives across different functions and divisions indicates management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from their independent registered public accounting firm, which provides an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company's financial statements provide a detailed breakdown of revenues and expenses by segment. The company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MGM's "asset-light" strategy of owning the operations but not the real estate for its domestic properties is a key differentiator. This allows the company to redeploy capital towards growth initiatives and shareholder returns. The company's globally recognized brands (Bellagio, MGM Grand, Aria) and its prime locations on the Las Vegas Strip are significant competitive advantages. Furthermore, its loyalty program, MGM Rewards, creates a powerful network effect, encouraging customers to stay within the MGM ecosystem.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategic plan is focused on long-term value creation. The company is making significant long-term investments in Japan and New York, which will not generate profits for several years. The company is also investing heavily in its digital businesses, BetMGM and LeoVegas, which are in a high-growth phase and require significant investment to build market share. These investments demonstrate a willingness to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong focus on returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks. In 2024, the company repurchased $1.4 billion of its common stock. The company's Board of Directors authorized a new $2.0 billion share repurchase plan in April 2025. The company's ability to generate strong operating cash flow ($2.4 billion in 2024) and its access to debt markets suggest that it can fund its growth initiatives without resorting to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025], ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000021/mgm-20250331.htm', April 30, 2025]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed financial and operating data in its quarterly and annual reports. The "Risk Factors" section of the 2024 10-K provides a comprehensive overview of the risks facing the business, including the September 2023 cybersecurity issue and its potential impact. Management hosts quarterly earnings calls with analysts where they discuss results and answer questions. While it is difficult to definitively assess candor without being an investor, the level of disclosure in the SEC filings is high.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates in a highly regulated industry and must adhere to strict compliance standards. The 2024 10-K outlines the company's commitment to social impact and sustainability, including a dedicated board committee and a Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer. The company has a Code of Conduct that all employees are required to follow. While the company has faced legal proceedings, as disclosed in its filings, there is no evidence of widespread or systemic integrity issues at the management level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/789570/000078957025000008/mgm-20241231.htm', February 18, 2025]

Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
MGM Resorts International scores well on the Fisher checklist, with many positive attributes. The company's strengths lie in its long-term growth prospects through international expansion and digital gaming, its strong brand portfolio and marketing organization, and its solid financial position. The management team appears stable, experienced, and focused on long-term value creation. The primary area of weakness is the lack of specific disclosure on R&D effectiveness, which makes it difficult to assess its competitiveness in technology and innovation. Over the next 12-24 months, the key variables that could change the score are the progress of the Japan integrated resort development, the outcome of the New York gaming license application, and the continued growth and profitability of the digital segment. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosure on R&D spending and its returns.

fisher score is 14 / 15
