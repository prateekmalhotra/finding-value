### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

For the six months ended June 30, 2025, sales and marketing expenses were $820 million. The company's growth in merchants and GMV, along with the increasing adoption of Shopify Plus by larger brands, indicates an effective sales and marketing strategy.

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Shopify reported a gross profit of $2.471 billion, representing a gross margin of 49%. Income from operations was $494 million, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 9.8%. While the company has demonstrated the ability to generate profits, the gross margin has been influenced by the growing share of lower-margin merchant solutions revenue. However, the company views this as beneficial to operating margins in the long run, as these solutions require less sales and marketing and R&D expense.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000073/shop-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000073/shop-20250630.htm) (August 6, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's strategy for maintaining and improving profit margins involves a focus on scaling its operations efficiently and managing costs. The company's shift toward a remote-first work environment and its focus on disciplined hiring are aimed at controlling operating expenses. While the revenue mix is shifting towards lower-margin merchant solutions, Shopify believes this will be beneficial to operating margins over the long term. The company also continues to invest in higher-margin subscription solutions and enhance its Shopify Plus offerings for larger merchants, which can contribute to margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify emphasizes a culture of "world-class crafters" who are "merchant-obsessed." The company implemented a remote-first work environment and a flexible compensation system called "Flex Comp" to attract and retain talent. A 2024 company-wide employee survey indicated that nine out of ten respondents would recommend their team at Shopify to a friend. These initiatives and positive employee feedback suggest good labor and personnel relations. As of December 31, 2024, Shopify had approximately 8,100 employees.
**Answer:** Yes

While there have been changes in the executive team over time, the core leadership has remained consistent, providing stability and a clear long-term vision.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify has a well-defined executive team with clear roles and responsibilities.

**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's financial statements are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a reputable accounting firm, which has consistently issued unqualified opinions on the company's financial statements and internal controls over financial reporting. The company provides detailed breakdowns of its revenues, cost of revenues, and operating expenses in its public filings, indicating a good level of cost analysis and accounting control. The company's management has also concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000073/shop-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000073/shop-20250630.htm) (August 6, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's key competitive advantage lies in its extensive ecosystem of app developers, theme designers, and other partners. This ecosystem creates a network effect, where more merchants attract more developers, and more apps and themes attract more merchants. This deepens the platform's functionality and creates a moat that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's focus on providing a comprehensive, multi-channel commerce platform that is easy to use for merchants of all sizes is another key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's management has consistently communicated a focus on long-term value creation over short-term profitability. The company continues to make significant investments in R&D, sales and marketing, and new product development to drive future growth. In its 2024 10-K, the company states its focus is on "maximizing long-term value" and that strategic decisions may not maximize short-term revenue or profitability if they are consistent with the company's long-term mission. This long-range outlook is evident in the company's sustained investment in its platform and ecosystem.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1594805/000159480525000012/shop-20241231.htm) (February 11, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Shopify had $1.542 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $4.278 billion in marketable securities. The company has a strong balance sheet and has historically generated positive cash flow from operations. While the company has a shelf prospectus that allows it to offer new securities, its strong financial position and cash generation capabilities suggest it can fund its growth initiatives without significant equity dilution in the foreseeable future. The company has convertible senior notes due in 2025, which it has the option to settle in cash, shares, or a combination.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shopify's management team regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls, public filings, and investor presentations. The earnings call transcripts show a willingness to discuss challenges and the rationale behind strategic decisions, such as the sale of the logistics business in 2023. The company provides detailed financial information and key performance indicators, demonstrating a commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal or regulatory issues that would call into question the integrity of Shopify's management. The company's public filings do not indicate any material related-party transactions, audit issues, or governance red flags that would be of concern. The company has a Code of Conduct that applies to all employees and directors, and it maintains a transparent and professional relationship with its stakeholders.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Shopify scores highly on Fisher's 15-point checklist, with strong positives in its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and robust ecosystem. The company's management appears to have a clear long-range vision and has demonstrated a willingness to make strategic decisions for durable growth. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to maintain its growth trajectory in a competitive market, the continued success of its Shopify Plus and international expansion strategies, and its ability to manage operating expenses effectively to improve profitability. A significant slowdown in GMV growth or a failure to innovate and adapt to the evolving e-commerce landscape could turn some "Yes" answers to "No". Conversely, continued strong growth and margin improvement would solidify the company's high Fisher score.

fisher score is 15 / 15
