| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (assumed based on current 10-year Treasury yield)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0%
    *   **Beta:** 1.2 (assumed for a small-cap company in a regulated industry)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.2 \* 5.0% = 10.25%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Interest Expense / Total Debt = $0.12M / $0.69M = 17.4%**
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 17.4% \* (1 - 26.96%) = 12.7%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Market Cap = 11.77M shares \* $12.35/share = $145.36M**
    *   **WACC = (145.36 / (145.36 + 0.69)) \* 10.25% + (0.69 / (145.36 + 0.69)) \* 12.7% = 10.2%**

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

*   **Gordon Growth Model:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (long-run inflation expectation)
    *   **Terminal Value = $7.76 \* (1.025) / (0.102 - 0.025) = $103.21M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = $17.76M + $0.78M = $18.54M**
    *   **Terminal Value (7.0x Multiple) = $18.54M \* 7.0 = $129.78M**
    *   The lower Gordon Growth value of $103.21M is used.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** $21.97M
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $63.78M
*   **Enterprise Value:** $85.75M
*   **Equity Value:** $85.75M - ($0.69M - $10.38M) = $95.44M

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** $95.44M / 11.77M shares = **$8.11**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($5.50):** Assumes lower revenue growth (10%), margin compression (12% operating margin), and a higher discount rate (12%).
    *   **High/Bull Case ($12.50):** Assumes higher revenue growth (20%), slight margin expansion (16% operating margin), and a lower discount rate (9.5%).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** 30% below Base-Case = **$5.68**

### Risk Notes

This valuation is subject to several risks. Regulatory changes, especially concerning Title IV funding and the 90/10 rule, could materially affect revenue and profitability. Increased competition could pressure enrollments and margins. The company's success in integrating acquisitions and expanding into new markets is a key uncertainty. The valuation is also sensitive to assumptions about beta and the equity risk premium.
