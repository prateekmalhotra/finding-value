### **3) Guidance Extracts**

*   **Revenue Growth:** "For 2025, we reported revenue growth of 12.7%..." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug. 7, 2025).
*   **Margin Targets:** "Restaurant margin as a percentage of total sales decreased 108 basis points year over year to 17.1%." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug. 7, 2025).
*   **Capex Outlook:** In 2025, we expect capital expenditures of approximately $400 million. (2024 10-K, p. 47, Feb. 28, 2025)
*   **Inflation:** "Updated full-year commodity inflation guidance to approximately 5% for fiscal 2025... Lowered full-year wage and labor inflation guidance to approximately 4% for fiscal 2025..." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug. 7, 2025).

### **4) Forecast & Assumptions**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** Base case starts at 10% in Year 1, conservatively below the Q2 2025 growth of 12.7%, and fades to 4% by Year 5. This is a conservative assumption based on the provided guidance.
*   **Operating Margin:** Assumed to be 10.0% for all 5 years. This is a conservative assumption, slightly below the TTM operating margin and held flat.
*   **Taxes:** 15.5% effective tax rate, within the company's guided range of 15-16%. (2024 10-K, p. 45, Feb. 28, 2025)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** $400 million in Year 1 as guided, then growing at 4% annually.
    *   **Working Capital:** Assumed to be a 1.0% use of cash relative to the change in revenue.
    *   **D&A:** Projected to grow slightly slower than revenue, from $190M in Year 1 to $225M in Year 5.
*   **SBC and Dilution:** Stock-based compensation is treated as a real cash expense and is subtracted from FCFF.

### **5) Free Cash Flow Build**

*   **FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation

| Year | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FCFF (M)** | **$105.8** | **$124.7** | **$158.0** | **$195.9** | **$239.1** |

### **6) Discount Rate**

*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.3% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug. 20, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** 6.0% (Conservative estimate).
*   **Beta:** 1.0 (Conservative assumption for a restaurant chain).
*   **Cost of Equity:** 10.3% = 4.3% + 1.0 * 6.0%
*   **Cost of Debt:** Not applicable as the company has no debt.
*   **WACC:** 10.3%

### **7) Terminal Value**

*   **Method:** Gordon Growth Model
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 3.0% (Conservative long-term growth assumption).
*   **Terminal Value:** $4,120M = ($239.1M * (1 + 0.03)) / (0.103 - 0.03)
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** Terminal Value implies a P/E of approximately 8.6x, which is a conservative multiple.

### **9) Per-Share Valuation**

### **10) One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key downside risks to this valuation include: (1) a significant downturn in the casual dining sector, which could compress margins and reduce customer traffic; (2) higher-than-expected commodity and labor inflation, which would directly impact profitability; (3) failure to achieve guided store growth and revenue targets, which would result in lower-than-projected cash flows; and (4) a significant increase in interest rates, which would increase the discount rate and lower the present value of future cash flows.

final answer is 37.85 $
