The Cheesecake Factory Incorporated (CAKE), analyzed August 22, 2025. Primary sources reviewed include the 2024 10-K, Q1 and Q2 2025 10-Q filings, and Q2 2025 earnings call transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has significant unit growth potential across its portfolio. Management targets expanding The Cheesecake Factory to approximately 300 domestic locations, North Italia to 200, and Flower Child up to 700. This planned expansion is supported by the large and growing U.S. fast-casual and casual dining markets, with the fast-casual segment alone projected to grow significantly. The company's diverse portfolio allows it to capture various dining occasions and consumer preferences.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Cheesecake Factory demonstrates a commitment to ongoing development through regular menu innovation, updating its extensive menu twice annually to adapt to consumer trends. Furthermore, the company operates Fox Restaurant Concepts (FRC) as an independent subsidiary and concept incubator, tasked with creating and developing new restaurant brands. This dual approach of refining existing concepts and actively creating new ones indicates a clear determination to drive future sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a restaurant operator, R&D is primarily menu and concept innovation. The company's ability to maintain high unit volumes (average sales per location for The Cheesecake Factory were $12.4 million in fiscal 2024) with a menu of approximately 225 items demonstrates effective R&D in creating popular and profitable dishes. The successful expansion of acquired concepts like North Italia and the role of FRC as a concept incubator also point to effective development efforts relative to its size in the industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales and marketing strategy relies on brand reputation and high-profile locations rather than traditional advertising. The national launch of the Cheesecake Rewards® program in mid-2023 is a key initiative to leverage data to engage with guests and drive sales. Average sales per restaurant and per square foot for The Cheesecake Factory are among the highest in the publicly-held full-service restaurant industry, indicating a highly effective sales approach at the unit level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, the company's income from operations was 5.0% of revenues. While this is a respectable margin, it can be subject to pressure from commodity and wage inflation, which are significant factors in the restaurant industry. The company's large, complex menu and scratch-kitchen model, while a competitive advantage, also create margin pressures due to higher labor and food costs compared to some competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management actively works to mitigate cost pressures. The company's philosophy is to use menu price increases to help offset key operating cost increases, as seen with price increases above historical levels in recent years to combat inflation. Additionally, the company regularly reviews menu offerings and ingredients to manage product costs and leverages its scale in purchasing to achieve efficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong record in employee relations, evidenced by its inclusion in Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work For®" list for twelve consecutive years as of 2025. The 2024 10-K notes that as of December 31, 2024, none of its staff members were covered by collective bargaining agreements. The company also emphasizes its comprehensive training, internal promotion, and benefits programs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm', 'https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHW7vDcWFygzjKgXcPMH7qJjKGE777qaiK9ax41Z6cXBhPZrvc_361fBVDm8tUwq912WWD_i89ddg6LAZgNBnJzfs88f982ydV5ygIedDgfwO5cumTlphE8C8_Xu7EmCo6Ppf_ZHeBkRtni']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team demonstrates stability and experience. David Overton, the founder, remains Chairman and CEO. David Gordon, the President, joined the company in 1993, and Matthew Clark, the CFO, joined in 2006. This long tenure among key leadership suggests a stable and cohesive executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a multi-layered management structure beyond the C-suite. Key operational and brand leadership roles are highlighted in the 10-K, including a President for The Cheesecake Factory Bakery Incorporated. The company's succession plan is mentioned as a key mitigator of executive risk, indicating a focus on developing a bench of talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, which states that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's own report also concluded that internal controls were effective. There is no history of major restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Cheesecake Factory's vertically integrated bakery operation is a significant competitive advantage. It provides control over the quality and innovation of its signature dessert line while also serving as a profitable separate business channel selling to third parties. This integration is unique among its casual dining peers and strengthens its brand identity. The extensive menu, prepared from scratch, is another key differentiator that drives customer traffic and loyalty.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently articulates a long-term growth strategy. The 2024 10-K outlines a financial objective of 13% to 14% total shareholder return on average over the long term, based on unit growth, sales growth, and margin expansion. The continued investment in developing emerging brands like North Italia and Flower Child, which have lower current margins but significant growth potential, demonstrates a willingness to invest for the long term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary source of liquidity is cash flow from operations, which was $268.3 million in fiscal 2024. This is sufficient to cover capital expenditures, which are projected to be $190 million to $210 million in fiscal 2025. The company also has a share repurchase program in place, which further mitigates the risk of dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Review of recent earnings call transcripts, such as for Q2 2025, shows management addressing challenges directly. For example, they discussed specific traffic softness in the second quarter and detailed the inflationary pressures on margins, while also outlining their strategies to manage these issues. This transparency in discussing both positive and negative trends demonstrates a commitment to candid communication.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence from public filings or major news sources of significant legal or regulatory actions against the company's senior management that would call their integrity into question. The 2024 10-K details the company's code of ethics and its commitment to corporate governance. The long tenure of the executive team and the company's consistent recognition as a top employer further support a culture of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/887596/000141057825000195/cake-20241231x10k.htm']

Synthesis:
The Cheesecake Factory scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting a stable, well-managed company with a strong brand and a clear path for future growth through its diverse portfolio of restaurant concepts. The primary strengths lie in its long runway for unit expansion, commitment to innovation, strong company culture and labor relations, and experienced management team. The only negative score relates to profit margins, which, while positive, are susceptible to the inherent pressures of the casual dining industry, such as food and labor inflation. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company can demonstrate sustained margin expansion through its pricing power, operational efficiencies, and purchasing scale. A key variable to watch will be the unit economics and sales momentum of the emerging North Italia and Flower Child brands, as their successful, high-return growth is critical to the company's long-term shareholder return targets and would flip the margin score to "Yes".

fisher score is 14 / 15
