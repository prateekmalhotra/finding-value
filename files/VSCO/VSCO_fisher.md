---
Synthesis: The analysis shows a company in transition. The strongest positives are in areas of management and financial stability. The company has a clear plan for margin improvement, good executive relations, and a solid balance sheet with low risk of equity dilution. The most significant negatives are related to the company's current business performance and competitive positioning. Declining sales, weak profit margins, and the ongoing brand repositioning in a competitive market present major challenges. The Fisher score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of the brand transformation and the effectiveness of the cost-cutting and profit improvement plan. A sustained increase in comparable sales and an improvement in profit margins would be the key evidence to flip the "No" answers to "Yes".

fisher score is 10 / 15
