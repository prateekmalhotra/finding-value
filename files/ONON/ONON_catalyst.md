### **Timeline / Gantt**

| Catalyst | Q3 2025 | Q4 2025 | Q1 2026 | Q2 2026 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |

### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Continued DTC Channel Growth and Margin Expansion:**
*   **Base Case:** If On's DTC mix reaches 45% of sales and this leads to a 150 basis point improvement in gross margin, and assuming a constant P/E multiple, the stock could see a **15-20%** upside.
*   **Formula:** (New Gross Profit / Old Gross Profit) - 1

**2. Margin Expansion Towards 18%+ Adjusted EBITDA Target:**
*   **Base Case:** If On achieves an 18.5% adjusted EBITDA margin on projected 2026 revenues and the stock trades at a conservative 20x EV/EBITDA multiple, this could imply a **30-40%** upside from current levels.
*   **Formula:** ((Projected 2026 Revenue * 0.185 * 20) - Net Debt) / Shares Outstanding

### **Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for On Holding AG is positive. The company is experiencing strong momentum in its DTC channel and in the APAC region, which should continue to drive top-line growth and margin expansion. The upcoming launch of new product lines provides an additional potential upside catalyst. The primary risk is a potential slowdown in consumer spending due to macroeconomic headwinds.

### **Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Global Recession:** A significant economic downturn would likely lead to a sharp reduction in consumer spending on discretionary items like premium sportswear.
2.  **Major Supply Chain Disruption:** On relies on third-party manufacturers, primarily in Asia. Any major disruption to its supply chain could have a material impact on its ability to meet demand.
3.  **Shift in Consumer Preferences:** The sportswear market is highly competitive and subject to changing fashion trends. A shift in consumer preferences away from the On brand could have a significant negative impact on sales.

### **Final Recommendation Paragraph**

On Holding AG presents a compelling growth story with a strong portfolio of near- and long-term catalysts. The most significant near-term driver is the continued expansion of the high-margin DTC channel, which could lead to a **10-25%** upside in the share price over the next 12 months. Investors should closely monitor the company's quarterly reports for progress on DTC sales and gross profit margins.
