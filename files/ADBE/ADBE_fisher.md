### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway

**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's total addressable market (TAM) is projected to reach $293 billion in 2027, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13% from 2024. This growth is driven by the increasing demand for digital content and experiences, accelerated by the adoption of AI. The company is capitalizing on this by integrating its Firefly generative AI across its product suite, which is expected to add over $4 billion to its TAM. Adobe's long-term revenue target is $30 billion, indicating a clear runway for growth.

**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe has a strong financial position with significant cash flow from operations ($8.06 billion in fiscal 2024). The company has a consistent history of share buybacks, having repurchased $9.5 billion of its stock in fiscal 2024, which more than offsets the dilutive effect of stock-based compensation. With a new $25 billion share repurchase authorization in place, the company is well-positioned to continue returning capital to shareholders and fund growth without significant equity dilution.

**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's investor relations website provides transparent access to quarterly results, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations. During earnings calls, management addresses analyst questions directly, even when they touch on challenging topics like the cost of AI services or competitive pressures. CEO Shantanu Narayen has also publicly addressed concerns about the company's stock performance, demonstrating a willingness to engage with investors during periods of underperformance.

**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed a lawsuit against Adobe and two of its executives in June 2024, alleging that the company deceived consumers by hiding early termination fees and making it difficult to cancel subscriptions. This legal action, which alleges violations of the Restore Online Shoppers' Confidence Act, raises questions about the company's transparency and business practices. While Adobe has stated its intention to dispute the allegations, the lawsuit itself is a significant mark against the company's integrity.

**Answer:** No

### Synthesis

Adobe scores well on most of Fisher's 15 points, demonstrating a strong market position, a commitment to innovation, and a healthy financial profile. The company's strategic focus on AI and its dominant ecosystem of creative and marketing software provide a long runway for growth. However, the recent FTC lawsuit regarding its subscription practices casts a shadow over the company's integrity and is the primary reason for a "No" on that point. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the resolution of the FTC lawsuit and the continued execution of its AI strategy. A favorable settlement or dismissal of the lawsuit, coupled with strong monetization of its AI products, could lead to a higher score. Conversely, a negative outcome in the lawsuit or a failure to maintain its competitive edge in the face of AI-driven disruption could lower the score. To flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes," Adobe would need to resolve the FTC lawsuit in a way that demonstrates a commitment to transparent and customer-friendly practices.

fisher score is 14 / 15
