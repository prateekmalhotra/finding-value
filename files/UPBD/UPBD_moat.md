The initial search clarifies Upbound Group's business. It's not a SaaS company, but a financial services company focused on the lease-to-own market through brands like Rent-A-Center and Acima. It also has a financial wellness app, Brigit. This contradicts one of the search results that suggested a software-based revenue model with subscription and licensing fees, so I will ignore that part. The core business is providing access to consumer goods for underserved customers.

Now, I'll search for the latest SEC filings. The prompt's URLs were for the future, so I need to find the most recently *filed* documents. I'll search for "Upbound Group Inc. SEC filings".The search results point me to several recent filings. The most important ones for this analysis will be the latest 10-K (annual report) and 10-Q (quarterly report). I see from the search results that a 10-Q was filed on July 31, 2025. I will search for the link to that 10-Q and the most recent 10-K. I'll also look for an earnings call transcript around the same date.I have found the key documents. I will prioritize the 2024 10-K for a comprehensive overview and long-term data, and the Q2 2025 10-Q and earnings call transcript for the most recent performance and management commentary.

Now I will browse the 2024 10-K to extract information for the moat analysis. I'll be looking for details on their business segments, competition, risks, and any metrics that map to the 10 moat dimensions.
I seem to have been blocked from accessing the SEC website directly. This is a common issue. I will try a different approach. I will try a targeted search for specific information within the 10-K from a cached version if possible. I will start with a search to understand their distribution network and scale, which is a key part of the "Distribution & Efficient Scale" dimension.I've gathered enough preliminary information to begin the formal assessment. I have data on the company's business model, its segments (Rent-A-Center, Acima, and Brigit), and some key financial metrics from its recent earnings release. I also have details on its physical store footprint from the 10-K. I will now proceed with the structured analysis, addressing each of the 10 moat dimensions as requested. I will synthesize the information I've found and cite it appropriately.

---

**1) Network Effects**
- **Reasoning:** Upbound's core lease-to-own businesses (Rent-A-Center and Acima) do not exhibit strong network effects. While Acima operates a partner network with retailers, the value proposition is primarily to the retailer (access to more customers) and the customer (access to goods), not creating a user-to-user network. The addition of a new customer does not materially improve the service for existing customers.
- **Evidence:**
    - The business model is described as a platform facilitating consumer transactions through store-based and digital channels, not a network-based model. (Upbound Group, Inc. Q2 2025 Earnings Release, July 31, 2025)
- **Score:** 1 / 5

**2) Switching Costs**
- **Reasoning:** Switching costs are moderate. While customers are contractually obligated for the term of their lease, these are typically short-term agreements. The primary switching cost is the inconvenience of returning a product and starting a new lease with a competitor, but there are no significant technical or financial barriers to doing so once a lease term is complete.
- **Evidence:**
    - The business is based on lease-to-own agreements for durable goods, which are by nature shorter-term than long-term service contracts. (Upbound Group, Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2024)
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
- **Reasoning:** Upbound may have some scale advantages in procurement and logistics, given its large footprint. However, the business is competitive, and there is no clear evidence of a structural cost advantage that allows for sustainably lower prices or higher margins than all competitors. Gross margins improved in the Rent-A-Center business, but the company also faces top-line pressure, suggesting a difficult competitive environment. (Earnings call transcript: Upbound Group Q2 2025 beats EPS forecast, stock dips, July 31, 2025)
- **Evidence:**
    - The company has a large national footprint, which could provide some economies of scale in purchasing and distribution. (Upbound Group, Inc. Form 10-K, February 27, 2024)
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
- **Reasoning:** The company operates well-established brands in the lease-to-own space, particularly Rent-A-Center. However, brand loyalty in this segment is likely secondary to price and convenience. There is no mention of significant patents or proprietary technology that would create a strong, defensible moat.
- **Evidence:**
    - The company's primary brands are Acima, Brigit, and Rent-A-Center, which are well-known in their respective niches. (Upbound Group, Inc. Q2 2025 Earnings Release, July 31, 2025)
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
- **Reasoning:** This is one of Upbound's stronger dimensions. The combination of the Acima network within third-party retail stores and the extensive footprint of company-owned Rent-A-Center stores creates a significant distribution network that would be costly and time-consuming for a new entrant to replicate. The physical store network provides a logistical advantage for fulfillment and returns.
- **Evidence:**
    - As of December 31, 2023, the company operated 1,839 company-owned Rent-A-Center stores in the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and 131 stores in Mexico. (Form 10-K for Upbound Group INC filed 02/27/2024, February 27, 2024)
    - The Acima segment offers lease-to-own solutions through a wide network of third-party retailers. (Form 10-K for Upbound Group INC filed 02/27/2024, February 27, 2024)
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**6) Data Advantage**
- **Reasoning:** Upbound processes a large volume of applications from underserved consumers, which gives it a substantial dataset for underwriting and risk assessment. This data helps refine its decisioning models, which is a competitive advantage. However, the extent to which this data is proprietary and defensible against competitors who also have access to alternative data sources is not fully clear.
- **Evidence:**
    - The company describes itself as a "technology and data-driven leader," suggesting that data analytics are core to its operations. (Upbound Group, Inc. Q2 2025 Earnings Release, July 31, 2025)
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
- **Reasoning:** The Acima business model has some ecosystem characteristics, connecting retailers with consumers. However, it is primarily a two-sided platform, not a multi-faceted ecosystem where third parties are building businesses on top of Upbound's platform. The value is transactional rather than creating a sticky, integrated ecosystem.
- **Evidence:**
    - The Acima segment enables retail partners to offer lease-to-own solutions, creating a B2B2C relationship. (Form 10-K for Upbound Group INC filed 02/27/2024, February 27, 2024)
- **Score:** 1 / 5

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
- **Reasoning:** The lease-to-own industry is subject to a complex web of state and federal regulations. While compliance creates a barrier to entry for smaller, less sophisticated players, these regulations do not provide Upbound with an exclusive right to operate. Navigating these legal requirements is a cost of doing business rather than a source of a durable competitive advantage.
- **Evidence:**
    - The business is subject to various state and federal laws governing consumer lending and leasing. The 10-K details operations in states like Wisconsin and New Jersey where the business model must be adapted to comply with specific retail installment sales acts. (Upbound Group, Inc. - 10K - Annual Report - February 24, 2023, February 24, 2023)
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
- **Reasoning:** Building out a national network of nearly 2,000 retail stores requires significant capital investment, creating a barrier to entry. The inventory of durable goods also represents a substantial capital outlay. These assets, while not entirely specialized, are specific to the lease-to-own business model, making it a capital-intensive industry to enter at scale.
- **Evidence:**
    - The company operates over 2,400 company-branded retail units, which represents a significant physical asset base. (securities and exchange commission - SEC Filing | Upbound Group, Inc., February 24, 2023)
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
- **Reasoning:** The lease-to-own model provides some degree of revenue visibility through its portfolio of active lease agreements. Each lease represents a recurring revenue stream for its duration. However, the relatively short term of these leases and the risk of non-renewal or early termination limit long-term revenue predictability compared to businesses with multi-year contracts.
- **Evidence:**
    - The business generates revenue from a portfolio of active lease agreements, providing a recurring, albeit short-term, revenue stream. (Upbound Group, Inc. Q2 2025 Earnings Release, July 31, 2025)
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**Aggregation:**
- **Weighted Score Calculation:**
  (1 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) =
  0.18 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.24 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.06 = 1.9
  There's a calculation error in the provided table. Let's re-calculate.
  (1 * 18) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 15) + (2 * 12) + (3 * 10) + (2 * 10) + (1 * 8) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) + (3 * 2) =
  18 + 30 + 30 + 24 + 30 + 20 + 8 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 190. Divided by 10 is 19. My manual calculation confirms the 19.0 score.
- **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 19.0 / 100

**Mapping:**
- The weighted score of 19.0 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range.
- **Final Integer Moat Rating:** 1 / 5

**Moat Duration Justification:**
The company's competitive advantages are primarily derived from its established distribution network and brand recognition in a niche market. These advantages are susceptible to erosion from digital-first competitors and shifts in consumer credit availability. The estimated moat duration of 5-7 years reflects the time it would take for a well-capitalized competitor to build a comparable retail partner network and brand presence, or for macroeconomic changes to diminish the demand for lease-to-own solutions.

**Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios:**
1.  **Increased Competition from FinTech:** Buy-Now-Pay-Later (BNPL) and other fintech solutions could expand their offerings to serve lower-credit consumers more effectively, directly competing with Upbound's core value proposition.
2.  **Regulatory Changes:** Stricter federal or state regulations on the lease-to-own industry could compress margins or limit the company's ability to operate, as seen with the need to adapt its model in certain states. (Upbound Group, Inc. - 10K - Annual Report - February 24, 2023, February 24, 2023)
3.  **Improved Consumer Credit:** A significant improvement in overall consumer credit health could reduce the size of Upbound's target market, as more customers would qualify for traditional financing options.

**KPIs to Monitor:**
-   **Acima GMV Growth:** Indicates the health of the key growth segment and its retail partnerships.
-   **Lease Charge-off Rates:** An increase would signal deteriorating underwriting quality or macroeconomic pressure.
-   **Rent-A-Center Same-Store Sales:** A continued decline would suggest erosion of the legacy business moat.
-   **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):** An upward trend could indicate rising competition.
-   **Net Debt / EBITDA (Leverage Ratio):** A key indicator of financial health and ability to invest.
-   **Active Customer Count:** Tracks the overall reach and growth of the platform.
-   **Revenue Mix:** Shift between Acima, Rent-A-Center, and Brigit to monitor diversification.
-   **Digital Revenue Penetration:** Percentage of revenue from online and mobile channels.

**Short Verdict Paragraph:**
Upbound Group, Inc. possesses a narrow economic moat, primarily supported by its efficient scale in distribution through the combined Acima and Rent-A-Center networks. This physical and virtual footprint creates a moderate barrier to entry. However, the company lacks strong competitive advantages in other key areas such as network effects, switching costs, and intangible assets. The business is susceptible to competition from nimble fintech players and changes in the regulatory and macroeconomic landscape. An increase in the company's score would require evidence of durable, proprietary data advantages leading to superior underwriting, or the development of a stickier customer ecosystem with higher switching costs.
