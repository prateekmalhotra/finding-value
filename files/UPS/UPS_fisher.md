United Parcel Service, Inc. (UPS); Analysis Date: August 23, 2025; Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Annual Report (10-K) filed February 18, 2025, and various Q1-Q2 2025 earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS's strategic focus is on markets with strong growth potential, specifically healthcare, small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), B2B, and international segments. The company is actively investing in specialized capabilities like cold-chain logistics to better serve the complex needs of healthcare and life sciences customers, a market with significant long-term demand. The continued global growth of e-commerce provides a durable tailwind for its core package delivery services, particularly for its Digital Access Program, which embeds UPS solutions into e-commerce platforms to capture more of the SMB market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear commitment to ongoing development through its "Innovation Driven" strategy, which focuses on leveraging technology to optimize its network. Tangible examples include the implementation of RFID technology in its "Smart Package Smart Facilities" to enhance efficiency and visibility. The company is also actively expanding its service portfolio through acquisitions, such as the purchases of Frigo-Trans and Biotech & Pharma Logistics in January 2025 to bolster its healthcare logistics capabilities. These actions indicate a proactive approach to developing new processes and entering higher-value markets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS does not disclose a specific figure for Research & Development, instead categorizing these expenses under broader headings like "technology and content". While this makes a direct peer comparison of R&D as a percentage of revenue impossible, the company's "Innovation Driven" strategy and specific technology investments, like the Smart Package Smart Facility RFID initiative, serve as qualitative evidence of its development efforts. However, without quantifiable output metrics (e.g., patents, successful new service revenue) or direct R&D spending figures, it is difficult to definitively assess the effectiveness of these efforts relative to the company's substantial size.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS demonstrates a strong sales effort through its ability to serve 1.6 million daily shipping customers and its focus on high-growth segments. The company's "Digital Access Program" is a key strategic initiative that effectively targets and integrates with the burgeoning small- and medium-sized business (SMB) and e-commerce markets, driving volume growth in these areas. For the twelve months ending in the second quarter of 2025, UPS held a market share of 50.04% relative to its direct publicly-traded competitors. This significant market share, combined with a clear strategy for penetrating high-value markets, indicates an above-average sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGSFXPA2BEalnhiMrGC-_B7EWASeg3KSdVLPD4VlsmJ_iu3eLz5QUgfoo9muc3HRCELVfFF4WNLbY4dE5a3vI2yXVUleKhNIgbBYKPSO4Uj8xHCqcDkyqlvI_hJU-d-vL4Ndm0afm6DgaiQJ2bwvxQyClgMzg==]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 fiscal year, UPS reported a consolidated operating margin of 9.3%. For the trailing twelve months as of March 18, 2024, UPS's operating margin of 10.6% was significantly higher than competitor FedEx's margin of 7% for the same period. Although UPS's margins have declined from previous highs due to increased labor and operational costs, they remain superior to those of its closest competitor, indicating a worthwhile profit margin within its industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQELDa4MTGrFwgi-I6GZ7uU0c6g4YUYth7FRMAb5VvAC004YtrOgL_wfbIkG8S02JbhHRwvUbWK12iP-uNpvbdb0uutSu0CrE0X2Vw1lOzT_MEsH5b6dzBODgmEsLNjg9drkIk3DfCLlm5s_emPdgClRsFnVmkwD8T2WfCxtRpx4Y0UrrViqIPgCpW28pgI00qGlgycA8Kd10OAb9xknOQ-UBG1iHqwGp-ZoZtw=]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS is actively implementing significant cost-saving and efficiency programs. During 2024, the "Fit to Serve" initiative was executed to "right-size" the business, resulting in a reduction of approximately 14,000 management positions. Looking ahead, the company has launched "Network Reconfiguration and Efficiency Reimagined" initiatives, which are expected to yield approximately $1.0 billion in annualized savings starting in 2025 by consolidating facilities and redesigning processes. These actions demonstrate a clear and aggressive strategy to improve margins by controlling costs and boosting operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS has a heavily unionized workforce, with over 75% of its U.S. employees represented by unions, primarily the Teamsters. In 2023, the company averted a major strike after contentious negotiations, ultimately reaching a five-year agreement that the Teamsters leadership hailed as "historic," providing significant wage increases for both full-time and part-time workers. While the agreement prevented a calamitous strike and set a new standard, the negotiations themselves were difficult, particularly over the issue of part-time worker pay. The high-pressure nature of the recent negotiations and the ongoing need to manage relations with a large unionized workforce prevent a classification of "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFBqSMebQaUpTiRyfWxwni66Hq0mXzzc-IAVP-xmbR1kR2a1BhFx4tj08221shWHuQyNweifOdqynzKF9FHe8MA5_gIbUYeIyL8nTQuT9WdRxgJPDcGY7O8Yf3FHAB-RgOOt_mu5IvXQsb2J6u3lUq67bp39VMVjPXtZmPJkhXmKCBXcA1unSFcd7sWo80dWPrhMv5Tb2qKrdBwbCb4pNGu2kXlTA==], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH3soFhAJwV6A4mdQ1DBgpi1wC-4dNWX4GgfN0rbgDAnnRSE_rKIVEUs1d2GEkhSoToCbq6nWi5uPkPOCAZ3HKrD0hXjE6GnEUcRvMPlFeGZeLnV5PcBqoZJTVKPcoiGhriRccnPQI9aDE0Kwpp1s38a5IJi_G7I2quk82ZKjJr0ef8xck=, https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGDob2YeP4cz2cZGDxPrv3XLD_hPJRjrvuYex7iLzupVZhH8vyZs7_B2giB2lClqyvMoaOYy0ie5c8DGgJXyzYZ-bU4izLHc6KY07PSEvrbXqoYAbR_pq1AnTHbjPpRic8jJKCs-vS2F1l-MVVR2UfoDtY_Y44u1tACxAj57Tpe]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current CEO, Carol Tomé, was appointed in June 2020. The average tenure of the management team is approximately 5 years, which is considered experienced. The board of directors has an average tenure of 6.3 years. Historically, UPS has a reputation for stable and predictable leadership transitions, with a pattern of promoting from within. There is no public evidence of significant friction or instability among the senior executive team or with the board of directors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHBTFFQWiVQBaSWqem3nsJVP0XKg2x371BLSlYvLAFeV1tYss-VR9I2RK4OG7wjvLl2CygfxYnG0ikhVvXb5_fSLPH11fIl_RgiNHx-Jxy0QK7mOxPj63rpfVlHTYnyUC_BIlI0OHPy5LQ3zCifiOkFo8XYqAW4VYTLdthwqWh2KSQmhI_LgUIH6-PHwrrqsEVlcoIPFA3zqOMP]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS's executive leadership team is well-defined, with seasoned executives heading key operational segments and functions. Leaders are in place for U.S. operations, International/Healthcare/Supply Chain, and key functional areas like Finance, HR, Legal, and Technology. For example, Kate Gutmann leads the combined International, Healthcare and Supply Chain Solutions segments, while Nando Cesarone heads the large U.S. segment. This structure, combined with the company's long-standing practice of internal promotion, suggests a strong bench of experienced leaders and mitigates key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHvK6-bpYxzCR2figKOEUNPqyGX0btybLRsT-EjuLD0AWH-Lr7JsXAxXpfXFs2fy2E_kr4qwrRVfvpW2H72JWj1KFMDu6dOQ4FdK8BvHlKOJcg_CEEyuvt3STBD2TG4l-vYawhRj9N2LzNlVgecUmGs5Z8=]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS provides detailed financial reporting broken down into three segments: U.S. Domestic Package, International Package, and Supply Chain Solutions, allowing for clear analysis of each unit's performance. The 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, on both the financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. However, the company settled with the SEC in November 2024 regarding its improper valuation of the UPS Freight unit in 2019 and 2020, pointing to a past failure in accounting controls and judgment. While the auditor's report is clean for the most recent period, the recent SEC settlement prevents an answer of "Yes."
**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS's key competitive advantage is its single, integrated global air and ground network, which provides significant operational and capital efficiencies compared to competitors with separate networks. This "Global Smart Logistics Network" allows the company to handle all package types (air, ground, domestic, international) in one system, optimizing asset utilization and enhancing customer visibility through technologies like RFID. Furthermore, the company's deep investment in specialized, high-margin services like healthcare and cold-chain logistics provides another layer of competitive differentiation against more generalized carriers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a willingness to prioritize long-term profitability over short-term revenue. In the first quarter of 2025, UPS reached an agreement with its largest customer to significantly reduce their volume, a deliberate shift to "increase our focus on growing higher yielding volume." This move, while impacting near-term revenue, is aimed at improving long-term margin quality. This strategic decision, coupled with multi-year investments in network optimization ("Network Reconfiguration") and technology, clearly indicates a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS's financial position is strong, obviating the need for dilutive equity financing. The company generated $10.1 billion in cash from operations in 2024 and is actively returning capital to shareholders. In 2024, UPS paid $5.4 billion in dividends and repurchased $500 million of its shares. As of year-end 2024, $2.3 billion remained available under its share repurchase authorization, and the company announced a further $1.0 billion accelerated share repurchase in February 2025. This consistent return of capital, backed by strong cash flow, indicates a very low risk of equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial reporting and management commentary appear candid. The 2024 10-K openly discusses significant challenges, including the rationale and expected impacts of reducing volume from its largest customer, the costs associated with the new Teamsters contract, and details on its workforce reduction and network reconfiguration plans. Recent earnings call transcripts also show management addressing difficult questions from analysts regarding macroeconomic headwinds and competitive pressures. This transparency in discussing both strategic pivots and operational challenges suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm (February 18, 2025)], [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/UPS/transcripts/ (Accessed August 23, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are recent events that question the company's integrity. In November 2024, UPS agreed to pay a $45 million penalty to settle SEC charges that it materially misrepresented its earnings by improperly valuing its UPS Freight business unit in 2019 and 2020. The SEC found that UPS ignored its own internal analysis and provided an outside consultant with incomplete information to avoid a goodwill impairment charge. This action, designed to inflate earnings, points to a significant lapse in integrity at the management level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEFzKHvdqr4NAe9Zp6SA6VtI9QGqcLHXmDFURUp1Y8tXnd0kByRHr6cvezhUxrCEoBvDqKocNDDYSzo3N39R8GRQDPtbKUuvepjg0RR3LOzZ25cntY8ZfSVWar61w_t6P_9CStY6cuOWLafPZIeRxYpAI1eJEq-YSzqSbAQg99eMlvRpfkX], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGZIPuv98lmEcGz-qieRlXkY8EdPv0IKghQW3Dk-YO5CcXMuxxKNr-27Hi8LkKNiAU4qcfvsj9TgcaXg9FRQVPZmecB5SECVuMnpgokDLmHiGBmHNe2jTJVwCc_kUsIlwEi-0sNd3JZJ-UJx79PMVbhfA==], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEN_Qdxun5AebCeKTPUFEr-JdOB98WsoQcoOQ7nK3SesBKBZr0Zxc3q6iNoFrQr6SUu664-nXVInlO0actRf5bUud8zGPB2vsrW0YlEbJ9IF1h-yueO0ijrKwomXXcw0FLr1scpT2eBgS9oNVjlShvuQKD7pLe89WGU_5wjrvMnDlE5apKMKu23h-RMY2TRfE38oCqiXarZ1keMT46-61DmzkGIRb0BImjuWrBqCdXeHP0goPK5DFk3Aqd6FEpn5PE0]

---
**Synthesis:**
UPS scores well on its forward-looking strategy, demonstrating a clear focus on high-growth markets like healthcare and SMBs, and a willingness to make tough short-term decisions—such as reducing low-margin volume—to secure long-term profitability. The company's financial strength is robust, allowing for significant investments in network efficiency and consistent capital returns to shareholders without risk of dilution. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses in labor relations and integrity. The contentious 2023 Teamsters negotiation and the 2024 SEC settlement for improper accounting practices are material negatives. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12–24 months are the execution of its "Network Reconfiguration," which must deliver its promised $1.0 billion in savings, and the outcome of the pilot union agreement negotiations in 2025. A smooth labor negotiation and tangible margin improvements from its efficiency programs would be needed to flip the "No" on labor relations, while sustained, incident-free financial reporting would be required to begin rebuilding confidence in the company's integrity.
