### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

No explicit, forward-looking quantitative guidance on revenue, margins, or capex was provided in the most recent earnings call or SEC filings. Management commentary focuses on long-term strategy, operational efficiency, and international expansion.

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Assumption:** A 12.0% annual growth rate for the next five years is assumed.
    *   **Rationale:** This is a conservative estimate based on the company's 3-year historical revenue CAGR of 14.5%, adjusted for the law of large numbers. The growth is supported by management's discussion of international expansion and investments in logistics and technology.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Assumption:** Operating margin is projected to remain stable at the TTM level of 39.8%.
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of specific management guidance on margin expansion, the TTM margin is used as a baseline.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Assumption:** An effective tax rate of 22.0% is used.
    *   **Rationale:** This is based on the average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed to be 10.0% of revenue, in line with the 3-year historical average, reflecting ongoing investments in land and technology.
    *   **Working Capital:** Projected as 1.5% of incremental revenue, based on the historical relationship.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** Projected to grow in line with revenue.
    *   **Diluted Shares:** The most recent diluted weighted-average share count of 973.9 million is used for the final valuation.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD in Millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |

| Revenue | $4,940.6 | $5,533.5 | $6,197.5 | $6,941.2 | $7,774.2 |
| EBIT | $1,966.4 | $2,202.4 | $2,466.7 | $2,762.7 | $3,094.2 |
| NOPAT | $1,533.8 | $1,717.8 | $1,924.0 | $2,154.9 | $2,413.5 |

| Change in NWC | ($7.9) | ($8.9) | ($9.9) | ($11.1) | ($12.5) |
| **FCFF** | **$1,177.6** | **$1,319.0** | **$1,477.1** | **$1,654.5** | **$1,853.0** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (based on the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield as of August 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0%
    *   **Beta:** 1.10 (Sourced from Yahoo Finance, 5-year monthly). This beta is considered reasonable as it reflects the company's cyclical exposure to the auto and insurance industries.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.10 * 5.0% = 9.75%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-tax Cost of Debt:** 4.5% (estimated based on credit profile and interest rates).
    *   **After-tax Cost of Debt = 4.5% * (1 - 22.0%) = 3.51%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity:** $45.2 Billion
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $584.5 Million
    *   **WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1-t) = (45.2/45.8) * 9.75% + (0.6/45.8) * 3.51% = 9.68%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a reasonable long-term growth rate, in line with expected long-run inflation.
    *   **Terminal Value = FCFF(Y5) * (1+g) / (WACC - g) = $1,853.0 * (1.025) / (9.68% - 2.5%) = $26,432.2 Million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   A 15.0x EV/EBITDA multiple is applied to the Year 5 EBITDA of $3,417.6M, resulting in a terminal value of approximately $51,264M. The Gordon Growth method produces a more conservative valuation and will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** $5,925.4 Million
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $16,666.8 Million
*   **Enterprise Value = $5,925.4 + $16,666.8 = $22,592.2 Million**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = $584.5M (Total Debt) - $3,456.3M (Cash) = -$2,871.8M
    *   **Equity Value = $22,592.2M - (-$2,871.8M) = $25,464.0 Million**

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $25,464.0M / 973.9M = $26.15 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $26.15**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $20.00:** Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 9%) and margin compression due to increased competition or a downturn in the auto market.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $33.00:** Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 14%) and modest margin expansion driven by international growth and technology leverage.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value.
    *   **MOS Price = $26.15 * (1 - 0.30) = $18.30**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** The business is sensitive to the frequency of car accidents, which can be impacted by economic activity and driving patterns.
2.  **Competition:** While Copart is a market leader, increased competition could pressure service fees and margins.
3.  **Regulatory Risks:** Changes in environmental regulations or titling laws could impact the salvage vehicle market.
4.  **Catastrophic Event Dependency:** A portion of revenue is driven by major weather events (e.g., hurricanes), which are unpredictable.

final answer is 26.15 $
