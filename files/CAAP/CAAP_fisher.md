Corporación América Airports S.A., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed include Q2 2025 earnings release and transcript snippets.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Corporación América Airports S.A. (CAAP) operates 52 airports in 6 countries, a business with a long runway tied to global and regional economic growth, tourism, and trade. The company's recent performance shows a positive trajectory, with a reported 13.7% year-over-year increase in passenger traffic in the second quarter of 2025, reaching nearly 21 million passengers. This growth is broad-based, with notable increases in Argentina and Brazil. The inherent demand for air travel, coupled with the company's diversified portfolio of airports, suggests a strong potential for sustained sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Snippets from the Q2 2025 earnings call indicate a focus on growth, with the CEO mentioning "moving on our growth plans." The company is also actively managing its portfolio, as evidenced by the termination of the Natal airport concession. However, without access to the full annual report or investor presentations, it is difficult to ascertain specific details about new development projects or a formal commitment to ongoing development beyond core operations.
**Answer:** No

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an airport operator, traditional R&D metrics like patents or product launches are not directly applicable. Effectiveness would be measured by innovation in airport management, technology adoption for efficiency, and commercial offerings. The available information from search snippets does not provide any details on the company's R&D or innovation-related expenditures or initiatives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CAAP's "sales" are driven by passenger and cargo traffic, as well as commercial revenues from concessions. The 18.5% year-on-year increase in international traffic in Argentina and the growth in commercial revenues from VIP lounges and duty-free in Uruguay suggest an effective commercial strategy. The company also reported a revenue per passenger of $21, indicating successful monetization of its passenger traffic.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFSzd3MqTJO2H_i9NLw1XHy_tQSnDh9yvAHosplvu8Sx8uDxh_L_THY-FcquyMUJq4Qa_0M1n3VIbDMlRDdWCIu14Tph6CNivAMLpgRNHnfKW-exwEYt4i--5vx_8WR4PC6AhEMumpIvcUxmrUTNIo2WkwUfJ9w9FXyy-FmSmQ9UbfToIXtID3aB_q4I_HfSfmnS6zK8bR8l0LPWWVcekQt9ALdoBYPOoOVRQ==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFSzd3MqTJO2H_i9NLw1XHy_tQSnDh9yvAHosplvu8Sx8uDxh_L_THY-FcquyMUJq4Qa_0M1n3VIbDMlRDdWCIu14Tph6CNivAMLpgRNHnfKW-exwEYt4i--5vx_8WR4PC6AhEMumpIvcUxmrUTNIo2WkwUfJ9w9FXyy-FmSmQ9UbfToIXtID3aB_q4I_HfSfmnS6zK8bR8l0LPWWVcekQt9ALdoBYPOoOVRQ==) (August 21, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the second quarter of 2025, Corporación América Airports reported an Adjusted EBITDA margin ex-IFRIC12 of 38.6%, an expansion of 1.4 percentage points from 37.2% in the same quarter of the previous year. This indicates a strong and improving profit margin. The adjusted EBITDA itself increased by 23.3% to $167.9 million.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is improving margins through a combination of revenue growth and disciplined execution. Revenue growth is outpacing passenger growth, driven by tariff adjustments, such as the one implemented in Argentina in November 2024, and strong commercial performance, particularly in cargo and other passenger-related revenues like duty-free and VIP lounges. The CEO's comment on "disciplined execution" also points to a focus on cost management.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The search result snippets from the earnings release and transcript do not contain any information regarding the company's labor and personnel relations, such as employee turnover, union relations, or employee satisfaction metrics.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The earnings call transcript shows a standard presentation by the CEO, CFO, and Head of Investor Relations, suggesting a functional executive team. However, the available information does not provide any specific details about board stability, succession planning, or incentive alignment that would be necessary to assess the quality of executive relations.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Q2 2025 earnings call was led by the CEO, Martín Eurnekian, and the CFO, Jorge Arruda, with the Head of Investor Relations, Patricio Iñaki Esnaola, also present. While this indicates a competent leadership team for investor communications, the snippets do not provide information on the broader management team or succession planning.
**Answer:** No

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company reports its financial results in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and provides segment-level data in its earnings reports, as evidenced by the discussion of performance in Argentina, Uruguay, and Armenia. This suggests a degree of sophistication in its accounting and cost analysis. However, without access to the full 20-F filing, a thorough assessment of the company's accounting controls is not possible.
**Answer:** No

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the airport concession industry, key competitive advantages include the strategic location of airports, the length and terms of concession agreements, and the ability to grow non-aeronautical revenues. CAAP operates some of the largest airports in its countries of operation and has a diversified portfolio across Latin America and Europe. The company's ability to increase revenue per passenger to $21 demonstrates its effectiveness in generating non-aeronautical revenues.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The CEO's statement about having the "flexibility to keep moving on our growth plans" suggests a long-range outlook. However, without access to the full earnings call transcript or investor day presentations, it is difficult to determine the extent to which the company prioritizes long-term growth over short-term profitability.
**Answer:** No

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Corporación América Airports had a strong liquidity position with cash and cash equivalents of $496.8 million. The company's Argentine subsidiary, AA2000, recently approved a $150 million dividend distribution, which further indicates financial strength. This strong cash position suggests that the company is well-positioned to fund its growth plans without needing to resort to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed presentations for investors. The earnings call transcript includes a safe harbor statement regarding forward-looking statements, which is standard practice. However, without examples of how the company has communicated during times of trouble, it is not possible to fully assess its candor.
**Answer:** No

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The available search snippets do not provide any information regarding legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would call into question the integrity of the company's management. However, a lack of negative evidence is not conclusive proof of unquestionable integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**Synthesis**

Corporación América Airports S.A. demonstrates strength in its core business, with growing passenger traffic and improving profit margins. The company's diversified portfolio of airports and strong liquidity position are significant positives. The biggest unknowns in this analysis, and the factors most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months, are related to management's long-term strategy, depth, and personnel relations. A clearer articulation of the company's growth plans beyond the current recovery, evidence of a strong management team beyond the CEO and CFO, and positive disclosures about employee relations would be needed to turn many of the "No" answers to "Yes". Access to the full 20-F annual report and investor day presentations would be critical to making a more informed assessment.
