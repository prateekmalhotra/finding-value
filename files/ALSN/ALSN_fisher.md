### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission is actively pursuing growth through multiple avenues. The company projects significant organic growth from its international business, where the adoption of fully automatic transmissions is lower than in North America. Additionally, Allison is expanding its product portfolio to include electric hybrid and fully electric propulsion systems, such as the eGen Power and eGen Flex, to meet the growing demand for electric vehicles in the commercial sector. Management has identified $400 million in incremental annual revenue opportunities from new developments in mining dump trucks, fracking transmissions, and defense applications.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission demonstrates a strong commitment to ongoing development through consistent investment in research and development. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company's R&D expenses were $200 million, an increase from $194 million in 2023, primarily driven by increased spending on product initiatives. The company is focused on developing new products and technologies to improve fuel efficiency and expand its portfolio of electric hybrid and fully electric propulsion solutions. This is further evidenced by the reclassification of $23 million of in-process research and development (IPR&D) to Proprietary Technology upon the completion of the eGen Power products project.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Allison's R&D spending of $200 million represented approximately 6.2% of its $3.225 billion in net sales. This investment has led to the successful development and launch of new product lines, including the eGen series of electric and hybrid propulsion systems and the FracTran for the energy sector. The commercialization of the eGen Power products, marked by the reclassification of IPR&D to proprietary technology, indicates a tangible output from R&D investments. These new product lines are expected to contribute significantly to future revenue, suggesting that the company's R&D efforts are effective in creating new growth opportunities.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission has a robust global sales and service network consisting of approximately 1,600 independent distributor and dealer locations worldwide. This extensive network is a key competitive advantage, providing a strong foundation for both new product sales and a stable aftermarket revenue stream. The company's sales and marketing efforts are organized by geographic region and customer, including dedicated teams for OEM sales and national accounts. This structure allows Allison to build deep relationships with key customers and effectively create demand for its products with end-users.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission consistently demonstrates strong profitability. For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross profit margin of 47.4% and an operating profit margin of 30.8%. For the nine months ended September 30, 2024, the company's gross profit margin was 47.6% and its Adjusted EBITDA margin was 36.8%. These margins are indicative of a strong competitive position and efficient operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm), [10-Q - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017024118639/alsn-20240930.htm)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission actively manages its margins through a combination of pricing actions and cost control. The company has successfully implemented price increases on certain products, which contributed to an $80 million increase in gross profit in 2024. Additionally, many of the company's long-term agreements with OEMs include provisions for sharing commodity cost risk, which helps to mitigate the impact of raw material price volatility. While increased labor costs from the new UAW agreement present a headwind, the company's pricing power and cost-sharing arrangements are key strategies for maintaining strong margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In January 2024, the UAW Local 933 ratified a new four-year collective bargaining agreement, which suggests a functional, albeit potentially costly, relationship with its unionized workforce. The company notes that it expects to experience a significant increase in labor costs under the new agreement. While the successful negotiation of a long-term agreement is a positive sign, the associated cost increases and the potential for future labor disputes prevent a definitive "Yes" without more information on employee satisfaction and turnover.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no readily available public information to suggest any issues with executive relations at Allison Transmission. The company's leadership team appears stable, and there are no reports of significant executive turnover or internal disputes. However, without specific disclosures on succession planning or other internal executive matters, it is difficult to definitively assess the quality of these relationships.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission's leadership team, as detailed in its investor relations materials, shows a range of experienced executives across various functions. However, the company's public filings do not provide detailed information about management depth beyond the named executive officers or specific succession plans. This lack of readily available information makes it difficult to fully assess the depth of the management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The report from the independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, states that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting. There are no mentions of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the "Controls and Procedures" section of the 10-K. The company's financial statements are audited annually, and the consistent reporting and absence of restatements suggest that the accounting controls are robust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission's key competitive advantages in the commercial vehicle industry are its strong brand reputation, deep relationships with OEMs, and an extensive global service and distribution network. The company's products are known for their quality, reliability, and durability, which creates strong "pull-through" demand from end-users who specify Allison transmissions when ordering new vehicles. This brand loyalty, combined with the high costs of switching for OEMs, creates a significant barrier to entry for competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison's consistent and increasing investment in R&D, particularly in the development of electric and hybrid propulsion systems, indicates a long-range outlook. The company is investing heavily in new technologies that may take several years to generate significant returns, demonstrating a willingness to prioritize long-term growth over short-term profits. Management's focus on expanding into international markets, where the adoption of automatic transmissions is still in its early stages, further supports this conclusion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Allison Transmission generates strong and consistent cash flow from operations, with $801 million generated in fiscal year 2024. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through a significant stock repurchase program, with $254 million of stock repurchased in 2024 and $519 million remaining under the current authorization as of December 31, 2024. This strong cash generation and commitment to share buybacks, rather than share issuances, indicates a very low risk of equity dilution to fund future growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of Allison's earnings call transcripts shows that management provides detailed explanations of their financial results and business trends. They address both positive and negative developments, such as the decline in the Global Off-Highway market in 2024, and provide clear explanations for these trends. The company also provides detailed financial guidance and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures, which suggests a commitment to transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm), [10-Q - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017024118639/alsn-20240930.htm)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal proceedings or regulatory actions mentioned in the company's recent SEC filings that would call into question the integrity of the management team. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 10-K notes that the company is subject to various claims arising in the ordinary course of business but does not believe the outcome of these will have a material adverse effect. Without any evidence to the contrary, management appears to have unquestionable integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [10-K - SEC.gov](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411207/000095017025019379/alsn-20241231.htm)

**Synthesis:**

Allison Transmission Holdings scores well on the majority of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a strong, well-managed company with a dominant market position. The company's primary strengths lie in its long product runway, commitment to R&D, robust sales organization, high-profit margins, strong financial controls, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to manage the increased labor costs from the new UAW agreement and the market adoption rate of its new electric and hybrid propulsion systems. To change the "No" answers to "Yes", the company would need to provide more public disclosure on its management depth and succession planning, as well as demonstrate a period of stability and positive employee feedback following the new UAW agreement.

**Fisher Score is 12 / 15**
