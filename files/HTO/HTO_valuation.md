### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

The forecast is built on management commentary and historical performance.

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5): 6.5%**
    *   **Rationale:** This uses the midpoint of the "top half" of management's long-term 5-7% earnings growth guidance, which is a reasonable proxy for revenue growth in a stable utility business.
*   **Operating Margin: 24.1%**
    *   **Rationale:** In the absence of specific margin guidance, the TTM operating margin of 24.1% is held constant. This is a conservative assumption reflecting the regulated nature of the utility business.
*   **Tax Rate: 10.0%**
    *   **Rationale:** This uses the TTM effective tax rate of 9.79%, rounded for simplicity, as calculated from the income statement (11.16M Tax / 113.95M Pretax Income).
*   **Capital Expenditures: 55% of Revenue**
    *   **Rationale:** Management's 2025 capex guidance is $473M, which is an unusually high 60% of 2025's projected revenue. The historical 3-year average is closer to 50%. A blended rate of 55% is used to smooth out the large guided investment in year one.
*   **Change in Working Capital: -5.4% of Revenue**
    *   **Rationale:** This is based on the TTM Change in WC as a percentage of TTM Revenue (-$42.33M / $788.74M), held constant.
*   **Stock-Based Comp.: 0.7% of Revenue**
    *   **Rationale:** Based on the TTM SBC as a percentage of TTM Revenue ($5.48M / $788.74M), held constant.

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers. The formula is:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (In Millions USD) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $840.01 | $894.61 | $952.76 | $1,014.69 | $1,080.65 |
| **EBIT** | **$202.44** | **$215.60** | **$229.61** | **$244.54** | **$260.43** |
| Taxes (10.0%) | ($20.24) | ($21.56) | ($22.96) | ($24.45) | ($26.04) |
| **NOPAT** | **$182.20** | **$194.04** | **$206.65** | **$220.09** | **$234.39** |
| D&A | $120.48 | $128.34 | $136.69 | $145.58 | $155.15 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($5.88) | ($6.26) | ($6.67) | ($7.10) | ($7.56) |
| Capex | ($462.01) | ($492.04) | ($524.02) | ($558.08) | ($594.36) |
| Change in WC | $45.36 | $48.31 | $51.45 | $54.79 | $58.35 |
| **FCFF** | **($119.85)** | **($127.61)** | **($135.89)** | **($144.72)** | **($153.99)** |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM): 8.36%**
    *   **Formula:** Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 20, 2025).
    *   **Beta:** 0.53. This low beta reflects the non-cyclical, regulated nature of a water utility.
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5%. A standard assumption for the U.S. market.
    *   **Calculation:** 4.29% + 0.53 * 5.5% = 8.36%
*   **Cost of Debt: 3.84%**
    *   **Formula:** Interest Expense / Total Debt
    *   **Calculation:** $71.91M / $1,872.00M = 3.84%
*   **WACC: 4.88%**
    *   **Formula:** (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   **Market Cap (E):** $1,704.42M (34M shares * $50.13 price)
    *   **Debt (D):** $1,872.00M
    *   **Calculation:** (1704/(1704+1872)) * 8.36% + (1872/(1704+1872)) * 3.84% * (1 - 0.10) = 4.88%

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

*   **Gordon Growth Model (GGM):**
    *   **Formula:** (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This reflects long-term inflation expectations and is a sustainable rate for a mature utility.
    *   **Calculation:** (-$153.99 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0488 - 0.025) = **-$6,632.74M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Note:** The negative FCFF forecast, driven by high guided capital expenditures, makes a traditional terminal value calculation produce a negative result. This indicates the model assumptions (especially constant high capex as a % of revenue) may not be sustainable in the terminal period. A utility's value is often in its regulated asset base, which grows via capex. In this case, we will proceed, but this is a significant caveat.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

*   **Present Value of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   Calculation: PV of Years 1-5 FCFF discounted at 4.88% = **-$598.65M**
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:**
    *   Calculation: PV of GGM Terminal Value = **-$5,214.54M**
*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **Formula:** PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value
    *   **Calculation:** -$598.65M + (-$5,214.54M) = **-$5,813.19M**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   **Net Debt:** $1,872.00M (Total Debt) - $19.85M (Cash) = $1,852.15M
    *   **Calculation:** -$5,813.19M - $1,852.15M = **-$7,665.34M**

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

The DCF analysis yields a negative equity value. This is a direct result of the high, ongoing capital expenditures relative to operating cash flow within the forecast horizon. This suggests that under the current assumptions, the company is not generating positive cash flow for its providers of capital. An intrinsic valuation based purely on FCFF is therefore not meaningful. This often happens with utilities that are in a heavy investment cycle, where value is being created in the rate base but is not yet reflected in cash flows.

Given the limitations of the FCFF model in this specific case, a different valuation approach is required for a meaningful result. However, adhering strictly to the requested FCFF framework, the valuation is negative.

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** **Not Meaningful (Negative)**
*   **Low/Bear Case:** Not Meaningful
*   **High/Bull Case:** Not Meaningful
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** Not Applicable

### Risk Notes

1.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company's ability to earn a fair return on its significant capital investments depends on favorable outcomes in general rate cases. Any adverse regulatory decisions could impair profitability.
2.  **Execution Risk:** The large $473 million capex plan for 2025 carries execution risk. Delays or cost overruns could negatively impact the expected returns on these investments.
3.  **Interest Rate Risk:** As a capital-intensive utility, the company's profitability is sensitive to changes in interest rates, which affect its cost of debt for funding infrastructure projects.
4.  **Valuation Model Sensitivity:** The DCF valuation is highly sensitive to the assumption of high, sustained capital expenditures. The model's negative outcome highlights that if these investments do not generate sufficient future cash flow, they will destroy rather than create value.
