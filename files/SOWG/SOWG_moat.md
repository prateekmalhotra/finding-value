### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Sow Good operates as a consumer-packaged goods (CPG) manufacturer. Its business model does not benefit from network effects, as the value of its product does not increase for a user as more people use it. Customer acquisition is based on traditional retail and distribution channels, not a user-based network.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business is described as a "U.S.-based freeze dried candy and snack manufacturer" that sells through wholesale, retail, and e-commerce channels. (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** There are virtually no switching costs for Sow Good's customers, who are primarily retailers and distributors. A catastrophic 78% decline in quarterly revenue demonstrates that customers can and will switch to competitors with ease, likely due to better terms, pricing, or the competitor's stronger brand pull. The company has no long-term contracts to lock in customers.
**Evidence:**
*   Revenues decreased by 78% from USD 11.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2024, to USD 2.5 million for the same period in 2025, "driven by significantly reduced demand due in large part to increased competitive and market pressure by large competitors." (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
*   "Most of our customers are retailers or distributors that buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products." (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** The company claims to use "proprietary technology" in its custom-built freeze driers, which could theoretically offer a marginal unit cost advantage over smaller entrants. However, this advantage is not durable or scalable enough to compete with large CPG players who can leverage immense scale and capital. The gross margin improved to 45% in Q1 2025 from 41% in Q1 2024, but this is likely due to changes in product mix or inventory accounting rather than a sustainable cost advantage, especially given the collapse in revenue.
**Evidence:**
*   Sow Good has "built six bespoke freeze driers using proprietary technology tailored specifically to our products." (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
*   Gross profit margin increased to 45% for the three months ended March 31, 2025, from 41% in the prior year period, attributed to "lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales." (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** Sow Good's intangible assets are weak. The company holds trademarks but no patents on its process. Its brand equity is demonstrably low, as customers have fled in the face of competition, indicating the brand commands no significant loyalty or pricing power. The "proprietary" manufacturing process is held as a trade secret, which offers minimal protection against reverse engineering or independent development by well-capitalized competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   The company relies on "unpatented proprietary expertise, recipes, and formulations, as well as other trade secrets" and its registered trademark "Sow Good." No patents are mentioned. (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
*   The sharp decline in revenue attributed to "increased competitive and market pressure" suggests the brand lacks the strength to retain customers and shelf space. (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** The company has no durable distribution advantage. While it has achieved placement in approximately 3,000 retail outlets, this position is fragile. Management explicitly states that competitors are using their market power to reduce Sow Good's shelf space, which directly caused the loss of significant customers and revenue. This is the opposite of a moat; it is a critical vulnerability.
**Evidence:**
*   "We have become aware of certain of our competitors using their status in the market and marketing spend to limit our current and future customers from purchasing our products or reducing our shelf space. This caused the loss of significant customers with resulted in a significant reduction in revenue..." (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
*   As of March 31, 2025, products are offered in approximately 3,000 retail outlets. (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** There is no evidence in the company's filings to suggest that it collects or utilizes any unique, hard-to-replicate datasets that create a competitive advantage. Its operations are typical of a traditional CPG manufacturer, not a data-driven enterprise.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's filings do not describe any data collection or analysis processes that provide a competitive advantage. The business model is based on manufacturing and selling physical goods. (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Sow Good's business model is a linear one of producing and selling goods. It does not operate a platform or ecosystem that would benefit from third-party integrations or complementary products in a way that creates lock-in or a competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as a "freeze dried candy and snack manufacturer" with an "omnichannel distribution strategy" focused on retailers, e-commerce, and distributors. This does not align with a platform or ecosystem model. (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The company is subject to standard food industry regulations by the FDA and other bodies. These regulations apply to all participants in the market and do not create special barriers to entry that protect Sow Good from competition. There are no unique licenses or patents mentioned that would impede competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   The company is subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, FTC, and other authorities, including requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), which governs manufacturing, labeling, and safety. These are standard for the industry. (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The company has invested over USD 10.0 million in a specialized manufacturing facility, creating a modest capital barrier for small start-ups. However, this level of investment is trivial for the large, established CPG competitors that are now entering the market and pressuring Sow Good. The asset specificity of the freeze-driers provides a minor advantage but is easily replicable by larger firms.
**Evidence:**
*   "Sow Good spent over two years and over $10.0 million dollars to develop a state of the art manufacturing facility and freeze drying equipment..." (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
*   The company's property and equipment, net of depreciation, was valued at USD 11.8 million as of December 31, 2024. (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** The company has no long-term customer contracts and operates on a purchase-order basis. This provides extremely low revenue visibility and predictability. The dramatic 78% quarter-over-quarter revenue drop serves as definitive evidence of the lack of revenue visibility and customer commitment.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's Risk Factors state: "Most of our customers are retailers or distributors that buy from us under purchase orders, and we generally do not have long-term agreements with or commitments from these customers for the purchase of products." (Sow Good Inc. 10-K, March 27, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (18% * 0) + (15% * 0) + (15% * 1) + (12% * 1) + (10% * 0) + (10% * 0) + (8% * 0) + (6% * 0) + (4% * 1) + (2% * 0) = 0 + 0 + 1.5 + 1.2 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.4 + 0 = 3.1
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 3.1 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   A weighted score of 3.1 is less than 10.
*   Per the thresholds, a weighted score < 10 maps to a final moat rating of 0.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is 0 years. The company currently possesses no sustainable competitive advantage. Evidence from its own financial reporting shows that its market position is actively and rapidly eroding due to pressure from larger competitors, proving that any perceived advantages in technology or branding were not durable. The "going concern" warning underscores its precarious financial state, which prevents any long-term strategic investments that could build a future moat. (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Continued Shelf-Space Erosion:** Large CPG competitors continue to use their leverage with distributors and retailers to replace Sow Good's products, leading to further revenue decline and eventual delisting from key accounts. (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
2.  **Price Competition:** Competitors with superior scale initiate a price war, compressing margins to unsustainable levels for Sow Good and forcing it to either lose money on sales or abandon the market. (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)
3.  **Inability to Secure Capital:** The "going concern" risk materializes, and the company is unable to raise the necessary capital to fund its operations, leading to insolvency. (Sow Good Inc. 10-Q, May 14, 2025)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
1.  **Quarterly Revenue Growth/Decline:** A return to growth would be the first sign of stabilization; continued decline indicates further erosion.
2.  **Gross Margin:** Monitor if the 45% margin is sustainable or if it degrades under competitive pressure.
3.  **Customer Concentration:** Any increase in reliance on its top 1-2 customers would elevate risk.
4.  **Retail Door Count:** Track the ~3,000 store count to see if it is growing or shrinking.
5.  **Cash Burn Rate:** Given the "going concern" warning, the rate at which the company uses its cash is critical for survival.
6.  **Inventory Levels vs. Sales:** High inventory relative to sales signals ongoing demand problems and potential future write-downs.
7.  **Sales & Marketing Expense:** An increase in this expense without a corresponding increase in revenue would indicate a deteriorating competitive position.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Sow Good Inc. exhibits no economic moat. The company operates in a trendy but highly competitive CPG category where it has proven vulnerable to larger, more powerful rivals. A catastrophic 78% quarterly revenue decline, explicit warnings about being pushed off shelves by competitors, high customer concentration, and a lack of meaningful intellectual property collectively point to a fragile market position. The official "going concern" risk noted in its financial statements indicates the company's very survival is in doubt, let alone its ability to defend a long-term competitive advantage. Any potential rating increase would require sustained evidence of a reversal in revenue trends, the signing of long-term customer contracts, and a demonstrated ability to defend its shelf space against major competitors.

moat rating is 0 / 5
