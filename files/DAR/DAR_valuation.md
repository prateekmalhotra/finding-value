*   **Leverage Target:** "The company anticipates improved margins in Q2 and remains focused on reducing its financial leverage to 2.5x." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, April 24, 2025).

### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

*   **Revenue Forecast (Years 1-5):** Given the recent revenue decline and management's focus on margin improvement and debt reduction, a conservative revenue growth forecast is appropriate. A 2% annual growth rate is assumed, reflecting a mature business environment.
*   **Margin Path:** Operating margin is projected to remain stable at the TTM level of 5.57%, as management has not provided specific targets for margin expansion.
*   **Taxes:** The average effective tax rate over the last three years is used, which is calculated to be approximately 15%.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled as a percentage of revenue, using the TTM Capex-to-revenue ratio of 4.82%.
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeled as a percentage of incremental revenue, using the TTM ratio of 0.26%.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** Treated as a real economic cost and subtracted from FCFF. The TTM value is used for forecasting.
    *   **Share Count:** The latest reported diluted weighted-average shares of 160 million are used.

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | FCFF |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | $5,816.04 | $323.95 | $481.33 |
| 2 | $5,932.36 | $330.43 | $490.81 |
| 3 | $6,051.01 | $337.04 | $500.52 |
| 4 | $6,172.03 | $343.78 | $510.46 |
| 5 | $6,295.47 | $350.66 | $520.64 |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (assumed based on current 10-year Treasury yield).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.2 (reflecting the company's cyclicality and commodity exposure).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.2 \* 5.0% = 10.25%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Average Debt = $231.6M / $4,217M = 5.49%
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Cap = $30.80 \* 160M shares = $4,928M
    *   Enterprise Value = Market Cap + Net Debt = $4,928M + ($4,217M - $94.58M) = $9,050.42M
    *   **WACC = (E/V) \* Re + (D/V) \* Rd \* (1-t) = (4928/9050.42) \* 10.25% + (4122.42/9050.42) \* 5.49% \* (1-0.15) = 7.7%**

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Gordon Growth Model:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (in line with long-run inflation expectations).
    *   **Terminal Value = FCFF(5) \* (1+g) / (WACC - g) = $520.64M \* (1.025) / (0.077 - 0.025) = $10,248.8M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   A conservative 8x EV/EBITDA multiple is assumed, in line with historical averages for the sector.
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $350.66M + $496.61M = $847.27M**
    *   **Terminal Value = 8 \* $847.27M = $6,778.16M**
    *   The lower of the two terminal values is used in the final valuation.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **Enterprise Value = PV of explicit period FCFF + PV of Terminal Value = $1,895.34M + $4,683.47M = $6,578.81M**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt = $6,578.81M - ($4,217M - $94.58M) = $2,456.39M**

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares = $2,456.39M / 160M = $15.35**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** Lower growth (0%), margin compression (4.5% EBIT margin) -> **$10.50**
    *   **High/Bull Case:** Higher growth (4%), margin expansion (6.5% EBIT margin) -> **$22.75**
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value results in a MOS price of **$10.75**.

### Risk Notes

1.  **Commodity Price Volatility:** Darling's profitability is highly sensitive to fluctuations in the prices of its key finished products (fats, proteins, used cooking oil) and the cost of raw materials.
2.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company's renewable diesel joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel, is dependent on government mandates and tax credits, which are subject to change.
3.  **Competition for Raw Materials:** The procurement of animal by-products and used cooking oil is highly competitive, and any disruption in supply could adversely affect operations.
4.  **Integration Risk:** The company has made several large acquisitions in recent years, and any failure to successfully integrate these businesses could negatively impact financial results.
5.  **Foreign Currency Exposure:** Darling has significant international operations and is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

final answer is 15.35 $
