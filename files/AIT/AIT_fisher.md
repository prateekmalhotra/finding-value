**Synthesis**

Applied Industrial Technologies scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its strongest positives being its strong market position, commitment to growth, and excellent financial performance. The company has a clear strategy for growth and is executing well on its initiatives. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to continue to successfully integrate acquisitions and its ability to navigate the challenges of a mixed end-market environment. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness if the company were to begin disclosing more specific metrics on the success of its engineered solutions and a "No" for labor relations could be flipped with the publication of employee satisfaction data.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
