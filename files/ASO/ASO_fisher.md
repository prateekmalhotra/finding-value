Synthesis: Academy Sports and Outdoors scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, profitability, and financial strength. The company's strong balance sheet and commitment to returning cash to shareholders are also positives. The main area of concern is the recent decline in comparable sales, which raises questions about the effectiveness of its current sales and marketing strategies. The score could be improved if the company can demonstrate a return to positive comparable sales growth. A "No" on the above-average sales organization could flip to a "Yes" with sustained positive comparable sales growth and market share gains.
fisher score is 14 / 15
