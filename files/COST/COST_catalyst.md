### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Membership Fee Increase

*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On September 1, 2024, Costco raised its annual membership fees in the U.S. and Canada. The Gold Star and Business memberships increased to $65, and the Executive membership fee rose to $130.
*   **Mechanism:** The fee increase will directly boost high-margin revenue, which is expected to flow through to the bottom line, thereby increasing earnings per share (EPS) and supporting a higher stock valuation.
*   **Timing:** The full impact will be realized over the next 12-24 months as memberships come up for renewal.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low:** $150 million increase in membership fee revenue in fiscal 2025.
    *   **Base:** $190 million increase in membership fee revenue in fiscal 2025.
    *   **High:** $220 million increase in membership fee revenue in fiscal 2025.

*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**

### **5) Prioritization & Scoring Table**

| ID | Title | Type | Timing (Near/Long) | Impact Score (1–5) | Probability Score (1–5) | Expected Impact (% Price Range) | Weighted Score |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | International Expansion | Operational | Long | 4 | 4 | 10-20% | 16 |
| 2 | Membership Fee Increase | Financial | Near | 3 | 5 | 2-5% | 15 |
| 3 | Special Dividend | Corporate Action | Near | 3 | 3 | 3-7% | 9 |

### **6) Timeline / Gantt (Concise)**

*   **Q1 2026:** Potential for special dividend announcement.
*   **Throughout 2025-2026:** Track new warehouse openings and performance.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Membership Fee Increase:**
*   **Base Case:** A $190 million increase in membership fee revenue, assuming a 25x price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, could add approximately $4.75 billion to Costco's market capitalization, representing a ~1.5% increase.

**2. International Expansion:**
*   **Base Case:** If Costco opens 29 new warehouses in 2025, and each new warehouse generates an average of $170 million in first-year sales, this would add approximately $4.93 billion in new revenue.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Costco are predominantly positive. The recent membership fee increase is a high-probability event that will provide a direct boost to earnings. The potential for a special dividend adds another layer of potential upside. While there are risks, such as a slowdown in consumer spending, the overall balance of catalysts in the 0-12 month timeframe appears to be positive.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Global Recession:** A deep and prolonged economic downturn could significantly impact consumer spending and membership renewals, negating the benefits of the fee increase and expansion plans.
2.  **Major Supply Chain Disruption:** A significant disruption to Costco's supply chain could lead to inventory shortages, higher costs, and damage to the company's reputation for value.
3.  **Intensified Competition:** Increased competition from online retailers and other warehouse clubs could pressure margins and limit growth opportunities.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Costco presents a compelling investment case with a mix of near-term and long-term catalysts. The recent membership fee increase is a key near-term driver that should provide a direct and high-probability boost to earnings. The potential for a special dividend adds further appeal. Long-term growth is supported by a steady pace of international expansion. The most important indicator to monitor is the company's ability to maintain high membership renewal rates in the face of the recent fee increase.
