### **Detailed Moat Assessment**

#### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** The value of a Planet Fitness membership to a user does not materially increase as more members join the network. While a large national footprint provides some benefit to PF Black Card members (who can use any location), this is a scale advantage, not a true network effect where user experience itself is enhanced by the presence of more users.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's value proposition is centered on individual access to a "Judgement Free Zone," not on interaction between members.
*   The PF Black Card allows access to all clubs system-wide, which is a feature of scale, but lacks the positive feedback loop of a network effect.
**Score:** 1 / 5

#### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for members are very low, which is a core part of the company's value proposition. While some memberships may have a cancellation fee, the company explicitly offers and requires franchisees to offer a non-committal membership option, minimizing customer lock-in. This low barrier to entry and exit is fundamental to attracting casual or first-time gym members.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states, "While some of our memberships require a cancellation fee, we offer, and require our franchisees to offer, a non-committal membership option." (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   Membership cancellation is a known risk, and the business depends on continually attracting new members to offset attrition.
**Score:** 1 / 5

#### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Planet Fitness exhibits a strong cost advantage through its asset-light franchise model and significant scale. The company's scale provides enhanced purchasing power for fitness equipment and other supplies, allowing it and its franchisees to operate at a lower cost base than smaller competitors. The no-frills operating model, which omits amenities like pools and group classes, further reduces both initial capital outlay and ongoing operating expenses.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, 2,445 of the 2,722 total clubs were franchised, minimizing direct capital expenditure for the parent company.
*   Planet Fitness's scale provides "enhanced purchasing power and extended warranties with our fitness equipment and other suppliers." (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The model excludes non-essential, high-cost amenities like "group exercise classes, pools, day care centers and juice bars," which allows for a more efficient use of its typical 20,000 square foot space. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5

#### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** The company's primary intangible asset is its powerful, nationally recognized brand, centered around the trademarked "Judgement Free Zone" concept. This branding effectively targets a large, underserved segment of the population that is often intimidated by traditional gym environments. The brand is reinforced by significant national and local advertising spending, totaling over USD 330 million in 2024.
**Evidence:**
*   Planet Fitness owns numerous registered trademarks, including "Planet Fitness," "Judgement Free Zone," and "No Gymtimidation." (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The company and its franchisees spent over USD 330 million on combined national and local advertising in 2024, demonstrating a significant investment in brand building. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The company states it has "among the highest aided and unaided brand awareness scores in the U.S. fitness industry, according to our Brand Health research." (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5

#### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** With 2,722 clubs across all 50 states and several countries, Planet Fitness has achieved a dense physical network that creates a significant barrier to entry. This scale, achieved primarily through a successful franchise model, creates localized economies of scale in marketing and brand awareness, making it difficult for new entrants to compete effectively in markets where Planet Fitness has a presence. The commitment from franchisees to open approximately 900 additional stores indicates this dense network will continue to expand.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the system consisted of 2,722 clubs, with locations in all 50 U.S. states. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   As of December 31, 2024, franchisees have contractual obligations under Area Development Agreements (ADAs) to open approximately 900 additional clubs. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The company believes it has the potential to grow to over 5,000 clubs in the U.S. alone, indicating significant runway for further density. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
**Score:** 5 / 5

#### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** Planet Fitness collects a significant amount of member data through its third-party club management system and its mobile app, which processes memberships, tracks visits, and logs workout activity. This data provides insights into member behavior and demographics, which can be used to optimize marketing and club operations. However, the evidence does not suggest this data creates a strong, self-reinforcing feedback loop that materially improves the product in a way competitors cannot replicate.
**Evidence:**
*   The company uses a third-party system to "track and analyze sales, membership statistics, cross-club utilization, member tenure, amenity usage, billing performance and demographic profiles by member." (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The Planet Fitness mobile app offers users improved capabilities to "track gym visits and workout activity," providing a source of user-generated data. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5

#### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Planet Fitness does not operate a strong ecosystem or platform model. While the company has a "PF Perks" program that offers discounts from third-party retail partners, this is a relatively simple partnership model rather than a true platform where third parties build businesses or services. There is no evidence of third-party developer adoption or a marketplace of complementary products that creates significant lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   The PF Perks program provides members with "special discounts, promotions and offers from certain brands and third-party retail partners," but this does not constitute a platform. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The business model is centered on the first-party offering of gym access and services, not on enabling third-party services.
**Score:** 1 / 5

#### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The health club industry is not subject to significant regulatory barriers that would prevent new competition. While Planet Fitness and its franchisees must comply with various consumer protection laws, labor laws, and health and safety regulations, these apply broadly to all industry participants and do not confer a unique advantage on the company. The company notes that tanning services are subject to an excise tax and regulations, but this is a minor part of the overall business.
**Evidence:**
*   The company is subject to FTC Franchise Rules and state franchise laws, which are standard for any franchise operator. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The business competes with a wide range of participants, including non-profit organizations, indicating low regulatory barriers to entry. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5

#### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The company itself operates an asset-light model by relying on franchisees to fund new club development, which requires significant capital investment from the franchisee. This structure creates a barrier to entry for potential franchisees and smaller operators who cannot commit the necessary capital for build-out and equipment. For a competitor to challenge Planet Fitness's scale, it would require an immense amount of coordinated capital, acting as a deterrent.
**Evidence:**
*   A substantial portion of new club development is funded by franchisee investment. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   Franchisees are required to purchase equipment from the company and replace it every five to nine years, representing a significant and specific capital requirement. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   The franchise model allows the company to "scale more rapidly than a predominantly company-owned strategy," leveraging franchisee capital to build its competitive footprint. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5

#### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** The business model is built on highly predictable, recurring revenue streams from monthly and annual membership fees. The company utilizes electronic funds transfer (EFT) for the vast majority of dues collection, leading to high revenue visibility and stability. Although individual contracts are short-term, the aggregate nature of millions of recurring memberships provides strong forward revenue visibility.
**Evidence:**
*   In 2024, approximately 90% of both corporate-owned club and franchise revenues consisted of recurring revenue streams. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   Approximately 82% of membership fee payments are collected via Automated Clearing House (ACH) direct debit, which provides a stable collection method. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company had approximately 19.7 million members providing a large base for recurring revenue. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (1 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.15 + 0.60 + 0.48 + 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.16 + 0.08 = **2.49**
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 62.25 / 100 (multiplying the 2.49 weighted score by 25 to scale it to 100)

### **Mapping to Moat Rating**
*   The numeric weighted score of 62.25 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range.
*   This corresponds to a final moat rating of 3.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is approximately 10–12 years. This durability is primarily supported by the company's strong brand recognition and its extensive, difficult-to-replicate physical footprint, which will take a competitor many years and significant capital to challenge. Franchise agreements have a typical term of 12 years, providing a long-term, stable royalty base and ensuring brand standards are maintained across the system for that duration.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Brand Damage:** The "Judgement Free Zone" brand is a powerful asset, but it is also vulnerable to incidents that contradict this image, which could rapidly erode consumer trust and preference if they receive negative publicity.
2.  **Shift in Consumer Preference:** A significant and sustained shift towards at-home fitness solutions (e.g., advanced digital content, VR fitness) or different types of boutique fitness could reduce the addressable market for a traditional, low-cost gym model.
3.  **Franchisee Distress:** A widespread economic downturn or significant increases in operating costs (labor, rent) could harm franchisee profitability, slowing new unit growth and potentially leading to brand standard degradation as franchisees cut costs.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
1.  **System-Wide Same Club Sales Growth:** A sustained deceleration could indicate market saturation, increased competition, or weakening brand appeal.
2.  **Net Member Growth & Average Members per Club:** Stagnation or decline would signal an inability to attract new members to offset natural attrition.
3.  **PF Black Card Penetration %:** A decline could indicate that the premium value proposition is weakening, impacting high-margin revenue.
4.  **New Franchisee-Owned Club Openings:** A slowdown in the pace of openings could signal franchisee reluctance to invest, potentially due to rising costs or declining unit economics.
5.  **Franchisee-Level Profitability/ROI (if disclosed):** Deteriorating franchisee returns are a leading indicator of systemic stress and future growth problems.
6.  **Brand Health Metrics:** Monitor third-party brand perception and awareness studies for any signs of decay in the "Judgement Free Zone" positioning.
7.  **Digital Membership Joins %:** An increase indicates successful digital marketing and a lower cost of member acquisition.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Planet Fitness has a moderate economic moat, justifying a 3/5 rating. Its primary strengths are a powerful, differentiated brand ("Judgement Free Zone") and a formidable, scaled distribution network that creates localized economies of scale and significant barriers to entry for competitors. These advantages are supported by a capital-light, highly profitable franchise model that generates predictable, recurring revenue. The moat is constrained, however, by virtually non-existent customer switching costs and a lack of network effects. A downgrade to the rating would be warranted if there is evidence of sustained brand damage, a material slowdown in new unit growth, or a persistent decline in same-store sales, suggesting its competitive advantages are eroding.

moat rating is 3 / 5
