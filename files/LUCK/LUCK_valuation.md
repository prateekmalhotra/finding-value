### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | 7.75% | Midpoint of management's "mid-single digits to 10%" guidance. (Q4 2024 Transcript, Sep 5, 2024). |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)** | 4.00% | Tapering down from initial guidance to a sustainable long-term rate, reflecting historical performance and industry maturity. |
| **EBIT Margin** | 13.0% | Based on TTM EBIT of $152.67M on revenue of $1,184M (12.9%), held flat as no specific initiatives for margin expansion were detailed beyond EBITDA targets. |
| **Tax Rate** | 21.0% | Standard U.S. corporate tax rate, used due to recent volatility in reported effective tax rates. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 12.0% | Based on Y1 guided capex of $154M on forecasted revenue of $1,276M (~12.1%). Kept stable as a proxy for growth and maintenance needs. |

| **Chg. in WC as % of Inc. Rev** | 20.0% | Reflects historical need to invest in working capital to support revenue growth. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| **Equity Value** | **($103M)**| `$2,861M - $3,043M + $79M` |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

Given the negative equity value derived from the high debt load, a conventional per-share value cannot be calculated. The analysis indicates that the company's debt obligations exceed the present value of its future cash flows under these base-case assumptions.

*   **Base Case Fair Value:** **$0.00** (Negative Equity Value)
*   **Low/Bear Case:** A scenario with lower growth (e.g., 2%) and margin compression (e.g., 11% EBIT margin) would result in a more significantly negative equity value.
*   **High/Bull Case:** A scenario with higher growth (e.g., 6%) and margin expansion (e.g., 15% EBIT margin) could potentially lead to a positive equity value, but the high leverage remains a critical risk factor.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** Not applicable due to negative base-case value.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **High Leverage:** The company's substantial debt load of over $3.0 billion is the most significant risk. The enterprise value is less than the total debt, meaning there is no residual value for equity holders in the base case.
2.  **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** The high debt level makes the company's profitability and cash flow highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, as a significant portion of operating income is consumed by interest expense.
3.  **Economic Cyclicality:** Lucky Strike's business is dependent on discretionary consumer spending, which can decline sharply during economic downturns, impacting revenue and the ability to service its debt.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation relies on achieving guided growth and maintaining margins. Any failure to execute on new builds, manage costs, or attract customers could lead to results below projections.
