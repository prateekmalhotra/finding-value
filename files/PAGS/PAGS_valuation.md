### B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION

After reviewing the latest available earnings call transcripts up to Q2 2025, no explicit, forward-looking quantitative guidance on revenue growth or specific margin targets was provided by management. Management commentary focused on continued execution, client base growth, and balancing growth with profitability. In the absence of specific targets, the valuation will rely on historical performance and stated strategic priorities.

### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

**1) Revenue Forecast:**
*   **Rationale:** With no explicit management guidance, a growth rate based on historical performance is appropriate. The TTM revenue growth is 14.52%. Given the law of large numbers and potential macro headwinds in Brazil, a conservative rate is prudent. A **10.0%** annual growth rate for Years 1-5 is assumed, representing a deceleration from the most recent period but still reflecting strong market positioning.
*   **Year 1-5 Revenue Growth:** 10.0% annually.

**2) Margin Path:**
*   **Rationale:** The TTM Operating Margin (EBIT Margin) is 34.6%. The average operating margin for the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024) is approximately 33.4%. Given the lack of specific management commentary on margin expansion initiatives, margins are assumed to remain stable at the recent TTM level.
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT % of Revenue):** 34.6% for Years 1-5.

**3) Taxes:**
*   **Rationale:** The TTM effective tax rate is 9.64%. The average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years (2022-2024) is 14.5%. The TTM rate is unusually low. To normalize, the 3-year average is a more conservative and realistic assumption for forecasting.
*   **Effective Tax Rate:** 14.5%.

**4) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** The 3-year average (2022-2024) capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 6.7%.
*   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled as 5.0% of incremental revenue, reflecting historical trends of investment needed to support growth.

**5) SBC and Dilution:**
*   **Stock-Based Compensation:** The 3-year average as a percentage of revenue is approximately 1.0%. This will be treated as a cash expense.
*   **Diluted Share Count:** 310 million shares.

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (BRL millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 21,240 | 23,364 | 25,700 | 28,270 | 31,097 |
| EBIT (34.6%) | 7,350 | 8,085 | 8,894 | 9,783 | 10,761 |
| EBIT \* (1-Tax Rate) | 6,284 | 6,913 | 7,604 | 8,364 | 9,201 |
| \+ D&A (9.0% of Rev) | 1,912 | 2,103 | 2,313 | 2,544 | 2,799 |
| \- SBC (1.0% of Rev) | (212) | (234) | (257) | (283) | (311) |
| \- Capex (6.7% of Rev) | (1,423) | (1,565) | (1,722) | (1,894) | (2,083) |
| \- ∆ in WC (5.0% of ∆Rev) | (97) | (106) | (117) | (129) | (141) |
| **FCFF** | **6,464** | **7,111** | **7,821** | **8,602** | **9,465** |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

**1) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate (Rf):** 4.31% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025). A country risk premium for Brazil of 3.5% is added, for an effective Rf of 7.81%.
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.5% (Standard market premium).
*   **Beta (β):** 1.56 (5-year monthly beta). This reflects higher volatility than the market, which is appropriate for a high-growth fintech in an emerging market.
*   **Cost of Equity (Ke) = Rf + β \* ERP** = 7.81% + 1.56 * 5.5% = **16.39%**

**2) Cost of Debt:**
*   **Interest Expense / Average Debt:** 3,970 / ((3,595 + 326)/2) = High and distorted due to liability structure. A synthetic rating is more appropriate. Assuming a pre-tax cost of debt of 10.0% to reflect credit risk in Brazil.
*   **After-Tax Cost of Debt (Kd) = Pre-tax Cost \* (1 - Tax Rate)** = 10.0% * (1 - 0.145) = **8.55%**

**3) WACC:**
*   **Market Cap (USD):** $2.77B (PAGS Stock Price $8.39 * 310M shares). Converted to BRL: R$15,235M (at ~5.5 BRL/USD).
*   **Market Value of Equity (E):** R$15,235M
*   **Market Value of Debt (D):** R$3,595M
*   **WACC = (E/(E+D)) \* Ke + (D/(E+D)) \* Kd** = (15235/18830) * 16.39% + (3595/18830) * 8.55% = **14.90%**

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

**1) Gordon Growth Method:**
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a realistic long-term assumption, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
*   **Terminal Value = (FCFF_Year5 \* (1+g)) / (WACC - g)** = (9,465 * 1.025) / (14.90% - 2.5%) = **R$78,197M**

**2) Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   A 5-10 year median multiple is not readily available. As a sanity check, a conservative 8.0x EV/EBITDA multiple is applied to Year 5 EBITDA.
*   **Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A** = 10,761 + 2,799 = R$13,560M
*   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 13,560 * 8.0** = R$108,480M
*   The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value and will be used.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** R$24,047M
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** R$39,114M (78,197 / (1.1490)^5)
*   **Enterprise Value (EV) = PV of FCFF + PV of TV** = 24,047 + 39,114 = **R$63,161M**
*   **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents** = 3,595 - 1,128 = R$2,467M
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt** = 63,161 - 2,467 = **R$60,694M**

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value (BRL) = Equity Value / Diluted Shares** = 60,694 / 310 = **R$195.79 per share**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value (USD)** (at 5.5 BRL/USD) = **$35.60 per share**

**Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case:** **$35.60**. Assumes 10% revenue growth and 34.6% EBIT margins.
*   **Low/Bear Case:** **$25.50**. Assumes 7% revenue growth and 32% EBIT margins, reflecting increased competition and macro pressure.
*   **High/Bull Case:** **$48.00**. Assumes 13% revenue growth and 36% EBIT margins, reflecting successful expansion and operating leverage.

**Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value is applied for a margin of safety.
*   **MOS Price = $35.60 \* (1 - 0.30) = $24.92**

### Risk Notes

1.  **Macroeconomic Risk:** As a Brazil-focused company, PAGS is highly sensitive to the country's economic stability, inflation, interest rates, and political climate.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The Brazilian fintech market is intensely competitive, with numerous players vying for market share, which could pressure take rates and margins.
3.  **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in financial regulations, particularly concerning payment systems, interchange fees, and credit provisioning, could materially impact the business model.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The company's ability to continue innovating, growing its banking ecosystem, and managing credit risk effectively is crucial to achieving forecasted growth.
