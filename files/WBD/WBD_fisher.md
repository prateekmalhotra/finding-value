**Company:** Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (WBD)
**Date of Analysis:** August 24, 2025
**Primary Sources Reviewed:** Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2024.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Warner Bros. Discovery's direct-to-consumer (DTC) streaming services, particularly Max, represent a significant growth area. The company has been expanding Max into new international markets, launching in 73 new territories across Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Asia in 2024, which contributed to a 20% increase in DTC subscribers to 116.9 million by the end of the year. While the U.S. streaming market is mature, international markets offer substantial room for growth. The company's vast content library, including iconic franchises like Harry Potter and DC Comics, provides a strong foundation for attracting and retaining subscribers globally.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** WBD's management has demonstrated a commitment to developing its streaming products and content pipeline. The launch of Max in numerous international markets in 2024 and planned additional launches in 2025 and 2026 underscore this commitment. The company is also investing in new content, with highly anticipated new seasons of popular shows like "The White Lotus" and "The Last of Us" planned for 2025, alongside new series premieres. This continuous investment in content and global expansion of its streaming platform indicates a clear strategy for future growth beyond traditional linear networks.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a media and entertainment company, WBD's "R&D" is primarily focused on content creation and technology for its streaming platforms. The company does not report traditional R&D expenses, but its investments in technology are evident in the development and global rollout of its Max streaming service. The successful integration of HBO Max and discovery+ into a single platform and its subsequent international expansion demonstrate effective execution in this area. However, without specific R&D spending figures, a direct comparison to peers is difficult. The company's focus is more on content investment, where its effectiveness can be measured by subscriber growth and engagement.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** No specific R&D spending is detailed in the provided filings.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** WBD's sales organization is multifaceted, encompassing advertising sales, distribution deals for its linear networks, and direct-to-consumer subscriptions. The company's ability to secure distribution agreements with major cable, satellite, and digital providers globally is a testament to its sales effectiveness. However, the company has faced headwinds in the U.S. linear advertising market, with a 7% decline in advertising revenue in 2024, primarily due to audience declines in domestic linear networks. On the other hand, the 20% growth in DTC subscribers in 2024 indicates a successful direct-to-consumer sales effort. The mixed performance across different sales channels suggests an average, rather than above-average, sales organization at the consolidated level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Warner Bros. Discovery reported an operating loss of over $10 billion, largely due to a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $9.1 billion in its Networks segment. Even excluding this charge, the company's profitability has been under pressure. The DTC segment, while growing, is still in an investment phase and has historically been a drag on profitability, though it did show positive Adjusted EBITDA in 2024. The legacy Networks segment, while profitable, is in secular decline. The company's overall profitability is not yet at a level that could be considered "worthwhile" in the Fisher sense.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Since the merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery, the company has been aggressively focused on cost-saving initiatives and synergies. The company has undertaken significant restructuring and transformation initiatives, including strategic content programming assessments, organization restructuring, and facility consolidation activities, with a goal of achieving significant cost synergies. The company is also focused on improving the profitability of its DTC segment by offering ad-supported tiers and managing content spend more efficiently. The planned split of the company into two separate entities is also aimed at unlocking shareholder value and improving the strategic focus and financial performance of each division.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K notes the material impact of the 2023 WGA and SAG-AFTRA strikes on its operations. While these were industry-wide strikes, the prolonged nature of the disputes suggests that relations between the studios, including WBD, and their creative talent could be improved. The company has implemented restructuring and transformation initiatives, including headcount reductions, which can negatively impact employee morale. While the 10-K outlines a commitment to competitive compensation and benefits, the recent labor disruptions and restructuring activities prevent a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Warner Bros. Discovery appears to be stable at the highest level, with David Zaslav as CEO and Gunnar Wiedenfels as CFO, both of whom have been with the company since the merger. The 2024 10-K lists a consistent team of executive officers. However, the planned corporate reorganization into two distinct operating divisions could lead to changes in executive leadership and responsibilities. While there is no public evidence of major discord, the significant strategic shifts and restructuring could create internal friction.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Warner Bros. Discovery has a deep bench of experienced executives leading its various divisions. The 2024 10-K lists several key executives beyond the CEO and CFO, including leaders for Global Streaming and Games, and International. The company's segment structure, with dedicated leadership for Studios, Networks, and DTC, also suggests a decentralized management approach that relies on experienced leaders in each area. The planned reorganization into two divisions will likely further clarify management responsibilities and highlight the depth of leadership within each new entity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from management on internal control over financial reporting, stating that management concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The detailed segment reporting and the ongoing focus on cost synergies and restructuring suggest a strong emphasis on cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the media and entertainment industry, the quality and depth of a company's content library and intellectual property (IP) are crucial competitive advantages. WBD possesses one of the most extensive and valuable content libraries in the world, with iconic franchises such as DC Comics, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones. This vast IP portfolio provides a strong foundation for creating new content, attracting subscribers to its streaming services, and generating revenue through licensing and consumer products. The ability to leverage this IP across its various platforms (film, television, streaming, games) gives WBD a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's significant investment in its DTC segment, including the global rollout of Max, indicates a focus on long-term growth, even at the expense of short-term profitability. The company has incurred substantial costs related to the merger and subsequent restructuring, with the goal of creating a more efficient and competitive company for the long term. The planned separation of the company into two distinct divisions is another strategic move aimed at unlocking long-term value. This willingness to undergo significant transformation and investment suggests a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Warner Bros. Discovery had approximately $3.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents and a significant amount of debt. The company has been focused on paying down debt since the merger. Given its substantial cash flow from operations, the company appears to have sufficient financial flexibility to fund its growth initiatives, such as the international expansion of Max and content production, without needing to issue additional equity. Management's focus has been on debt reduction, not equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000096/disca-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000096/disca-20250331.htm) (May 8, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management, particularly CEO David Zaslav, is known for being very direct and transparent in earnings calls and investor presentations. The company has openly discussed the challenges in the linear advertising market, the costs associated with the merger and restructuring, and the strategic rationale behind its decisions. The detailed segment reporting and the willingness to provide forward-looking commentary, even when the outlook is challenging, suggest a high degree of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Based on a general assessment of the tone and content of the provided SEC filings. A review of earnings call transcripts would provide more direct evidence.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant legal or regulatory issues mentioned in the recent SEC filings that would call into question the integrity of the company's management. The company is subject to various legal proceedings, as is typical for a company of its size, but there is no indication of widespread fraud or malfeasance. The 2024 10-K notes the presence of shareholder lawsuits related to the merger, but these are not uncommon in large corporate transactions. Without evidence to the contrary, management's integrity is presumed to be sound.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1437107/000143710725000031/wbd-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Warner Bros. Discovery presents a mixed but improving picture under Fisher's 15 points. The company's strongest positives are its world-class content library and intellectual property, its commitment to the long-term growth of its direct-to-consumer business, and its strong cost analysis and accounting controls. The primary negatives are its current lack of profitability, the challenges in its legacy linear networks business, and recent labor disruptions. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful international expansion and monetization of the Max streaming service, the outcome of the planned corporate reorganization, and a potential recovery in the advertising market. A sustained period of profitability in the DTC segment and a stabilization of the linear networks business would be the most significant evidence to flip the "No" answers on profit margins and sales organization to "Yes."

**fisher score is 9 / 15**
