This trend is expected to continue as global travel markets normalize and Trip.com expands its market share.

    *   **Timing:** August 27, 2025 (Q2 2025 earnings) - August 2026.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** 30% YoY growth in international OTA bookings.
        *   **Base Scenario:** 50% YoY growth in international OTA bookings.
        *   **High Scenario:** 70% YoY growth in international OTA bookings.

    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued global economic stability, no major new travel restrictions, and successful marketing and product localization efforts.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** International OTA platform booking growth (reported in quarterly earnings), revenue from international markets, and market share data in key international regions.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A global economic slowdown could dampen travel demand. Increased competition from other global OTAs. Geopolitical tensions could disrupt travel patterns.

        *   **High Scenario:** Over 20% YoY revenue growth and a significant beat on EPS, with strong Q3 guidance.

**4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

    *   **Timing:** 2025-2027.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** Inbound travel to China recovers to 70% of pre-pandemic levels.

**7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Catalyst: AI-Driven Efficiency and User Engagement**
*   **Base Case:** Assume a 3% improvement in operating margin due to AI-driven efficiencies on a projected 2026 revenue of RMB 60 billion. This would add RMB 1.8 billion to operating income. At a 15x P/E multiple and a 20% tax rate, this could add approximately RMB 21.6 billion (US$3 billion) to the company's market capitalization, or roughly a **7-8% increase** in share price from the current market cap of ~$40B.
*   **High Case:** Assume a 5% improvement in operating margin on the same revenue base. This would add RMB 3 billion to operating income. At a 15x P/E multiple and a 20% tax rate, this could add approximately RMB 36 billion (US$5 billion) to the company's market capitalization, or a **12-13% increase** in share price.

**2. Catalyst: Expansion of Visa-Free Policies for Inbound China Travel**
*   **Base Case:** Assume a full recovery of inbound travel to pre-pandemic levels, adding an incremental RMB 5 billion in high-margin revenue by 2026. Assuming a 30% incremental operating margin, this would add RMB 1.5 billion to operating income. At a 15x P/E multiple and a 20% tax rate, this could add approximately RMB 18 billion (US$2.5 billion) to the company's market capitalization, or a **6-7% increase** in share price.
*   **High Case:** Assume inbound travel surpasses pre-pandemic levels by 20%, adding an incremental RMB 6 billion in revenue. With the same margin assumptions, this would add RMB 1.8 billion to operating income, resulting in a potential market cap increase of RMB 21.6 billion (US$3 billion), or a **7-8% increase** in share price.

**8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The net balance of catalysts for Trip.com Group in the near-term (0–12 months) appears positive. The company is experiencing strong momentum in its international business, which should be a key driver of growth in the upcoming quarters. The upcoming Q2 2025 earnings report on August 27, 2025, is a key near-term event that could provide a positive surprise. While there has been some insider selling, this is not unusual for a growth company and is outweighed by the positive operational and financial trends. The overall short-term market signal is bullish, with the potential for continued upside in the stock price.
