### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

#### **Catalyst 1: Profit Recovery & Growth Plan (PRGP) Execution**

*   **Catalyst Title:** Successful execution of the expanded Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP).
*   **Type:** Operational / Financial.
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On February 3, 2025, the Company committed to an expansion of its PRGP, which is now expected to yield annual gross benefits of between $800 million and $1,000 million. The expanded plan focuses on procurement, supply chain efficiencies, and outsourcing of select services.
*   **Mechanism:** The realization of cost savings from the PRGP will directly improve gross and operating margins, leading to higher net income. This will, in turn, increase earnings per share (EPS) and free cash flow, which are key drivers of stock valuation. A return to double-digit operating margins would likely lead to a significant re-rating of the stock by the market.
*   **Timing:** The expanded component of the restructuring program will begin during the Company's fiscal 2025 third quarter, with all initiatives to be approved by the end of fiscal 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** $800 million in annual gross benefits.
    *   **Base Scenario:** $900 million in annual gross benefits.
    *   **High Scenario:** $1,000 million in annual gross benefits.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A successful execution of the PRGP could restore the company's operating margin to the mid-teens, which, combined with a modest sales recovery, could justify a stock price well above current levels.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. Management has a track record of executing restructuring plans, and the expanded PRGP is a key strategic priority. The CEO has emphasized a focus on "rebuilding stronger, more sustainable profitability."
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful renegotiation of supplier contracts, smooth outsourcing transitions, and maintaining employee morale during the workforce reduction.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    1.  Quarterly reports on restructuring charges and progress toward savings targets (in 10-Q filings).
    2.  Gross margin and operating margin trends.
    3.  Commentary on supply chain efficiency and procurement in earnings calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  Execution missteps leading to supply chain disruptions.
    2.  Employee morale issues impacting productivity.
    3.  Savings being offset by unforeseen cost inflation.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The potential upside is significant, but investors should monitor the initial results of the expanded PRGP closely.

#### **Catalyst 2: Insider Buying by Executives and Directors**

*   **Catalyst Title:** Significant open-market purchases of EL stock by insiders.
*   **Type:** Corporate Action.
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Several insiders have made large open-market purchases of EL stock in late 2024 and early 2025, signaling their confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Mechanism:** Insider buying is often interpreted by the market as a strong signal that those with the most information about the company believe the stock is undervalued. This can attract other investors and create positive momentum in the stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing. Recent purchases were made in February 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Director Paul J Fribourg purchased 45,500 shares on February 7, 2025, and 87,000 shares on February 5, 2025.
    *   EVP and CFO Akhil Shrivastava purchased 700 shares on February 5, 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). While not a fundamental driver of value, a continuation of significant insider buying can have a strong positive impact on investor sentiment.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The recent purchases are a matter of public record.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continuation of insider buying, and a lack of significant insider selling.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    1.  SEC Form 4 filings from EL insiders.
    2.  Openinsider.com for aggregated insider trading data.
    3.  Changes in the holdings of key executives and directors.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  A sudden shift to insider selling would be a strong negative signal.
    2.  The impact of insider buying could be muted if the company's financial performance continues to disappoint.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The recent insider buying provides a strong signal of undervaluation from those who know the company best.

#### **Catalyst 3: Dividend Increase**

*   **Catalyst Title:** A return to dividend growth, signaling renewed financial strength.
*   **Type:** Corporate Action.
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a history of paying dividends, but the quarterly dividend was reduced in late 2024. A resumption of dividend growth would be a strong signal to investors that the PRGP is succeeding and that management is confident in the company's future cash flows.
*   **Mechanism:** A dividend increase would signal to the market that the company's financial position is improving and that management is confident in the sustainability of its earnings. This would likely attract income-oriented investors and could lead to a higher valuation multiple for the stock.
*   **Timing:** An increase could be announced as early as the first half of 2026, depending on the progress of the PRGP.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   The most recent dividend was $0.35 per share, declared on February 3, 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (0-10%). A dividend increase would be a positive signal, but the direct impact on the stock price is likely to be less than the impact of the PRGP execution itself.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a strong history of returning cash to shareholders, and a dividend increase would be a logical step once the PRGP gains traction.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful execution of the PRGP and a stabilization of the company's earnings and cash flows.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    1.  Quarterly dividend announcements.
    2.  Free cash flow generation.
    3.  Management commentary on capital allocation in earnings calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  A further dividend cut would be a major negative signal.
    2.  A delay in resuming dividend growth could disappoint investors.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. A dividend increase would be a confirmation of a successful turnaround, but it is not a primary reason to own the stock at this point.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

#### **Catalyst 4: Resumption of Share Repurchases**

*   **Catalyst Title:** Reinstatement of the share repurchase program.
*   **Type:** Corporate Action.
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company suspended its share repurchase program in December 2022. A resumption of share buybacks would be a strong signal of confidence and would provide another avenue for returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of shares outstanding, which increases earnings per share. This can lead to a higher stock price, all else being equal. A significant buyback program can also create a floor for the stock price.
*   **Timing:** Likely to be considered after the dividend is increased, so potentially in late 2026 or 2027.
*   **Quantification:** The company has a history of significant share repurchases, and a return to this practice would be a positive catalyst.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). A sustained share repurchase program could provide a significant boost to the stock price over the long term.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. Dependent on the success of the PRGP and the company's ability to generate excess free cash flow.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Sustained free cash flow generation and a stable to improving business outlook.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    1.  Company announcements regarding the share repurchase program.
    2.  Free cash flow generation.
    3.  Shares outstanding in quarterly reports.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  A failure to resume the buyback program could be seen as a lack of confidence.
    2.  Repurchasing shares at an inflated price would destroy shareholder value.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The resumption of share repurchases would be a strong long-term positive, but it is not an immediate catalyst.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

#### **Catalyst 1: Profit Recovery & Growth Plan (PRGP) Execution**

*   **Base Case:** $900 million in annual gross benefits. Assuming a 21% tax rate and a P/E multiple of 20x, this would add approximately $14.2 billion to the company's market capitalization.
*   **Formula:** (Annual Gross Benefits \* (1 - Tax Rate)) \* P/E Multiple = (900,000,000 \* 0.79) \* 20 = $14,220,000,000
*   **Citation:** PRGP benefits, tax rate inferred from recent financials.

#### **Catalyst 2: Dividend Increase**

*   **Base Case:** A restoration of the quarterly dividend to its previous level of $0.66 per share would result in a forward dividend yield of approximately 2.0% at a stock price of $132.
*   **Formula:** (Quarterly Dividend \* 4) / Stock Price = (0.66 \* 4) / 132 = 0.02
*   **Citation:** Previous dividend rate.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for EL are predominantly positive, with the successful execution of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan (PRGP) being the most significant driver. The recent insider buying provides a strong signal of confidence from management. While a dividend increase is not a certainty, it would be a powerful confirmation of the turnaround. The overall balance of near-term catalysts suggests a positive outlook for the stock in the next 0-12 months.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failure of the PRGP:** If the company fails to achieve the targeted cost savings from the PRGP, it could lead to a significant loss of investor confidence and a further decline in the stock price.
2.  **Continued Weakness in China:** A prolonged downturn in the Chinese economy and travel retail market could offset any gains from the PRGP and continue to weigh on the company's sales and profitability.
3.  **Increased Competition:** A significant increase in competitive pressures, particularly from newer, more agile brands, could erode EL's market share and pricing power.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on this analysis, the primary catalyst for EL is the successful execution of the Profit Recovery and Growth Plan. The recent insider buying provides a strong signal of undervaluation, and a dividend increase would be a confirmation of a successful turnaround. A conservative estimate of the potential upside from the PRGP is in the range of 30-50% over the next 12-24 months. The single most important indicator to monitor is the company's progress toward its margin improvement targets, as detailed in its quarterly earnings reports.
