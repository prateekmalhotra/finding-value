### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** CarMax exhibits weak, indirect network effects. A larger national inventory increases the selection for buyers, and the ability to transfer vehicles (38% of sales in FY2025) enhances this value. A larger pool of sellers, attracted by CarMax's buying program, feeds this inventory, creating a modest flywheel. However, the value for a new customer does not increase directly with each additional user, as it would in a classic digital network.
**Evidence:**
*   CarMax's national inventory of approximately 73,000 vehicles is a key value proposition for customers. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   In fiscal 2025, approximately 38% of retail vehicles sold were transferred from other stores at a customer's request, demonstrating the value of the national network. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   CarMax is the largest used vehicle buyer from consumers in the U.S., purchasing approximately 1.2 million vehicles from consumers and dealers in fiscal 2025, which directly supplies its retail and wholesale channels. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Switching costs are nonexistent for CarMax's retail customers. The business is transactional, and customers can easily shop at competing dealers or online platforms for their next purchase without financial, technical, or procedural penalties. While CarMax's integrated financing (CAF) and EPPs offer convenience, they do not create meaningful lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is based on individual vehicle sales transactions with no contractual lock-in for future purchases. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company offers a 3-day payoff option on all financing, allowing customers to easily refinance with another provider at no charge, explicitly minimizing any financial lock-in. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** CarMax has a moderate cost advantage derived from its scale in vehicle acquisition and reconditioning. By sourcing a significant portion of its inventory directly from consumers rather than auctions, it generally acquires vehicles at a lower cost. Centralized and in-house reconditioning operations also create efficiencies, though the company is still focused on driving further savings.
**Evidence:**
*   In fiscal 2025, CarMax purchased approximately 1.2 million vehicles from consumers and dealers, providing a more profitable sourcing channel than auctions. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company reported a record high retail gross profit per used unit of $2,407 in Q1 FY2026, suggesting strong cost management in acquiring and reconditioning vehicles relative to their selling price. (Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, June 20, 2025)
*   CarMax is pursuing cost efficiencies, achieving savings of ~$125 per unit in FY2025 with a target for another $125 per unit in FY2026, indicating a focus on lowering unit costs. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** CarMax has a very strong and differentiated brand built over decades, centered on a "no-haggle," transparent, and customer-friendly experience. This reputation is a significant intangible asset that drives customer traffic and trust in a notoriously opaque industry. While its proprietary software is important, the brand is the primary intangible asset.
**Evidence:**
*   CarMax has been recognized for 21 consecutive years as one of Fortune magazine's "100 Best Companies to Work For," which reflects and supports its positive brand culture. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company's marketing promotes its brand promise, including the "Love Your Car Guarantee" with a 10-day money-back guarantee, which reinforces customer trust. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company's stated purpose is "to drive integrity by being honest and transparent in every interaction," which is the foundation of its brand value. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** This is CarMax's strongest moat source. The company's nationwide footprint of 250 large-format stores, supplemented by stand-alone reconditioning and auction centers, represents an immense, hard-to-replicate physical logistics network. This scale allows it to efficiently source, recondition, and retail vehicles in a way that is prohibitive for new entrants to match.
**Evidence:**
*   As of February 28, 2025, CarMax operated 250 used car stores in 109 U.S. television markets, covering approximately 85% of the U.S. population. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The physical store network is essential to the omni-channel model, as many customers prefer to see vehicles in person and it facilitates test drives, trade-ins, and deliveries. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Capital expenditures were $467.9 million in fiscal 2025 and are planned to be approximately $575 million in fiscal 2026, demonstrating the significant and ongoing investment required to maintain and expand this physical footprint. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 5 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** CarMax possesses a significant data advantage from over 30 years of buying and selling millions of used cars. This proprietary dataset fuels its pricing algorithms, appraisal offers, and inventory management systems, allowing for optimized inventory turns and profitability. This data creates a clear feedback loop: more transactions refine the algorithms, which improves pricing and sales, generating more data.
**Evidence:**
*   CarMax utilizes a proprietary centralized inventory management and pricing system that leverages over thirty years of experience to generate recommended price points and markdowns based on algorithms. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   CarMax Auto Finance (CAF) uses proprietary scoring models based on historical experience to predict repayment likelihood, which are optimized for the CarMax sales channel specifically. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company is leveraging data science and AI to enhance digital experiences, such as its virtual assistant "Skye," which improves efficiency and the customer journey. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** CarMax operates more as an integrated retailer than a true ecosystem or platform. While it has its own financing arm (CAF) and sells third-party EPPs, it does not have a marketplace for complementary third-party products or a developer platform. The acquisition of Edmunds provides a content and data platform, but it is primarily used to funnel customers to the core CarMax retail offering rather than to foster a third-party ecosystem.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as two reportable segments: CarMax Sales Operations and CarMax Auto Finance (CAF), indicating an integrated model, not a platform of third-party services. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Third-party finance providers and EPP providers are described as partners or vendors, not as participants in a developer or services ecosystem. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The used vehicle industry is highly regulated, requiring dealer, service, and finance licenses in every state of operation. While these regulations impose compliance costs, they apply to all competitors and do not provide a unique, durable advantage to CarMax. The barriers to entry are more related to capital and scale than to a proprietary license or patent.
**Evidence:**
*   "In every state in which we operate, we must obtain licenses and permits to conduct business, including dealer, service, sales, transportation and finance licenses issued by state and local regulatory authorities." (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The business is subject to a wide range of federal, state, and local laws (e.g., consumer protection, environmental, employment) that govern the industry as a whole. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** The business is extremely capital intensive, which creates a high barrier to entry and deters competition. A competitor would need to invest billions of dollars over many years to replicate CarMax's physical footprint of stores, reconditioning centers, and inventory. This level of sunk cost and asset specificity is a powerful deterrent.
**Evidence:**
*   As of February 28, 2025, CarMax held $3.93 billion in vehicle inventory and $3.84 billion in net property and equipment. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Capital expenditures are consistently high, planned at approximately $575 million for fiscal 2026, primarily for land purchases and construction of stores and reconditioning facilities. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 5 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** CarMax's revenue is entirely transactional, based on one-time vehicle sales. There is no recurring revenue from contracts, subscriptions, or other long-term agreements that would provide visibility into future earnings. This dimension is not a source of competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's revenue is derived from the sale of used vehicles, wholesale vehicles, and other related products and services at the point of sale. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   There is no mention of recurring revenue models, subscriptions, or long-term customer contracts in the description of the business. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(1 * 0.18) + (0 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (5 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.0 + 0.45 + 0.48 + 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.20 + 0.0 = **2.35**

*Note: The prompt provides a weighted score calculation based on a 0-100 scale. However, the calculation above results in a score on a 0-5 scale. To align with the provided thresholds, I will multiply the weighted score by 20.*

Adjusted Weighted Score = 2.35 * 20 = **47.0 / 100**

### Mapping
The numeric weighted score of 47.0 falls within the 30-50 range.
*   30 ≤ Weighted < 50 → moat rating = 2

*Correction*: Re-reading the prompt, the weighted score is a sum of (score * weight), not a simple average. Let's recalculate based on the provided weights.
(1 * 18) + (0 * 15) + (3 * 15) + (4 * 12) + (5 * 10) + (4 * 10) + (1 * 8) + (1 * 6) + (5 * 4) + (0 * 2) = 18 + 0 + 45 + 48 + 50 + 40 + 8 + 6 + 20 + 0 = **235**

This calculation does not seem right. The weights are percentages. The calculation should be:
(1 * 0.18) + (0 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (5 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 2.35. Let's assume the weighted score is on a 5 point scale and the thresholds provided are for a 100-point scale. So, a score of 2.35 out of 5 is equivalent to 47 out of 100. Let's try another way. If the weights are points:
(1*18) + (0*15) + (3*15) + (4*12) + (5*10) + (4*10) + (1*8) + (1*6) + (5*4) + (0*2) = 235.
Let's divide by the maximum possible score: (5*18)+(5*15)+(5*15)+(5*12)+(5*10)+(5*10)+(5*8)+(5*6)+(5*4)+(5*2) = 90+75+75+60+50+50+40+30+20+10 = 500. So 235/500 = 47%. This is the weighted score.

**Final Weighted Score Calculation:**
*   Network Effects: 1 * 18 = 18
*   Switching Costs: 0 * 15 = 0
*   Cost Advantage: 3 * 15 = 45
*   Intangible Assets: 4 * 12 = 48
*   Distribution & Scale: 5 * 10 = 50
*   Data Advantage: 4 * 10 = 40
*   Ecosystem Effects: 1 * 8 = 8
*   Regulatory Barriers: 1 * 6 = 6
*   Capital Intensity: 5 * 4 = 20
*   Customer Contracts: 0 * 2 = 0
*   **Total Weighted Score:** 18 + 0 + 45 + 48 + 50 + 40 + 8 + 6 + 20 + 0 = **235**. The maximum score is 500. Let's convert this to a 100-point scale: 235 / 5 = **47.0 / 100**

This weighted score of 47.0 maps to a moat rating of 2.
*   30 ≤ 47.0 < 50 → **moat rating = 2**

Wait, let's re-read the prompt on scoring. "Compute a weighted score = sum(score_dim * weight_dim)". The weights are given as percentages. So it should be `sum(score * weight_as_decimal)`. This gives 2.35. Then, "Convert weighted score (0-100) to a 0-5 moat rating". This implies the weighted score should be on a 0-100 scale. So, `sum(score_dim * weight_as_integer)`.
1*18 + 3*15 + 4*12 + 5*10 + 4*10 + 1*8 + 1*6 + 5*4 = 18 + 45 + 48 + 50 + 40 + 8 + 6 + 20 = **235**. The total weight is 100. This calculation is incorrect.

Let's assume the score is normalized. Max possible weighted score is 5. `2.35 / 5 = 0.47`. Let's assume this is the percentage score. **47.0 / 100**. This maps to a moat rating of 2.

Let me try a different calculation. The weights sum to 100. Max score is 5. So, the maximum weighted score would be 5 * 100 = 500. My calculated score is 235. This yields a percentage of 235/500 = 47%. This looks right.

**Final Weighted Score:** **47.0 / 100**
This maps to **moat rating = 2**

However, looking at the strength of the brand, data, and especially the distribution/scale and capital intensity, a score of 2 feels too low. Let me re-evaluate my dimension scores with a very conservative lens.
*   Network Effects: 1. Correct.
*   Switching Costs: 0. Correct.
*   Cost Advantage: 3. Seems fair. Not dominant but scale helps.
*   Intangible Assets / Brand: 4. Very strong brand.
*   Distribution & Efficient Scale: 5. Unmatched physical footprint.
*   Data Advantage: 4. Decades of proprietary data.
*   Ecosystem: 1. Correct.
*   Regulatory: 1. Correct.
*   Capital Intensity: 5. Extremely high barrier to entry.
*   Customer Contracts: 0. Correct.

The scores seem correct. The weights heavily favor Network Effects and Switching Costs, where CarMax is weak. Let me try an adjusted weighting scheme as allowed by the prompt.

**Industry-Specific Weighting Rationale:** For a capital-intensive, physical retail business like used cars, the most durable advantages come from physical scale and brand trust, not network effects or switching costs which are more suited to software/platform businesses. I will adjust the weights to reflect this reality, increasing Distribution, Capital Intensity, and Brand, while decreasing Network Effects and Switching Costs.

| Dimension | Default Wt% | Adjusted Wt% | Raw Score | Adj. Weighted Contrib. |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Distribution & Efficient Scale | 10% | 20% | 5 | 100 |
| Intangible Assets / Brand / IP | 12% | 18% | 4 | 72 |
| Cost Advantage | 15% | 15% | 3 | 45 |
| Data Advantage | 10% | 12% | 4 | 48 |
| Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity | 4% | 10% | 5 | 50 |
| Network Effects | 18% | 8% | 1 | 8 |
| Switching Costs | 15% | 2% | 0 | 0 |
| Ecosystem / Platform Effects | 8% | 5% | 1 | 5 |
| Regulatory / Legal Barriers | 6% | 5% | 1 | 5 |
| Customer Contracts | 2% | 5% | 0 | 0 |
| **Total** | **100%** | **100%** | | **333** |

Adjusted Weighted Score = **333 / 500** = **66.6 / 100**.
This maps to a moat rating of 3.
*   50 ≤ 66.6 < 70 → **moat rating = 3**

This feels more appropriate. I will present the default score and then the adjusted score and final rating. No, the prompt says "show both default and adjusted weighted results". I will proceed with the default weighting as it is the primary instruction, and a score of 2 is the conservative, evidence-first outcome based on the provided framework. I must stick to the framework. The framework's heavy weighting on network effects and switching costs penalizes this business model, and my role is to apply the framework as given.

**Final Weighted Score (Default Weights): 47.0 / 100**
Mapping: 30 ≤ 47.0 < 50 maps to a moat rating of 2.

### Moat Duration Justification
The moat's durability stems from advantages that are difficult and time-consuming to erode: the nationwide physical footprint and the trusted brand. A competitor would require a decade or more and billions in capital to replicate the 250-store network. The brand's reputation for transparency is also the result of over 30 years of consistent strategy. These factors suggest a durable advantage, likely in the 8-12 year range, before competitive pressures from online-first retailers or shifts in vehicle ownership models could significantly degrade its position.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Online-First Competitor Achieves Scale:** A well-capitalized, online-native competitor could continue to grow market share without the heavy capital burden of physical stores, using a more variable cost structure that could allow for lower prices, eroding CarMax's scale advantage over time. (Form 10-K Risk Factors, Feb 28, 2025)
2.  **Economic Downturn Reduces Demand:** A severe recession could disproportionately harm the used car market, reducing demand and compressing margins. This would threaten CarMax's ability to leverage its high fixed costs associated with its store footprint, negatively impacting profitability. (Form 10-K Risk Factors, Feb 28, 2025)
3.  **Shift in Automotive Technology:** A rapid consumer shift to Electric Vehicles (EVs) could challenge CarMax's expertise and infrastructure for sourcing, reconditioning, and servicing vehicles, creating an opening for specialized competitors or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to dominate the used EV market. (Form 10-K Risk Factors, Feb 28, 2025)

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Retail Gross Profit Per Used Unit:** A decline could indicate pricing pressure or rising acquisition/reconditioning costs. Current: $2,407 (Q1 FY26).
*   **SG&A as a % of Gross Profit:** An increase would signal a loss of operating leverage. Current: Leveraged by 680 basis points in Q1 FY26.
*   **Comparable Store Used Unit Sales Growth:** A negative trend would indicate market share loss or weakening demand. Current: +8.1% (Q1 FY26).
*   **Inventory Turns:** A slowdown could signal weakening demand or poor pricing, leading to depreciation risk.
*   **CAF Net Penetration Rate:** A significant decline could indicate uncompetitive financing offers, potentially impacting sales conversion. Current: 41.8% (Q1 FY26).
*   **Vehicles Sourced from Consumers vs. Auctions:** A decreasing mix of consumer-sourced cars could increase acquisition costs and lower margins.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
CarMax possesses a moderate moat, assigning a rating of 2 out of 5 based on the prescribed analytic framework. The company's primary competitive advantages are its unmatched national distribution network and the significant capital intensity required to replicate it, which together form a formidable barrier to entry. These strengths are complemented by a trusted, no-haggle brand and a robust data advantage in pricing and appraisals. However, the company is fundamentally weak in dimensions heavily weighted by the model, such as network effects and switching costs, as its business is transactional. An increase in the rating would require evidence of growing customer lock-in or a fundamental shift to a more platform-based business model.

moat rating is 2 / 5
