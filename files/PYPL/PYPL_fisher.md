Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Annual Report (Form 10-K filed February 4, 2025), Q2 2025 Quarterly Report (Form 10-Q filed July 29, 2025), and various 2024-2025 earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal operates within the vast and expanding digital payments market, which serves as a long-term tailwind. The company processed $1.68 trillion in Total Payment Volume (TPV) in 2024, a 10% increase from 2023. The company is focused on expanding its value proposition for consumers and merchants to drive daily use, accelerating growth in its branded checkout business, and increasing offline engagement through branded debit/credit cards and rewards programs. These initiatives, coupled with the ongoing shift from cash to digital payments, suggest a significant runway for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's strategy explicitly includes "seeking new areas of growth" by "creating new products in both the digital and physical worlds and finding opportunities to expand and improve upon our existing products and capabilities." Recent initiatives include expanding buy now, pay later solutions, offering cryptocurrency services, and launching the PayPal USD stablecoin. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, management highlighted a focus on innovation to improve the customer experience and drive engagement.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal's research and development expenses were $1.5 billion in 2024, down from $1.6 billion in 2023 and $1.7 billion in 2022. While R&D spending has decreased, the company continues to launch new products and features. The effectiveness of these efforts is mixed. While PayPal has successfully launched and scaled products like its buy now, pay later solutions, it faces intense competition and will need to demonstrate a consistent ability to innovate and capture market share.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal’s two-sided network serves 434 million active accounts. The company's sales and marketing expenses increased to $2.0 billion in 2024, up from $1.8 billion in 2023, indicating a renewed focus on growth. Management has emphasized a focus on profitable growth, which includes a disciplined approach to sales and marketing investments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, PayPal's operating margin was 17%, consistent with the prior year. Net income was $4.1 billion on $31.8 billion in revenue, for a net profit margin of approximately 13%. These margins are healthy, but have faced pressure from a changing product mix (e.g., growth of lower-margin Braintree services) and competition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving the cost structure and operating efficiency. In the first quarter of 2024, the company initiated a global workforce reduction intended to streamline operations and focus resources on core priorities. This action is expected to result in annualized cost savings of approximately $575 million. The company is also focused on driving growth in higher-margin branded checkout and value-added services.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, PayPal employed approximately 24,400 people globally. The company emphasizes a strong culture and offers comprehensive benefits. However, the company has undergone significant workforce reductions in 2023 and 2024, which can negatively impact morale and relations. Without more direct evidence of employee satisfaction or turnover rates, it is difficult to definitively assess this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has experienced some recent executive turnover, including a new CEO, Alex Chriss, who started in September 2023. This has been followed by other leadership changes. While management changes can be disruptive, they can also bring fresh perspectives. The current executive team's ability to work together effectively and execute on the company's strategy will be a key factor to watch.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has a new leadership team in place under CEO Alex Chriss, with experienced executives leading key segments like Consumer, Small Business, and Large Enterprise. The company's ability to execute on its strategic priorities will depend on the effectiveness of this new team. While the new team appears capable on paper, their ability to drive a turnaround and foster innovation has yet to be proven over the long term.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, publicly traded financial technology company, PayPal is subject to rigorous accounting standards and internal controls. The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from management on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, which concluded that such controls were effective as of December 31, 2024. The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, has also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the payments industry is the two-sided network effect. PayPal's large base of 434 million active accounts creates a powerful network that attracts both consumers and merchants. The company's trusted brand and reputation for security are also significant assets in an industry where trust is paramount. However, competition is fierce, with rivals like Apple, Google, and major banks all vying for market share.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The new management team has emphasized a focus on "profitable growth" and is making investments in product innovation and marketing to reinvigorate the business. While the company is also focused on cost discipline, the willingness to invest in growth initiatives suggests a long-range perspective. The Q2 2025 earnings call reiterated this focus on balancing growth and profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PYPL/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PYPL/transcripts/) (July 29, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal has a strong balance sheet with $13.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments as of December 31, 2024. The company generates significant cash flow from operations ($7.5 billion in 2024). Furthermore, the company has an active stock repurchase program, having bought back $6.0 billion of its stock in 2024. This indicates that dilution from equity financing is not a significant risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391725000019/pypl-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company regularly holds earnings calls and investor day presentations where it discusses its performance and strategy. Management has been open about the challenges the company has faced, including increased competition and the need to innovate. The transcripts of these events show a willingness to address difficult questions from analysts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PYPL/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PYPL/transcripts/) (July 29, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PayPal is subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings, which is not uncommon for a company of its size in the financial services industry. The company's 10-K and 10-Q filings disclose these matters. There are no indications of significant integrity issues with the current management team.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
PayPal scores well on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market opportunity, financial strength, and commitment to long-term growth. The company operates in a large and growing market, has a strong balance sheet, and is actively investing in new products and services. However, there are some areas of concern. The recent management turnover and workforce reductions raise questions about stability and employee morale. The effectiveness of the company's R&D efforts is also a key variable to watch. The score could improve significantly in the next 12-24 months if the new leadership team can demonstrate a clear and successful innovation roadmap that translates into market share gains and improved profitability. A key indicator of this would be an acceleration in branded checkout volume and an increase in user engagement metrics. Conversely, a failure to innovate and effectively compete could lead to a further decline in the company's growth prospects and a lower score.

fisher score is 12 / 15
