### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** McDonald's has a $15.0 billion share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors, effective January 1, 2025, with no specified expiration date. As of June 30, 2025, the company had repurchased 3.2 million shares for $953 million.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, leads to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing throughout 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $2.0 billion in shares in the remainder of 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $4.0 billion in shares in the remainder of 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $6.0 billion in shares in the remainder of 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). A significant reduction in share count could lead to a modest increase in the stock price, though this is a recurring and often priced-in catalyst.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a long history of returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong free cash flow generation.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q filings.
    *   Free cash flow generation.
    *   Announcements of any new or expanded repurchase programs.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business could reduce cash available for buybacks.
    *   Management could prioritize debt reduction or acquisitions over share repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of share repurchases in upcoming quarterly reports.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Restaurant Unit Expansion

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** McDonald's plans to open approximately 2,200 new restaurants globally in 2025, contributing to slightly over 4% new unit growth.
*   **Mechanism:** New restaurant openings directly contribute to revenue and earnings growth. This top-line growth can lead to a higher stock price through increased profitability and a positive outlook for future expansion.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing throughout 2025.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 1,800 net new restaurants opened in 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 2,000 net new restaurants opened in 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** 2,200 net new restaurants opened in 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (3-7%). New unit growth is a key driver for a mature company like McDonald's, and successful execution of expansion plans can boost investor confidence.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a well-established development pipeline and a strong track record of opening new restaurants.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Availability of suitable real estate locations.
    *   Ability to attract and retain qualified franchisees.
    *   Favorable economic conditions in target markets.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on new restaurant openings in Form 10-Q filings.
    *   Systemwide sales growth.
    *   Company guidance on future restaurant development.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Delays in construction or permitting.
    *   Economic downturns in key expansion markets.
    *   Cannibalization of sales from existing restaurants.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of new restaurant openings and their impact on systemwide sales growth.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** "Best Burger" Initiative

*   **Type:** Product

*   **Mechanism:** Improved product quality can lead to increased customer satisfaction, repeat business, and market share gains. This can drive comparable sales growth, a key metric for restaurant stocks, and ultimately lead to higher earnings and a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** 2025-2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 0.5% increase in comparable sales growth.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 1.0% increase in comparable sales growth.
    *   **High Scenario:** 1.5% increase in comparable sales growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (4-8%). A successful product quality enhancement across the company's core burger offerings could drive meaningful comparable sales growth and improve brand perception.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has been testing and rolling out these changes in various markets, suggesting a high level of commitment to the initiative.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Consistent execution of the new operational procedures across all restaurants.
    *   Positive customer reception to the changes.

    *   Comparable sales growth in markets where "Best Burger" has been implemented.
    *   Customer satisfaction and brand perception surveys.
    *   Company updates on the rollout progress in quarterly reports and investor calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Execution challenges leading to inconsistent product quality.
    *   Increased operational complexity and costs for franchisees.
    *   The changes not being significant enough to drive a noticeable increase in customer traffic.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor comparable sales growth and management commentary on the "Best Burger" initiative in the coming quarters.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Restaurant Unit Expansion**

*   **Formula:** Estimated Revenue Increase = (Number of Net New Restaurants \* Average Revenue per Restaurant)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Base case: 2,000 net new restaurants.
    *   Average revenue per restaurant: $3.5 million (Inference based on total systemwide sales and number of restaurants).
*   **Calculation:**
    *   2,000 \* $3,500,000 = $7,000,000,000 in additional systemwide sales.
*   **Valuation Impact:**
    *   A $7 billion increase in systemwide sales would translate to a significant increase in royalty and rental income for McDonald's, driving earnings growth and potentially justifying a higher valuation.

**2. "Best Burger" Initiative**

*   **Formula:** Estimated Revenue Increase = (Total Systemwide Sales \* % Increase in Comparable Sales)
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Base case: 1.0% increase in comparable sales.
    *   2024 Systemwide Sales: $130.7 billion.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   $130,700,000,000 \* 0.01 = $1,307,000,000 in additional systemwide sales.
*   **Valuation Impact:**
    *   A 1% increase in comparable sales would demonstrate the company's ability to drive organic growth, which is highly valued by investors and would likely lead to a higher P/E multiple and stock price.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for McDonald's are generally positive but modest in their potential impact. The share repurchase program and restaurant unit expansion provide a solid foundation for continued growth and shareholder returns. However, these are largely expected by the market and may not drive significant outperformance on their own. The short-term market signal is neutral to slightly positive, with the company's execution of its expansion plans being the key factor to watch.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Global Economic Downturn:** A significant global recession could lead to a sharp decline in consumer spending, negatively impacting sales and profitability across all of McDonald's markets.
2.  **Major Food Safety Incident:** A widespread food safety issue could severely damage the company's brand and reputation, leading to a loss of customer trust and a significant decline in sales.
3.  **Intensified Competition:** Increased competition from other fast-food chains and fast-casual restaurants could erode McDonald's market share and put pressure on pricing and margins.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on the analysis, McDonald's presents a stable investment with a handful of near-term catalysts that are likely to support the stock price. The most significant near-term catalyst is the company's aggressive restaurant unit expansion, which is expected to drive top-line growth. The "Best Burger" initiative offers longer-term potential for organic growth, but its impact remains to be seen. The expected upside is in the low single digits, with the most important indicator to monitor being the pace of new restaurant openings and their contribution to systemwide sales growth.
