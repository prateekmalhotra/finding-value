CVS Health Corporation, August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health operates in the large and growing U.S. healthcare sector. The company's integrated model, spanning pharmacy services, retail, and health insurance, positions it to benefit from long-term trends such as an aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases. The company's Health Services segment, which includes its pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), and Health Care Benefits segment, are positioned to capture a larger share of the healthcare market. In their Q2 2025 earnings call on August 7, 2025, CEO Karen S. Lynch highlighted the company's focus on expanding its value-based care models and digital health services to meet evolving consumer needs.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health has demonstrated a commitment to evolving its business model through acquisitions and internal development. The recent acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health are aimed at expanding its presence in primary care and at-home health services. The company is also investing in technology to enhance its digital offerings and improve patient outcomes. In their 2024 Annual Report, the company stated their focus on leveraging technology to create a superior, connected health experience.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a healthcare services company, CVS Health's R&D is not comparable to that of a pharmaceutical or technology company. The company's investments are primarily focused on technology and service development rather than traditional R&D. The company does not disclose a specific R&D expense, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these efforts in relation to its size. While the company is investing in technology and digital initiatives, the direct financial returns on these investments are not yet clear.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's large and established retail footprint, combined with its PBM and health insurance businesses, gives it a significant sales and distribution network. The company's ability to attract and retain customers in its various segments is a testament to the strength of its sales and marketing efforts. The company's integrated offerings create cross-selling opportunities that are difficult for competitors to replicate. In the second quarter of 2025, CVS reported an increase in same-store sales and pharmacy prescription volume.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000024/cvs-20250630.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's profit margins have been under pressure in recent years due to reimbursement pressure in the pharmacy business and rising costs in its health insurance segment. In the second quarter of 2025, the company's operating margin was 3.5%, which is relatively low. While the company is taking steps to improve profitability, its margins are not currently at a level that would be considered "worthwhile" in the context of Fisher's analysis.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000024/cvs-20250630.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health is implementing a number of initiatives to improve its profit margins. These include cost-cutting measures, such as store closures and workforce reductions. The company is also focused on growing its higher-margin businesses, such as specialty pharmacy and value-based care. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, management detailed a multi-year plan to improve margins through operational efficiencies and portfolio optimization.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health has faced challenges with labor relations in recent years. The company has been the subject of strikes and protests by its pharmacists and other employees over working conditions and staffing levels. While the company has stated that it is committed to addressing these concerns, the ongoing labor disputes suggest that its personnel relations are not "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health has a relatively stable and experienced executive team. Karen S. Lynch has served as CEO since 2021, and the company has a clear succession plan in place. The company's board of directors is composed of a diverse group of individuals with relevant experience. There have been no public reports of significant infighting or disagreements among the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's management team includes experienced executives with deep knowledge of the healthcare industry. The company's segment leaders have been with the company for many years and have a proven track record of success. The company's acquisition of Signify Health and Oak Street Health has also brought in new talent with expertise in value-based care.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's financial reporting and accounting controls appear to be robust.

The company's auditor, Ernst & Young, has not raised any concerns about its accounting practices.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000007/cvs-20241231.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's integrated business model is a key competitive advantage. The company's ability to combine a retail pharmacy, a PBM, and a health insurance business allows it to provide a more coordinated and cost-effective healthcare experience. This vertical integration creates a significant barrier to entry for potential competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's recent acquisitions and investments in its value-based care strategy suggest that the company is focused on long-term growth. While these investments have put pressure on near-term earnings, they have the potential to create significant value for shareholders over the long run. Management has communicated a clear vision for the company's future and is willing to make short-term sacrifices to achieve its long-term goals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations. The company has a manageable amount of debt and has been returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The company's financial position is strong enough to fund its growth initiatives without the need for significant equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/64803/000006480325000024/cvs-20250630.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health's management team is generally transparent with investors. The company provides detailed financial guidance and regularly communicates its strategic priorities. When the company has faced challenges, such as the recent pressures on its profit margins, management has been upfront about the issues and has outlined its plans to address them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CVS/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CVS Health has been involved in a number of legal and regulatory issues over the years. The company has paid significant fines and settlements related to allegations of improper billing practices and other violations. While the company has taken steps to improve its compliance and ethics programs, its track record in this area is not unblemished.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**Synthesis:**
CVS Health scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and financial strength. The company's integrated business model provides a significant competitive advantage, and its management team is experienced and has a clear vision for the future. However, the company faces challenges with its profit margins and labor relations. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful integration of its recent acquisitions and a demonstrated improvement in its profit margins. A resolution of its labor disputes and a clean bill of health from a legal and regulatory perspective would also be necessary to turn the "No" answers to "Yes."

fisher score is 11 / 15
