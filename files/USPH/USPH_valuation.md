**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of $84.11, the market is pricing in the following assumptions:

*   **5-Year Revenue Growth Rate (CAGR):** Approximately **10.5%**

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

**C) Formulate Realistic Assumptions (5 Years)**

The following assumptions have been revised from "conservative" to "realistic," reflecting a balanced view of the company's prospects.

*   **Revenue Growth:** A 5-year CAGR of **8%**, tapering from 10% in Year 1 to 6% in Year 5. This rate remains a solid base case, balancing strong industry tailwinds and acquisition potential with the law of large numbers and a maturing market.
*   **Operating Margin:** Maintained at **10.2%**. This is slightly below the current TTM level but revised upwards from the initial conservative estimate. It realistically accounts for reimbursement pressures while giving credit to potential operating leverage and efficiency gains as the company scales.
*   **Tax Rate:** **25.0%**, in line with the historical average.
*   **D&A, SBC, Capex, and Working Capital:** These items are now projected as a percentage of revenue to create a more dynamic and realistic model, rather than using fixed historical averages.
    *   **Depreciation & Amortization:** 3.0% of Revenue
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** 1.1% of Revenue
    *   **Capital Expenditures:** 1.5% of Revenue
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** 3.5% of the change in Revenue

*   **Diluted Share Count:** A net **0.5% annual reduction** in shares outstanding, reflecting a modest level of buybacks offset by dilution from stock-based compensation.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| Year | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FCFF (Millions USD)** | **$61.5** | **$66.5** | **$71.4** | **$76.1** | **$80.5** |

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

The WACC calculation is sound, with a minor clarification on the cost of debt.

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.25% (10-Year Treasury Yield, August 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 5.0%
    *   Beta: 0.85 (Sourced from public financial data providers)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 0.85 \* 5.0% = 8.5%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-Tax Cost of Debt: 6.0% (Based on company's credit profile and rates)
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 6.0% \* (1 - 25%) = 4.5%
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: $1,270 Million
    *   Market Value of Debt: $159.5 Million
    *   **WACC = (1270 / 1429.5) \* 8.5% + (159.5 / 1429.5) \* 4.5% = 8.0%**

**F) Terminal Value**

The terminal value calculation has been revised to use the **Exit Multiple Method** as the primary approach, which is more common for valuing established companies and is less sensitive to small changes in long-term growth and WACC assumptions.

*   **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA: $139.1 Million (Calculated as Year 5 EBIT of $107.5M + Year 5 D&A of $31.6M)
    *   Exit Multiple: **12.0x EV/EBITDA**. This multiple is in line with the historical valuation range for mature, high-quality healthcare service providers and reflects a stable, cash-generative business at the end of the forecast period.
    *   **Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA \* Exit Multiple = $139.1 Million \* 12.0 = $1,669.2 Million**
*   **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   A terminal value of $1,669.2 Million implies a perpetual growth rate (g) of **3.3%**.
    *   *Implied g = (WACC \* TV - Final Year FCFF) / (TV + Final Year FCFF) = (8.0% \* 1669.2 - 80.5) / (1669.2 + 80.5) = 3.3%*. This is a reasonable long-term growth rate, higher than inflation but below the long-term nominal GDP growth, confirming the 12.0x multiple is not overly aggressive.

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: $292.1 Million
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $1,136.0 Million
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $1,428.1 Million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Enterprise Value - Net Debt (Total Debt - Cash)
    *   **Equity Value = $1,428.1 Million - ($159.5 Million - $34.1 Million) = $1,302.7 Million**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Equity Value / Projected Year 5 Diluted Shares
    *   **$1,302.7 Million / 14.7 Million Shares = $88.62 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$88.62**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$72.00** (assumes lower growth of 6% and margin compression to 9.5%)
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$105.00** (assumes higher growth of 10% and margin expansion to 10.8%)
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Base-Case):** **$62.03**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Reimbursement Risk:** Changes in Medicare and private payor reimbursement rates could negatively impact revenue and margins.
2.  **Acquisition Integration Risk:** Future growth is dependent on successfully identifying and integrating acquisitions, which carries inherent risks.
3.  **Competition:** The physical therapy market is highly fragmented and competitive, which could pressure pricing and market share.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** The healthcare industry is subject to extensive regulation, and changes in laws or regulations could adversely affect the business.
5.  **Labor Market:** The ability to attract and retain qualified physical therapists is crucial to operations and growth.

final answer is 88.62 $
