### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** On Holding has a weak network effect based on brand community rather than a product or platform lock-in. While a growing user base enhances brand desirability and creates a sense of community among athletes and lifestyle users, the marginal utility for a new customer is minimal and does not prevent them from choosing a competing product. The effect is more akin to a fashion trend than a true, defensible network.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's strategy focuses on "premium positioning and strategic partnerships" to heighten "brand awareness," which points to a brand-driven community rather than a user-to-user network. (Earnings Call Summary | On Holding(ONON.US) Q1 2025 Earnings Conference - Moomoo, June 3, 2025).
*   The company mission is to "ignite the human spirit through movement," which is an individual-centric goal, not a network-based one. (On - On Reports First Quarter 2025 Results - Investors, May 13, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for customers are effectively zero, which is typical for the consumer footwear and apparel industry. There is no contractual, technical, or behavioral lock-in that would create a significant barrier for a customer to purchase a product from a competitor like Nike, Hoka, or Adidas on their next purchase. Brand loyalty exists but is a soft factor, not a hard switching cost.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is built on individual, transactional sales through Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) and wholesale channels, with no evidence of subscription models or long-term contracts for typical consumers. (On Holding AG (ONON) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha, May 13, 2025).
*   The 20-F annual report highlights the strength of the "premium brand" as a key dependency, implicitly acknowledging that customer choice is fluid and based on brand perception. (On Holding AG (Form: 20-F, Received: 03/21/2023 06:55:04) - EDGAR Online, March 21, 2023).
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** On does not demonstrate a structural cost advantage; in fact, its high gross margins suggest a price premium strategy, not cost leadership. The company relies on third-party manufacturers, similar to peers, and is exposed to supply chain volatility and tariffs. While scale is growing, there is no evidence of proprietary, low-cost processes or inputs that give it a durable cost edge over competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   Gross profit margin increased to 59.9% in Q1 2025, a level that reflects premium pricing rather than a low-cost structure. (On Holding AG (ONON) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha, May 13, 2025).
*   The company acknowledges risks from "global trade policy shifts and potential incremental tariffs" and "volatile foreign exchange rates," indicating exposure to common industry-wide cost pressures. (Earnings Call Summary | On Holding(ONON.US) Q1 2025 Earnings Conference - Moomoo, June 3, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** This is On's strongest dimension. The company has a powerful, rapidly growing premium brand that allows for premium pricing, and this brand is built upon patented technology like CloudTec®. This combination of a strong, well-marketed brand identity and a portfolio of proprietary technology patents creates a significant, though not insurmountable, competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The business "depends on the strength of our premium brand," which allows the company to execute its premium pricing strategy. (On Holding AG (Form: 20-F, Received: 03/21/2023 06:55:04) - EDGAR Online, March 21, 2023).
*   The company's foundation is its patented "CloudTec® technology," a cushioning system that serves as a key product differentiator and is core to its marketing. (ONON Investor Relations - On Holding AG - Alpha Spread, August 22, 2025).
*   The company continues to innovate with new technologies like "LightSpray™" to build on its IP portfolio. (On - On Reports First Quarter 2025 Results - Investors, May 13, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** On has rapidly built a global, multi-channel distribution network spanning wholesale partners and a growing direct-to-consumer (DTC) footprint. While not as vast as incumbent giants, its scale in the premium performance segment is significant and growing efficiently. The hybrid model allows it to reach a broad customer base while controlling its brand image and capturing higher margins through DTC.
**Evidence:**
*   The company operates a global distribution model with strong growth in its DTC channel, which reached 38.1% of net sales in Q1 2025. (On Holding AG (ONON) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha, May 13, 2025).
*   The company is expanding its physical retail presence with new flagship stores, such as in Chengdu, China, to complement its wholesale and online channels. (Earnings Call Summary | On Holding(ONON.US) Q1 2025 Earnings Conference - Moomoo, June 3, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** The growing DTC channel provides On with valuable first-party data on customer preferences, purchasing behavior, and product performance. This creates a feedback loop for product development and marketing that wholesale-dependent brands lack. However, the scale and sophistication of this data asset are likely still nascent compared to larger, more established competitors with decades of consumer data.
**Evidence:**
*   The DTC channel grew 45.3% year-over-year in Q1 2025, providing a rapidly expanding source of direct consumer data. (On Holding AG (ONON) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha, May 13, 2025).
*   The company's focus on DTC is a strategic priority, as it "is successfully increasing sales and profitability," which includes leveraging the data from these direct relationships. (Earnings Call Summary | On Holding(ONON.US) Q1 2025 Earnings Conference - Moomoo, June 3, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** On Holding does not operate an ecosystem or platform model. It does not have a marketplace for third-party developers or complementary product sellers. Its business is a traditional, vertically-integrated model of designing, marketing, and selling its own branded products.
**Evidence:**
*   Company filings and presentations describe a business model focused on the sale of its own footwear, apparel, and accessories, with no mention of a third-party ecosystem. (On Holding AG (Form: 20-F, Received: 03/21/2023 06:55:04) - EDGAR Online, March 21, 2023).
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The global sportswear market has no significant regulatory barriers to entry that would prevent competition. On Holding does not benefit from any exclusive licenses, government contracts, or other legal barriers that would protect its market position. It is subject to standard international trade and customs regulations.
**Evidence:**
*   Risk factors cited by the company relate to common business risks like brand perception and supply chain, not the loss of a specific, material license or regulatory approval. (On Holding AG (Form: 20-F, Received: 03/21/2023 06:55:04) - EDGAR Online, March 21, 2023).
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** On's capital intensity is relatively low due to its asset-light model of outsourcing manufacturing. While it invests in R&D facilities ("On Labs") and flagship stores, it does not require the massive capital expenditures for production plants that would deter new entrants. This asset-light approach, common in the industry, lowers barriers to entry.
**Evidence:**
*   Capital expenditures were CHF 12.1 million in Q1 2025, representing a very low 1.7% of net sales, demonstrating the asset-light model. (On Holding AG (ONON) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha, May 13, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** As a primarily transactional consumer business, On has very low revenue visibility from long-term contracts. Revenue is generated from at-will purchases by consumers and periodic orders from wholesale partners. There is no significant backlog or recurring revenue model to provide long-term predictability.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's revenue is composed of sales through its DTC and wholesale channels, which are transactional by nature. (On Holding AG (ONON) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript | Seeking Alpha, May 13, 2025).
*   The company provides full-year guidance based on "ongoing brand strength" and "visibility on the order book," but this reflects short-term wholesale orders, not long-term contracts. (On - On Reports First Quarter 2025 Results - Investors, May 13, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (1*0.18) + (0*0.15) + (2*0.15) + (4*0.12) + (3*0.10) + (2*0.10) + (0*0.08) + (0*0.06) + (1*0.04) + (1*0.02) = 0.18 + 0.0 + 0.30 + 0.48 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.04 + 0.02 = 1.52
*   The prompt requested a score out of 100, so the weighted score is 15.2. My apologies, I will score correctly.
*   **Corrected Weighted Score Calculation**: (1*18) + (0*15) + (2*15) + (4*12) + (3*10) + (2*10) + (0*8) + (0*6) + (1*4) + (1*2) = 18 + 0 + 30 + 48 + 30 + 20 + 0 + 0 + 4 + 2 = 152. This is not possible, the weightings are percentages.
*   Let's redo the calculation correctly: (1 * 0.18) + (0 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (0 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.0 + 0.30 + 0.48 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.0 + 0.0 + 0.04 + 0.02 = 1.52. The total score is a weighted average out of 5.
*   To get a score out of 100, we multiply the scores by 20: ((1*20)*0.18) + ((0*20)*0.15) + ((2*20)*0.15) + ((4*20)*0.12) + ((3*20)*0.10) + ((2*20)*0.10) + ((0*20)*0.08) + ((0*20)*0.06) + ((1*20)*0.04) + ((1*20)*0.02) = 3.6 + 0 + 6.0 + 9.6 + 6.0 + 4.0 + 0 + 0 + 0.8 + 0.4 = 30.4.
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 30.4 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   The weighted score of 30.4 falls into the range of 30 ≤ Weighted < 50, which maps to a final moat rating of 2.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The moat's durability is estimated at approximately 7–10 years. This is primarily linked to the strength of its intangible assets. The brand's current premium perception is strong but susceptible to shifts in consumer tastes, a cycle that often plays out over 5-10 years in fashion and apparel. Furthermore, while the company's core CloudTec® technology is protected by patents, these patents have a finite life and competitors will continue to engineer rival cushioning systems, likely narrowing the perceived technological gap over the next decade.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Brand Fatigue:** The premium, high-growth "fad" aspect of the brand cools, and it struggles to transition into a mature, enduring staple like its larger competitors.
2.  **Technological Invalidation:** A competitor launches a new footwear technology that is demonstrably superior in performance or comfort, making CloudTec® obsolete and eroding On's primary product differentiator.
3.  **Margin Compression:** Increased competition and rising input costs from supply chain pressures force On to reduce its premium pricing, which erodes its high gross margins and profitability, harming its ability to reinvest in marketing and R&D. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Summary, June 3, 2025).

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Gross Profit Margin:** A decline would indicate eroding pricing power and brand premium.
*   **DTC Channel % of Net Sales:** A stall or decline could signal weakening brand connection and loss of valuable consumer data.
*   **Marketing & Selling Expenses as % of Sales:** A sustained increase could mean growth is becoming less efficient and more expensive to acquire.
*   **Inventory Growth vs. Sales Growth:** Inventory growing faster than sales can be a lead indicator of waning demand.
*   **Geographic Growth Rates:** Monitor for slowing momentum in key expansion markets like APAC and the Americas.
*   **New Patent Filings:** Track the pace of innovation and IP generation.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
On Holding's current competitive advantage is a narrow moat, earning a 2/5 rating. This advantage is overwhelmingly dependent on the dual intangible assets of its trendy, premium brand and its patented CloudTec® technology. While potent, this moat lacks the structural reinforcements of high switching costs, network effects, or a durable cost advantage. The company's high margins are a reflection of pricing power, not cost efficiency. For the rating to improve, On would need to demonstrate that its brand can endure beyond the current fashion cycle and that its data advantage from the DTC channel can translate into a more meaningful, hard-to-replicate asset.

moat rating is 2 / 5
