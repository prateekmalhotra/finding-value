### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Continued New Restaurant Openings
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CAVA has a stated goal of opening new restaurants at a rate of at least 15% annually. In fiscal 2024, the company opened 58 net new restaurants. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** New restaurant openings directly increase revenue and, if profitable, contribute to bottom-line growth. This expansion signals market demand and a scalable business model, which can lead to multiple expansion.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with new openings announced quarterly. (10-Q, Aug 12, 2025)
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 15% unit growth in fiscal 2025 (approximately 55 new restaurants). Assuming AUV of $2.865 million, this would add ~$157 million in annualized revenue. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
    *   **Base Scenario:** 17% unit growth in fiscal 2025 (approximately 62 new restaurants). Assuming AUV of $2.865 million, this would add ~$177 million in annualized revenue. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
    *   **High Scenario:** 20% unit growth in fiscal 2025 (approximately 73 new restaurants). Assuming AUV of $2.865 million, this would add ~$209 million in annualized revenue. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+10-20%), based on the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a consistent track record of meeting or exceeding its new opening targets. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful site selection, construction, and staffing of new locations.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly announcements of new restaurant openings, pre-opening costs in financial statements.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Sustained Same-Restaurant Sales Growth
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CAVA has demonstrated strong same-restaurant sales growth, with a 13.4% increase in fiscal 2024. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025) This growth is driven by a combination of increased guest traffic and higher menu prices/product mix.
*   **Mechanism:** Strong same-restaurant sales growth indicates healthy demand at existing locations and pricing power, leading to higher profitability and improved investor sentiment.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, reported quarterly. (10-Q, Aug 12, 2025)
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 5% same-restaurant sales growth in fiscal 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 8% same-restaurant sales growth in fiscal 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** 12% same-restaurant sales growth in fiscal 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+10-20%). Continued strong growth would signal a durable competitive advantage.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. While a high level of growth is not guaranteed to continue, the brand's momentum is strong.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued brand appeal, successful marketing, and a stable macroeconomic environment.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly same-restaurant sales growth figures, guest traffic data.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Increased competition, negative changes in consumer preferences, and economic downturns.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a key metric for gauging the underlying health of the business.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Margin Expansion through Operational Efficiencies
*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CAVA has been focused on improving restaurant-level profitability, with the CAVA Restaurant-Level Profit Margin increasing to 25.0% in fiscal 2024 from 24.8% in fiscal 2023. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** Higher margins translate directly to higher earnings, which can drive a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with progress reflected in quarterly earnings reports. (10-Q, Aug 12, 2025)
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Restaurant-level profit margin remains flat at 25.0%. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
    *   **Base Scenario:** Restaurant-level profit margin expands by 50 basis points to 25.5%. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
    *   **High Scenario:** Restaurant-level profit margin expands by 100 basis points to 26.0%. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)

*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Favorable commodity pricing, effective labor management, and successful implementation of cost-saving initiatives.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Restaurant-level profit margin, food, beverage, and packaging costs as a percentage of revenue, and labor costs as a percentage of revenue.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Inflationary pressures on food and labor costs, and operational challenges in new restaurants.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Margin trends are an important indicator of management's operational effectiveness.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Successful Expansion into New Geographic Markets
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** CAVA is in the early stages of a national expansion, with a goal of reaching over 1,000 restaurants by 2032. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025) This will require successful entry into new geographic markets where the brand has less recognition.
*   **Mechanism:** Successful expansion into new markets will dramatically increase the company's total addressable market and revenue potential, leading to a significant increase in the company's valuation.
*   **Timing:** 12-60 months and beyond. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Average of 70 new restaurants per year for the next 5 years, reaching a total of ~717 restaurants.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Average of 85 new restaurants per year for the next 5 years, reaching a total of ~792 restaurants.
    *   **High Scenario:** Average of 100 new restaurants per year for the next 5 years, reaching a total of ~867 restaurants.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). Achieving this level of growth would transform the company's scale and market position.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. Execution of a long-term, large-scale expansion is challenging and subject to numerous risks.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful brand adoption in new markets, a robust real estate pipeline, and the ability to maintain operational consistency at scale.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** New restaurant openings in new vs. existing markets, AUVs in new markets, and regional sales growth.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Failure to gain traction in new markets, a decline in unit economics, and increased competition.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. For long-term investors, this is the primary thesis for owning the stock.

**2. Catalyst Title:** International Expansion
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** While not explicitly stated as a near-term goal, the CAVA concept has the potential for international appeal. Successful expansion beyond the U.S. could be a major long-term growth driver.
*   **Mechanism:** International expansion would open up a new, and potentially very large, addressable market, leading to a step-change in the company's growth trajectory.
*   **Timing:** 36-60 months and beyond.
*   **Quantification:** This is highly speculative and difficult to quantify at this stage.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%).
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 20%. This is a speculative catalyst with no current stated plans from the company.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Success in the U.S. market, identification of suitable international partners, and adaptation of the concept to local tastes.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Any mention of international plans in company communications.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Execution challenges, cultural differences, and the complexities of international supply chains.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Avoid for now. This is a long-term possibility, not an actionable catalyst at this time.
