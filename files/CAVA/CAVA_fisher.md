The company's vertically integrated production of its signature dips and spreads allows for greater quality control and consistency. CAVA's data-driven real estate selection process and flexible restaurant formats, including drive-thru pickup lanes, give it an edge in securing desirable locations.

The company is investing heavily in new restaurants, technology, and its manufacturing capabilities to support this growth.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of July 13, 2025, CAVA had $290.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding debt. The company has been generating positive cash flow from operations, which was $98.9 million for the twenty-eight weeks ended July 13, 2025. This strong financial position should be sufficient to fund the company's near-term expansion plans without the need for dilutive equity financing. While the company may choose to raise capital for strategic opportunities, it is not reliant on equity financing for its organic growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CAVA's management team provides detailed information and answers questions from analysts during its quarterly earnings calls. They have been transparent about challenges, such as inflationary pressures and supply chain issues, and have discussed the steps they are taking to address them.

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of any legal or regulatory issues that would question the integrity of CAVA's management team. The company has a code of business conduct and ethics, and its financial reporting appears to be transparent and straightforward. The company settled a few lawsuits related to PFAS in its packaging in 2024, but this does not appear to be a reflection of a lack of integrity on the part of management.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis:** CAVA scores very highly on Fisher's 15-point checklist, with strong positives in its growth potential, brand strength, profitability, and management team. The company is well-positioned in the fast-growing Mediterranean fast-casual segment and has a clear plan for national expansion. The biggest variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its continued restaurant expansion into new markets, its ability to maintain strong same-restaurant sales growth in the face of increasing competition, and its ability to manage inflationary pressures without sacrificing margins or customer traffic. A significant slowdown in new unit growth or a sustained decline in same-restaurant sales would be the most likely factors to turn a "Yes" to a "No."

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
