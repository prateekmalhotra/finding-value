Company: Canadian National Railway Company (CNI)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Annual Report (Published February 4, 2025), Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (May 1, 2025), Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (July 22, 2025), and various news reports on labor negotiations.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a major North American railroad, CNI is fundamental to the continent's economy, transporting over 300 million tons of resources, manufactured products, and finished goods annually. The company's growth is directly linked to North American economic activity and trade, which provides a long-term demand runway. CNI's tri-coastal network serves resource-rich regions and uniquely bypasses Chicago congestion, offering a durable competitive advantage for bulk commodities, intermodal transport, and new opportunities like direct Canada-to-Mexico routes. Management remains optimistic about volume growth in the second half of the year and maintains guidance for low single-digit RTM growth despite some market softness.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CNI's development is focused on network efficiency, capacity expansion, and technology adoption rather than traditional "product" R&D. The company's 2024 Annual Report details a multi-billion dollar capital program for track and railway infrastructure maintenance and expansion. The Q1 2025 earnings call highlighted a focus on modernizing the locomotive fleet and expanding network capacity. This commitment to investing in the core network and technology is designed to handle future growth and improve service, thereby increasing long-term sales potential.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Railroads do not have R&D departments in the way a technology or pharmaceutical company does; capital investment in technology and network improvements is the closest equivalent. CNI's efforts are focused on operational efficiency and safety through technology, such as automated inspection portals and data analytics. While these are effective for optimizing the existing business model, it doesn't align with Fisher's concept of developing new product lines. There are no disclosed metrics to compare CNI's "R&D" spending or output effectiveness against its peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales efforts are centered on a "customer-centric" approach and leveraging its network advantages. The Q2 2025 earnings call highlighted strong performance in bulk volumes, particularly agriculture, reflecting an advantaged network and strong market share. Management consistently notes that their pricing remains ahead of rail cost inflation, indicating a disciplined and effective commercial strategy. The focus on developing new services, such as the Falcon service for Canada-Mexico trade, further demonstrates a proactive sales approach.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, CNI consistently demonstrates strong profitability. In its Q2 2025 results, the company delivered an operating ratio of 61.7%, a 50 basis point improvement over the prior year's adjusted figure. (A lower operating ratio is better in the railroad industry). This metric is a key indicator of efficiency and profitability. The company's ability to maintain pricing power ahead of inflation helps protect these margins.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively managing costs to protect margins in an uncertain demand environment. During Q2 2025, the operating team took "swift action to adjust the train package to our evolving volume mix," cutting 8% of mainline manifest train starts in response to a 7% decrease in merchandise workload. This demonstrates a focus on operational efficiency. The company also consistently pursues "pricing above rail inflation" to protect profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The evidence points to challenging, not outstanding, labor relations. In 2024 and early 2025, CNI was involved in intense negotiations with multiple unions. While a strike was averted with the IBEW in January 2025 and a tentative agreement was reached with Unifor in December 2024, the company faced a lockout and strike with the Teamsters Canada Rail Conference (TCRC). This dispute was ultimately sent to binding arbitration by the Canadian government, which imposed a new contract on April 7, 2025, an outcome the union described as "not the preferred outcome." These events indicate significant friction.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current executive team, led by CEO Tracy Robinson and CFO Ghislain Houle, appears stable and presents a unified message on earnings calls and investor presentations. There is no public evidence of significant friction or instability at the senior executive level. The leadership team is composed of seasoned executives with extensive experience in the transportation and logistics industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CNI's public disclosures name a full slate of executive and senior vice-presidents beyond the CEO and CFO, covering key functions like Operations, Technology, and Marketing. For instance, Dominique Malenfant serves as EVP and Chief Information and Technology Officer, and Derek Taylor is the Chief Field Operations Officer, who spoke directly to operational details on the Q1 2025 earnings call. This indicates a professional management structure with clear divisional leadership.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CNI provides detailed financial statements in its annual and quarterly reports, prepared under U.S. GAAP, with clear segment reporting. On earnings calls, executives demonstrate granular control and understanding of cost drivers, such as breaking down labor and benefits expense increases by FX impact and wage inflation. There is no recent history of material weaknesses, restatements, or auditor issues mentioned in the reviewed documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-transcript-canadian-national-railway-sees-q1-2025-eps-growth-3388142](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/earnings-call-transcript-canadian-national-railway-sees-q1-2025-eps-growth-3388142) (May 1, 2025), [https://www.railwayage.com/investor/a-leading-north-american-transportation-and-supply-chain-company/](https://www.railwayage.com/investor/a-leading-north-american-transportation-and-supply-chain-company/)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the railroad industry, the quality and reach of the physical network is the paramount competitive advantage. CNI's network is unique as it is the only one in North America connecting the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts. This "tri-coastal" access provides a significant, durable advantage in serving a diverse range of markets and trade flows. Furthermore, its route network bypasses the historically congested Chicago area, offering customers a more fluid and reliable supply chain option.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CNI balances near-term results with long-term investment. While the company is "tightly managing costs in this uncertain environment," it continues to execute a significant capital investment plan to maintain and improve its network for the long term. Management maintained full-year EPS growth guidance in Q1 2025 but softened expectations for RTM growth in Q2 2025 due to "ongoing uncertainty," showing a focus on current realities. The willingness to invest billions in capital programs annually points to a long-range view, even as they actively manage short-term profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow, which it uses for capital expenditures and shareholder returns. The Q1 2025 transcript notes an impressive Financial Health Score with strong returns on equity and invested capital. On July 22, 2025, the company declared a third-quarter dividend, demonstrating confidence in its cash position. There is no indication that CNI needs to or intends to issue equity to fund its growth; its capital program is funded through operating cash flow.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Tracy Robinson openly acknowledged the negative impact of tariffs and a weaker industrial economy on merchandise and intermodal segments. They also directly addressed the reasons for softening their full-year guidance, citing "ongoing uncertainty." This willingness to discuss challenges and adjust outlook based on a changing environment, rather than just highlighting the positive bulk business, is a strong indicator of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no indications from the reviewed sources of significant governance red flags, scandals, or legal issues concerning management's integrity. The company files regular reports with securities regulators in Canada and the United States and operates with a professional board and executive team. The 2024 Annual Report outlines the key risks and forward-looking statements in a standard and transparent manner.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Canadian National Railway scores well on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong, defensible market position, consistent profitability, and shareholder-friendly financial management. The company's primary strengths are its unique tri-coastal network, which provides a durable competitive moat, and its disciplined operational and financial management, leading to strong margins and returns on capital. The two main areas of weakness identified are its lack of a traditional R&D function as defined by Fisher and, more significantly, its strained labor relations, which have recently required government intervention. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables: the macroeconomic environment impacting freight volumes and the outcome of ongoing and future labor negotiations. A prolonged period of labor stability without disruptive contract renewals would be the most significant evidence to flip the "No" on Point 7 to a "Yes."

fisher score is 13 / 15
