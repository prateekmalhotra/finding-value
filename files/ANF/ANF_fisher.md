Synthesis: Abercrombie & Fitch Co. scores well on the Fisher checklist, with the company's strong brand revitalization, impressive sales growth, and improving profitability being the key positives. The company's management team has a clear long-term vision and has been executing its strategies effectively. The two variables that are most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the sustainability of the current fashion trends that are driving the company's growth and the company's ability to continue to expand its international presence. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosures on employee satisfaction and turnover.
