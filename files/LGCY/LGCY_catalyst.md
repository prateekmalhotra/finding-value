**10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Regulatory crackdown on for-profit education:** The for-profit education sector is subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. New regulations could negatively impact the company's ability to operate and access federal student aid programs.
2.  **Severe economic recession:** A significant economic downturn could lead to a decrease in student enrollment as individuals choose to enter the workforce instead of pursuing further education.
3.  **Failed integration of CCMCC:** A failure to successfully integrate CCMCC could lead to higher-than-expected costs, a loss of students, and a negative impact on the company's financial performance.

**11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Legacy Education Inc. presents a compelling investment case based on its strong organic growth and the recent accretive acquisition of CCMCC. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for healthcare education.
