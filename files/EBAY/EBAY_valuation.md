### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the assumptions for growth and profitability that are embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$98.86** (Investing.com, August 21, 2025)

2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM):** The following table presents the Trailing Twelve Month financials for the period ended June 30, 2025.

| Financial Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $10,470 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 71.9% | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $2,168 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Net Income | $2,184 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $357 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $589 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures | ($503) | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($914) | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | ($251) | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $2,070 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $7,162 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 481 | (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the market price of $98.86, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model must yield the current Enterprise Value. Holding the TTM Operating Margin (EBIT Margin) of 20.7% constant, the model solves for the required revenue growth.

*   **Market-Implied Conclusion:** To justify the current stock price of $98.86, an investor must believe that eBay can grow its revenue at a **Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.5% over the next five years**, assuming a stable EBIT margin of 20.7%, a WACC of 9.3%, and a terminal growth rate of 2.5%.

---

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds a conservative, independent valuation based on historical performance and management guidance.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The market-implied growth rate of 7.5% is significantly higher than eBay's recent historical performance (2.75% TTM revenue growth). While management is focused on growth initiatives, a 7.5% CAGR appears optimistic. My base case will assume a more conservative growth trajectory that tapers over time.

7.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Assumption:** I will model revenue growth starting at **4.0% in Year 1, tapering down to 2.5% by Year 5.**
    *   **Justification:** This is more in line with the recent TTM growth of 2.75% and the FY2024 over FY2023 growth of 1.7%. It acknowledges management's focus on "Focus Categories" which are growing faster than the core business, but remains conservative given the intense competition and macroeconomic pressures on discretionary spending mentioned in the company's 10-K.

8.  **Margin Path:**
    *   **Assumption:** Operating (EBIT) margin will be held constant at the 3-year average of **22.1%.** (Calculated from 21.2% in FY23, 24.0% in FY22, and 21.9% in FY24).
    *   **Justification:** Management's discussion highlights a focus on driving operating margins, but also notes significant investments in technology and marketing. Using a 3-year average smooths out single-year fluctuations and provides a more stable, evidence-based margin assumption in the absence of explicit multi-year guidance.

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Assumption:** An effective tax rate of **19.0%.**
    *   **Justification:** This is the average effective tax rate over the last three full fiscal years (13.0% in 2024, 25.1% in 2023, and normalizing the negative rate in 2022 to a more typical 20%). This normalizes for significant one-off events related to gains/losses on equity investments.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** **4.5% of Revenue.** This is based on the 3-year average (4.4% in FY24, 4.5% in FY23, 4.6% in FY22).
    *   **Working Capital:** **1.5% of incremental revenue.** This reflects historical trends where working capital changes have generally been a small cash outflow as the company grows, consistent with the table below. (The previous "negative 1.5%" wording was ambiguous; this clarifies it as a cash outflow.)

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** **5.6% of Revenue**, consistent with the TTM level. For FCFF calculation, Stock-Based Compensation is treated as a non-cash expense and is added back.
    *   **Share Count:** A net **2.5% annual reduction in shares outstanding.** The company has a history of aggressive share repurchases, buying back $3.1 billion in FY2024. The Board authorized an additional $5.0 billion in repurchases in 2024, indicating a continued commitment. This assumption models the net effect of buybacks offsetting dilution from SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Formula & Calculation:** Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is calculated as:
    `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A + SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $10,889 | $11,260 | $11,598 | $11,917 | $12,215 |
| EBIT (22.1% margin) | $2,406 | $2,488 | $2,563 | $2,634 | $2,700 |
| NOPAT (EBIT \* (1-Tax)) | $1,949 | $2,015 | $2,076 | $2,133 | $2,187 |
| (+) D&A (3.4% of Rev) | $370 | $383 | $394 | $405 | $415 |
| (+) SBC (5.6% of Rev) | $609 | $629 | $648 | $666 | $682 |
| (-) Capex (4.5% of Rev) | ($490) | ($507) | ($522) | ($536) | ($550) |
| (-) âˆ† in WC (1.5% of incr. rev) | ($6) | ($5) | ($5) | ($4) | ($4) |
| **FCFF** | **$2,432** | **$2,515** | **$2,591** | **$2,664** | **$2,730** |

13. FCFF is used because it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** `Cost of Equity = RFR + Beta * ERP`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate (RFR):** **4.34%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%** (Standard market assumption).
    *   **Beta:** **1.26** (Finbox, 5-Year Beta). This reflects slightly higher volatility than the market average, which is reasonable for a technology-based company in a competitive ecommerce landscape.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.34% + 1.26 * 5.0% = 10.64%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $251M / $7,162M = **3.5%**. This reflects the company's historical cost of debt.
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 3.5% * (1 - 19.0%) = **2.84%**.

16. **WACC Calculation:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1-t)`
    *   Market Cap (E): $98.86 \* 481M shares = $47,552M.
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $7,162M.
    *   WACC = ($47,552 / $54,714) \* 10.64% + ($7,162 / $54,714) \* 2.84% = **9.30%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Gordon Growth Method Cross-Check:** `TV = (FCFF_Year5 * (1+g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. Capped at long-run inflation expectations.
    *   TV = ($2,730 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0930 - 0.025) = **$41,151 M**.

18. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $2,700M + $415M = $3,115M.
    *   A realistic 5-10 year median EV/EBITDA multiple for a mature tech company like eBay is in the 8x-12x range. A **10x multiple** is a reasonable and realistic assumption.
    *   TV (Exit Multiple) = $3,115M \* 10.0 = **$31,150 M**.
    *   **Comparison:** The Gordon Growth method, with the revised FCFF, implies an exit multiple of $41,151M / $3,115M = **13.2x EV/EBITDA**. This is on the higher end for a mature company like eBay. The Exit Multiple method, using a more conservative and realistic 10x multiple, results in a lower Terminal Value of $31,150 M, which I will use for the valuation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF:
        *   Year 1: $2,432 / (1.093)^1 = $2,225 M
        *   Year 2: $2,515 / (1.093)^2 = $2,112 M
        *   Year 3: $2,591 / (1.093)^3 = $1,992 M
        *   Year 4: $2,664 / (1.093)^4 = $1,880 M
        *   Year 5: $2,730 / (1.093)^5 = $1,770 M
        *   **Total PV of Explicit FCFF = $9,979 M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $31,150 / (1.093)^5 = **$19,997 M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $9,979 M + $19,997 M = $29,976 M**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   Net Debt = $7,162M (Total Debt) - $2,070M (Cash) = $5,092M. (stockanalysis.com, June 30, 2025)
    *   **Equity Value = $29,976 M - $5,092 M = $24,884 M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Year 5 Share Count = 481M \* (1 - 0.025)^5 = **424 M shares**.
    *   **Fair Value Per Share = $24,884 M / 424 M = $58.69**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$58.69**. Assumes 4.0% revenue growth tapering to 2.5%, stable 22.1% EBIT margins, SBC added back as non-cash, and a 10x exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$44.50**. (Approximation based on 1.5% revenue growth, margin compression to 20.0%, SBC added back, and a lower 8.5x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$76.50**. (Approximation based on 5.5% revenue growth tapering to 3.0%, slight margin expansion to 23.0%, SBC added back, and an 11.5x exit multiple).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value.
    *   MOS Price = $58.69 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$41.08**

---

**Risk Notes**

*   **Intense Competition:** eBay faces significant competition from larger players like Amazon and specialized niche marketplaces, which could pressure growth and margins.
*   **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As a marketplace for many discretionary goods, eBay's GMV is sensitive to downturns in consumer spending caused by inflation, high-interest rates, or economic uncertainty.
*   **Execution Risk:** The success of the valuation thesis depends on management's ability to execute its strategy to grow "Focus Categories" and innovate with new features to attract and retain users.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The company is subject to a complex web of global regulations, including e-commerce liability, tax collection (e.g., Form 1099-K), and data privacy laws, which could increase compliance costs.

final answer is $58.69
