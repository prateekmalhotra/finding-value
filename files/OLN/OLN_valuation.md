### B) Management Guidance Extraction
Key guidance from the Q1 2025 earnings call on May 2, 2025:
*   **Full Year Outlook**: "Against the backdrop of heightened macro uncertainty, we expect our second quarter 2025 adjusted EBITDA to be in a broader range of $170 million to $210 million."
*   **Cost Savings**: "we're increasing our cost reduction target to $50 million to $70 million related to productivity and structural cost improvements for full year 2025."
*   **Capital Allocation**: Management reiterated a commitment to maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet and funding sustaining capital expenditures.
*   **Demand Environment**: "building and construction automotive and consumer electronics demand remain weak in the US and Europe. we are seeing mild seasonal demand improvement. but nothing we would consider as demand recovery."

### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)
1.  **Revenue Forecast**: No explicit revenue growth guidance was provided. Given the weak demand environment cited by management and recent performance, a conservative growth rate is warranted. A -2.0% decline is projected for Year 1, followed by a modest recovery to 1.5% annually for Years 2-5, reflecting a slow economic normalization.
2.  **Margin Path**: The TTM operating margin is 2.93%. We will use the average operating margin from the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024), which is approximately 12.1%, as a baseline for the forecast period, assuming a recovery from the current trough. This margin is held flat, as management has not guided for specific expansion initiatives beyond cost savings.
3.  **Taxes**: The average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years (2022-2024) is approximately 22.0%. This rate will be used for the forecast. (2024: 25.9%, 2023: 19.2%, 2022: 20.8%)
4.  **Capital Intensity**:
    *   **Capex**: Management guided FY2025 capital spending to be in the "$225 million to $250 million range". (10-K, Feb 20, 2025) The midpoint, $237.5 million, will be used for Year 1 and grown in line with revenue thereafter.
    *   **Working Capital**: The historical 3-year average change in working capital as a percentage of the change in revenue will be used. Given the volatility, we will model Change in NWC as 1.5% of the change in sales.
5.  **SBC and Dilution**: Stock-Based Compensation is treated as a cash expense. The latest TTM figure of $20.9 million is held flat. The latest diluted share count of 116.0 million is used for the final valuation.

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction
Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Δ in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation**

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,529.7 | $6,627.7 | $6,727.1 | $6,828.0 | $6,930.4 |
| EBIT (12.1% Margin) | $790.1 | $802.0 | $813.9 | $826.2 | $838.6 |
| NOPAT | $616.3 | $625.5 | $634.9 | $644.4 | $654.1 |
| D&A | $521.5 | $521.5 | $521.5 | $521.5 | $521.5 |
| Capex | ($237.5) | ($241.1) | ($244.7) | ($248.3) | ($252.0) |
| Δ in Working Capital | $2.0 | ($1.5) | ($1.5) | ($1.5) | ($1.5) |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($20.9) | ($20.9) | ($20.9) | ($20.9) | ($20.9) |
| **FCFF** | **$881.4** | **$883.6** | **$889.2** | **$895.2** | **$901.1** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)
1.  **Cost of Equity (CAPM)**:
    *   **Risk-Free Rate**: 4.30% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)**: 5.0% (standard market premium).
    *   **Beta**: 1.53. This reflects higher volatility than the market average, which is appropriate for a cyclical chemicals company.
    *   **Cost of Equity** = 4.30% + 1.53 * 5.0% = **11.95%**
2.  **Cost of Debt**:
    *   Interest Expense (TTM) / Total Debt (TTM) = $188.6M / $3,284.1M = 5.74%.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.74% * (1 - 22.0%) = **4.48%**
3.  **WACC Calculation**:
    *   Market Value of Equity (Market Cap): $2.44 Billion.
    *   Market Value of Debt: $3.28 Billion.
    *   WACC = (E / (E+D)) * CoE + (D / (E+D)) * CoD * (1-T)
    *   WACC = ($2.44B / $5.72B) * 11.95% + ($3.28B / $5.72B) * 4.48% = **7.66%**

### F) Terminal Value
1.  **Gordon Growth Method**: A terminal growth rate (g) of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Value = ($901.1M * 1.025) / (7.66% - 2.5%) = **$17,896.7M**
2.  **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**: A historical median multiple is not readily available. The current Enterprise Value/EBITDA is 7.11x. Applying this multiple to Year 5 EBITDA:
    *   EBITDA Year 5 = EBIT Year 5 + D&A = $838.6M + $521.5M = $1,360.1M
    *   Terminal Value (Multiple) = $1,360.1M * 7.11 = $9,670.3M
    *   The Exit Multiple method yields a significantly lower value, suggesting the Gordon Growth perpetuity may be too optimistic. As per instructions, the lower value is chosen. **Terminal Value = $9,670.3M**

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge
1.  **Enterprise Value**:
    *   PV of FCFF (Years 1-5) = $818.7 + $821.1 + $827.1 + $832.3 + $836.8 = **$4,136.0M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $9,670.3M / (1 + 7.66%)^5 = **$6,676.8M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $4,136.0M + $6,676.8M = $10,812.8M**
2.  **Equity Value**:
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $3,284.1M - $223.8M = $3,060.3M.
    *   **Equity Value = $10,812.8M - $3,060.3M = $7,752.5M**

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety
1.  **Base-Case Fair Value**:
    *   Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $7,752.5M / 116.0M = $66.83**
2.  **Valuation Range**:
    *   **Base Case**: **$66.83**. Assumes a recovery to historical average margins and modest long-term growth.
    *   **Low/Bear Case**: **$45.00**. Assumes margins remain compressed at 8% (below historical average) and revenue declines by 1% annually over the forecast period before stabilizing.
    *   **High/Bull Case**: **$85.00**. Assumes stronger revenue recovery (+3% annually after Year 1) and margin expansion to 14% due to successful cost-cutting and favorable market dynamics.
3.  **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**:
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the Base-Case value.
    *   **MOS Price = $66.83 * (1 - 0.30) = $46.78**

### Risk Notes
The key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Cyclicality**: Olin's chemical businesses are highly cyclical and sensitive to global industrial production, construction, and automotive demand. A prolonged downturn would negatively impact revenue and margins. 2) **Input Cost Volatility**: Profitability is exposed to fluctuations in energy and raw material costs (natural gas, ethylene, metals), which can compress margins if not passed through to customers. 3) **Regulatory Risk**: The company faces stringent environmental regulations (e.g., related to asbestos in chlorine production) that could necessitate significant capital expenditures or force plant closures, impacting profitability. 4) **Competitive Pressure**: The global chemical market, particularly for epoxy resins, faces significant competition from Asia, which can lead to pricing pressure and volume loss.

final answer is 66.83 $
