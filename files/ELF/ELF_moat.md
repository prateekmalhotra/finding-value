### 1) Network Effects (weight 18%)
**Reasoning:** e.l.f. Beauty's business model as a cosmetics provider does not create network effects. The value of the product to a customer does not increase as more customers join or use the products. While the company leverages social media for marketing, this is a viral marketing strategy, not a network effect embedded in the product itself.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as selling cosmetics and skin care through retail and direct-to-consumer channels, with no mention of a user-based network driving product value. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** Switching costs in the mass-market cosmetics industry are exceptionally low. Consumers can easily switch between brands like e.l.f. and competitors with minimal financial, technical, or procedural friction. Brand loyalty exists but does not constitute a tangible switching cost.
**Evidence:**
*   The company competes in the mass cosmetics category where consumers are price-sensitive and have numerous options. There is no evidence of contractual lock-in or proprietary technology that would prevent a customer from choosing a competitor's product. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership (weight 15%)
**Reasoning:** e.l.f. has a clear and durable strategy of offering products at a significant price discount to legacy and prestige brands, suggesting a structural cost advantage. This is a core part of its value proposition and has been maintained for over two decades. While tariffs can impact margins, the company's ability to maintain low price points is a key differentiator.
**Evidence:**
*   Management stated the average price point for e.l.f. cosmetics is about $6.50, compared to nearly $9.50 for legacy mass brands and over $20 for prestige brands. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
*   The company has only implemented three price increases in its 21-year history, the most recent being a $1 increase to mitigate tariff impacts, with 75% of the portfolio remaining under $10. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP (weight 12%)
**Reasoning:** e.l.f. has a strong brand, particularly with younger demographics, built on accessibility, quality, and a cruelty-free ethos. However, the company does not appear to possess significant defensible intellectual property like patents that would lock out competitors. The brand's strength is a valuable asset but is less durable than a patent portfolio.
**Evidence:**
*   e.l.f. is described as "one of the most talked about beauty brands in the world," indicating high brand awareness and cultural relevance. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
*   The business model is based on taking inspiration from prestige products and community feedback, rather than groundbreaking, patent-protected innovation. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** e.l.f. has successfully built a significant distribution network with major national retailers like Target, Walmart, and Dollar General, gaining significant market share. This shelf space is a competitive advantage that is difficult for new entrants to replicate quickly. The company is actively expanding its footprint within these retailers.
**Evidence:**
*   In Target, its longest-standing national retail customer, e.l.f. is the #1 cosmetics brand with approximately 21% share, growing 190 basis points in Q1. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
*   The company posted triple-digit share gains with all major track channel retail partners in Q1 and is expanding its footprint in retailers like Dollar General. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage (weight 10%)
**Reasoning:** While e.l.f. uses community insights to drive product innovation, there is no evidence of a proprietary, hard-to-replicate dataset that creates a significant feedback loop or competitive advantage. The data is primarily from public social media and community engagement, which competitors can also access. The advantage is in execution and speed, not a unique data asset.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states it has a "unique ability to deliver a steady stream of holy grails, taking inspiration from our community." This points to a reactive use of public data rather than a proprietary data asset. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects (weight 8%)
**Reasoning:** e.l.f. does not operate an ecosystem or platform model. It does not have a marketplace for third-party products, developers, or integrations that would create lock-in or additional value. The company's recent acquisition of Rhode is an expansion of its own brand portfolio, not the creation of a platform.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is a portfolio of brands (e.l.f., Rhode, etc.) sold through retail and DTC channels. There is no mention of third-party integrations or a developer ecosystem. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers (weight 6%)
**Reasoning:** The mass cosmetics industry generally has low regulatory barriers to entry compared to industries like pharmaceuticals or banking. There is no evidence that e.l.f. possesses unique licenses or benefits from specific regulations that would deter competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   *Inference:* The absence of any mention of patents, exclusive licenses, or regulatory hurdles in the earnings call, which focused on brand, distribution, and price, suggests this is not a significant factor. A definitive assessment would require the 10-K, but a conservative score is warranted.
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity (weight 4%)
**Reasoning:** While the company has working capital needs, the capital intensity to compete in cosmetics (primarily product formulation, marketing, and distribution) is relatively low compared to heavy industry. There are no massive, specific assets that a competitor would be deterred by having to replicate.
**Evidence:**
*   *Inference:* The business model appears asset-light, focusing on brand and supply chain management rather than owning a large, specialized manufacturing footprint. The lack of available SEC filings prevents a detailed analysis of CapEx as a percentage of revenue, forcing a conservative score.
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility (weight 2%)
**Reasoning:** As a consumer goods company selling directly to consumers and through retailers, e.l.f. does not have long-term customer contracts that provide recurring revenue visibility. Sales are transactional, and revenue depends on continuous consumer purchasing decisions.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is based on discrete sales of cosmetic products through retailers and its own website, not on a contractual or subscription basis. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(0 * 0.18) + (0 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (0 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 0 + 0 + 4.5 + 3.6 + 3.0 + 1.0 + 0 + 0 + 0.4 + 0 = **12.5**

**Final Weighted Score:** 12.5 / 100

### Mapping to Moat Rating
A weighted score of 12.5 falls into the 10-30 range.
*   Weighted ≥ 85 → 5
*   70 ≤ Weighted < 85 → 4
*   50 ≤ Weighted < 70 → 3
*   30 ≤ Weighted < 50 → 2
*   **10 ≤ Weighted < 30 → 1**
*   Weighted < 10 → 0

*Correction to Preliminary Rating:* The initial preliminary rating was an estimate. The calculated weighted score maps to a final rating of 1.

### Moat Duration Justification
The company's competitive advantages are primarily its low-price value proposition and a strong, trendy brand. These advantages are susceptible to erosion from competitor pricing actions and shifts in consumer tastes. Without durable assets like patents or high switching costs, the moat's durability is estimated to be short, likely in the **3-5 year** range, contingent on management's ability to maintain brand relevance and cost discipline.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Brand Relevance Fades:** The e.l.f. brand, which is its strongest asset, could lose its appeal with its core demographic as new trends and "dupe" brands emerge on social media platforms, eroding its market share.
2.  **Loss of Shelf Space:** A key retailer like Target or Walmart could reduce e.l.f.'s shelf space in favor of a competitor or private-label products, severely impacting its distribution advantage. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).
3.  **Input Cost Inflation:** Significant inflation in raw materials or unfavorable tariff changes could compress gross margins, forcing e.l.f. to either raise prices—damaging its core value proposition—or accept lower profitability. (e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. (ELF) Q1 2026 Earnings Call Transcript, August 6, 2025).

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Market Share Growth (by retailer):** Track Nielsen or other tracked channel data. A deceleration or decline would signal erosion of the distribution moat.
*   **Gross Margin %:** Monitor quarterly reports. A sustained compression could indicate a loss of cost advantage.
*   **Social Media Sentiment/Share of Voice:** Track mentions and sentiment on platforms like TikTok and Instagram. A decline would be a leading indicator of fading brand relevance.
*   **International Sales Growth %:** Continued high growth is key to the equity story. A slowdown could signal the brand isn't translating well globally.
*   **Average Product Price Point vs. Competitors:** Track the price gap. If the gap narrows, the cost advantage is weakening.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. possesses a narrow economic moat derived from its tangible cost advantage and its intangible, yet powerful, brand. The company has demonstrated a strong ability to gain market share through its low-price, high-value proposition and effective, culturally-relevant marketing. However, the lack of significant switching costs, network effects, or intellectual property makes this moat fragile and susceptible to competitive pressure and shifts in consumer preferences. A change in the rating would require evidence of either a significant, durable margin advantage over peers (as seen in a full 10-K) or a structural shift in its distribution network that creates higher barriers to entry for competitors.

moat rating is 1 / 5
