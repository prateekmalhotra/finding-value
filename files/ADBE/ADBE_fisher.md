**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe maintains impressive profit margins. For the three months ended May 30, 2025, the company's gross profit margin was approximately 89%, and its operating profit margin was approximately 36%. These margins are indicative of a strong and profitable business model. The Q1 2024 non-GAAP operating margin was 46.2%.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000073/adbe-20250530.htm" (May 30, 2025)], ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGGcJ8vLphzbCnne3vGjkBpJYRphk0vAcrDSmuUYt3o2d4_tRRRvxFvoA1JBJjhENf1JQQOmRY-vmNUnrOFqeq24aC-hUX_LoH0wlRZsjjGsNIdSXmPubwGy-QCAZQ=" (2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's fiscal 2024 total attrition rate was 7.8%, which is a relatively low figure in the competitive tech industry. The company states, "We have not experienced work stoppages and believe our employee relations are good." Adobe's focus on a hybrid work model and employee well-being suggests a positive approach to personnel relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000004/adbe-20241129.htm" (November 29, 2024)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's executive team demonstrates stability, with several key leaders having long tenures with the company. Shantanu Narayen has been CEO since 2007. The executive team has a mix of long-serving members and newer additions, suggesting a blend of experience and fresh perspectives.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's management team has a clear structure with presidents for its major business units, Digital Media and Digital Experience.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's financial reporting is detailed and transparent, with clear segmentation of revenue and costs. The company's independent registered public accounting firm has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. There is no evidence of significant accounting issues or restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000073/adbe-20250530.htm" (May 30, 2025)], ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000004/adbe-20241129.htm" (November 29, 2024)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's key competitive advantage is its deeply entrenched ecosystem of creative and document software. The seamless integration between its flagship products like Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere Pro creates a high switching cost for users. This "moat" is further strengthened by the network effects of its creative community (Behance) and the industry-standard status of its file formats (PDF, PSD). Adobe's dominant market share in creative software (60%) and PDF solutions (70%) are strong indicators of its competitive strength.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000004/adbe-20241129.htm" (November 29, 2024)], ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGGcJ8vLphzbCnne3vGjkBpJYRphk0vAcrDSmuUYt3o2d4_tRRRvxFvoA1JBJjhENf1JQQOmRY-vmNUnrOFqeq24aC-hUX_LoH0wlRZsjjGsNIdSXmPubwGy-QCAZQ=" (2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's consistent and significant investment in R&D demonstrates a long-term focus. The company's emphasis on developing and integrating AI capabilities across its product portfolio, even with the associated costs, points to a strategy of prioritizing long-term market leadership over short-term profit maximization. The company's detailed discussion of its long-term growth strategies in its 10-K filing also supports this view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000004/adbe-20241129.htm" (November 29, 2024)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe has a strong financial position with significant cash flow from operations. For the six months ended May 30, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $4.673 billion. The company has a substantial stock repurchase program, having repurchased $6.75 billion of its common stock in the same period, which counteracts dilution from employee stock plans. Adobe's strong balance sheet and access to debt markets make it unlikely that it would need to resort to dilutive equity financing for growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000073/adbe-20250530.htm" (May 30, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adobe's management provides detailed financial results and business updates in its quarterly earnings calls and SEC filings. The Q2 2025 earnings call transcript shows a willingness to discuss both positive results and potential challenges. For instance, the company provides detailed forward-looking guidance, which demonstrates transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGgTPza_r8OuvSBzKsTYSdS3-hZyLJUuxFiGUlAHCObLqZkAjHjsOKvTbgGyQPS0FYK34hZj4R6ChUsxaciHeTkvftZ9yQjEBP2IK6pZD8V6oS9m77Ko5004FIZ8ke_pHulaGqyICQ0gS6CEaim-VeMRZvt7xSWOe6Wfy47wRkJW1bhTXDZzhvHwU71zUTaOrhlZVc=" (June 12, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided SEC filings of any material legal or regulatory issues that would question the integrity of the management team. The company has a code of business conduct and other governance policies in place. The primary legal proceeding of note is a civil complaint from the DOJ regarding subscription cancellation practices, but this does not, on its own, indicate a lack of integrity across the management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/796343/000079634325000073/adbe-20250530.htm" (May 30, 2025)]

---
**Synthesis:**
Adobe scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong market position, consistent growth, and commitment to innovation. The company's primary strengths lie in its dominant market share in creative software, its successful subscription model that generates predictable revenue and high margins, and its forward-looking investment in AI. The biggest variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months are the competitive landscape in AI-native creative tools and the outcome of the DOJ lawsuit. A significant loss of market share to AI-powered competitors or a major adverse ruling in the lawsuit could turn some "Yes" answers to "No." To maintain its high score, Adobe will need to continue to demonstrate the value of its integrated ecosystem in the face of new competition and resolve the regulatory challenges without significant damage to its business model or reputation.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
