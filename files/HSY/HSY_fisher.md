### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**  
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey is the largest producer of quality chocolate in North America and a leading snack maker in the United States, operating in highly competitive markets. The company is focused on broadening its participation in the broader snacking category beyond its core confectionery business. This strategy includes expanding its core brands into new snacking occasions and increasing exposure to new categories through acquisitions like Dot's Homestyle Pretzels and Sour Strips. While the core U.S. confectionery market is mature, Hershey is leveraging its brand power to capture growth in the larger snacking industry, which provides a runway for future sales growth.  
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey's management demonstrates a clear commitment to ongoing development through both innovation and acquisition. The company states that innovation is a key component of its strategy, leveraging a proprietary analytical tool to shape future product development and focusing on platform innovations for sustainable growth. Recent acquisitions, such as Sour Strips in November 2024 and manufacturing assets from Weaver Popcorn in May 2023, show a commitment to expanding the portfolio and strengthening supply chain capabilities. The "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative" approved in February 2024 aims to leverage new technology and business models to generate long-term savings and simplify processes.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey's research and development expenses were $55.8 million in 2024, approximately 0.5% of net sales. This is comparable to, though slightly lower than, some peers in the food and beverage industry. The company's R&D activities are focused on developing new products, improving existing ones, and modernizing production processes across its global locations. The effectiveness is demonstrated through successful brand extensions and the integration of acquired brands, which leverage Hershey's scale and expertise in brand building to drive growth in new snack categories.  
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey has a powerful sales and distribution network, with products sold under more than 90 brand names in approximately 70 countries. Its customers include wholesale distributors, chain grocery stores, mass merchandisers, and convenience stores, among others. One customer, McLane Company, Inc., which is the primary distributor to Walmart, accounted for approximately 27% of consolidated net sales in 2024, indicating deep penetration in key retail channels. The company's marketing strategy is built on strong brand equities and an efficient distribution network that facilitates superior customer service and sales growth.  
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Hershey reported a gross margin of 47.3% and an operating profit margin of 25.9%. This represents a significant increase from the 44.8% gross margin and 22.9% operating margin reported in 2023. The improvement was driven by favorable mark-to-market impacts from commodity derivatives and price realization, which offset higher commodity costs. These margins are generally considered strong within the consumer packaged goods industry.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey actively manages its margins through several strategies. The company implements price increases to offset rising input costs, although this can sometimes lead to volume declines. It uses forward contracts and commodity futures to hedge against price volatility for key inputs like cocoa and sugar. Furthermore, the "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative," a multi-year productivity program, is designed to improve supply chain efficiency, optimize overhead expenses, and generate long-term savings, with expected annual savings of approximately $300 million by 2026.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

The company emphasizes that its employees are critical to its success and highlights investments in safety, training, and employee engagement, including continuous listening surveys. It was recognized as one of the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere and achieved global Great Place to Work certifications in 2024. While no company is without labor issues, the public disclosures and external recognition suggest positive relations.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Hershey appears stable, with many senior leaders having long tenures and being promoted from within, which suggests a healthy internal culture. For instance, the current Chairman, President, and CEO, Michele G. Buck, has been with the company for an extended period. The executive leadership team listed in the 2024 10-K shows a mix of long-serving insiders and newer hires in key roles like President, U.S. Confection, and Chief Technology Officer, indicating a blend of continuity and fresh perspectives.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey's leadership structure includes presidents for its key segments: U.S. Confection, Salty Snacks, and International. The company’s 2024 10-K filing indicates that the majority of its executive officers were promoted from within, suggesting strong talent development and succession planning. The recruitment of external talent for specialized roles, such as the Chief Technology Officer from Amazon, demonstrates a commitment to bringing in necessary expertise to drive future growth initiatives.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for clear analysis of its different business units. Management's discussion and analysis section of the 10-K provides granular detail on the drivers of cost of sales and segment performance. The company is also in the process of a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system to enhance operational functionality and financial records.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the confectionery and snack industry, brand equity and distribution are paramount. Hershey's portfolio includes some of the most iconic and recognized brands in North America, such as *Hershey's*, *Reese's*, and *Kisses*. This brand strength provides significant pricing power and secures valuable shelf space with retailers. The company's vast distribution network, including a key relationship with McLane Company, Inc., ensures its products are ubiquitous in critical channels like convenience stores and mass merchandisers, creating a significant competitive moat.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47111/000004711125000014/hsy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategic initiatives demonstrate a long-range outlook. The company is making significant investments in a new ERP system and the "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative" to drive long-term efficiencies, even with substantial upfront costs. It is also investing in its salty snacks portfolio and international markets to diversify revenue streams for future growth. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, management discussed making strategic investments in brands and capabilities to drive sustainable, balanced growth in the future, even while navigating short-term challenges like high cocoa prices.  
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey generates substantial cash flow from operations, reporting $2.5 billion in 2024. The company funds its capital expenditures, acquisitions, and dividends primarily through cash from operations and debt financing. Hershey has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs, rather than issuing new equity. In December 2023, the Board approved a new $500 million share repurchase authorization, signaling confidence in its cash flow and a commitment to avoiding dilution. The balance sheet is strong, providing access to debt markets as needed.  
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion in the 2024 10-K and earnings calls openly addresses challenges. For example, the "Trends Affecting Our Business" section of the 10-K explicitly discusses the impact of price volatility in commodities like cocoa, declines in consumer demand, and shifts in consumer behavior. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, executives addressed the significant impact of record-high cocoa prices and the resulting pricing strategies and their effects on volume. This transparency regarding both positive performance drivers and significant headwinds indicates a culture of candor.  
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Hershey has a Code of Conduct that applies to all employees and directors, which is available on its website. The company was recognized among the World's Most Ethical Companies by Ethisphere in 2024. A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K and a search of public records reveal no major integrity-related scandals or material litigation against the executive team. The company’s long history, connection to the Milton Hershey School Trust, and consistent public recognition for ethical practices support a conclusion of high integrity.  
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**

The Hershey Company scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its status as a well-managed, dominant player in its core market with a clear strategy for future growth. Its strongest positives are its iconic brand portfolio, which provides a significant competitive moat, its robust profitability, and its strong financial position that allows for reinvestment and shareholder returns without equity dilution. Management demonstrates a long-term perspective by investing in productivity initiatives and strategic acquisitions to expand into the broader snacking category. The primary variable that could change this score in the next 12-24 months is the company's ability to navigate the unprecedented volatility in cocoa prices. While Hershey is actively using pricing and hedging to mitigate this, sustained high prices could test its pricing power and pressure volumes and margins, potentially impacting the long-runway and margin-related points on this checklist. Evidence of successful volume recovery after price increases and stabilization of gross margins would be key to maintaining the perfect score.
