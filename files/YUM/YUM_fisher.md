### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway

**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands operates in the global Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) industry, a massive and growing market. The company's growth strategy relies on new unit development and same-store sales growth, with a significant runway for expansion in international markets. As of year-end 2024, the KFC Division operated in 150 countries and territories, with 89% of its units located internationally, while Taco Bell had only 13% of its units outside the U.S., indicating a substantial opportunity for global expansion. The company opened 4,535 gross new units in 2024, demonstrating a continued focus on expansion to capture a larger share of the global QSR market.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development

**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands is heavily invested in digital and technology to enhance customer experiences and improve efficiency, which management cites as a key enabler of growth. The company has developed its proprietary "Byte by Yum!" platform, a suite of AI-driven software for ordering, kitchen optimization, and management, aiming to drive profitable sales growth across its brands. In 2024, digital sales reached $33 billion, accounting for over 50% of total system sales, highlighting the successful integration of technology into its business model. This focus on technological innovation and new product development demonstrates a clear commitment to future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands' R&D is focused on product innovation, digital technology, and operational efficiency rather than traditional R&D spending. The company's "Byte by Yum!" platform is a key example of its technology-focused R&D, which is being scaled globally to improve operations and customer experience. The effectiveness of these efforts is demonstrated by the significant growth in digital sales, which reached over 50% of system sales in 2024. While specific R&D expenditure figures are not disclosed as a percentage of revenue, the tangible results in digital sales and technological integration suggest an effective R&D strategy relative to its size in the QSR industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands' sales organization is primarily driven by its extensive franchise model, which accounts for 98% of its restaurants. The company's ability to attract and partner with a diverse range of franchisees, from single-unit operators to large public companies, is a testament to the strength of its brands and franchise system. The global scale of over 61,000 restaurants and a presence in more than 155 countries demonstrates a highly effective and above-average sales and distribution network. Furthermore, the company's system-wide sales reached $65.5 billion in 2024, reflecting the powerful reach of its sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Yum! Brands reported an operating profit of $2.4 billion on total revenues of $7.5 billion, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 31.8%. This high margin is a direct result of its heavily franchised model, where the majority of revenue comes from high-margin franchise and property fees rather than lower-margin company-operated restaurant sales. The company's Core Operating Profit, a non-GAAP measure used internally, grew by 9% in 2024, indicating strong and improving profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands focuses on several initiatives to maintain and improve profit margins, including driving same-store sales growth, optimizing its franchise mix, and leveraging technology to enhance efficiency. The company's asset-light, heavily franchised model is central to its margin strategy, as franchise fees are a high-margin revenue stream. Additionally, the implementation of the "Byte by Yum!" technology platform is designed to improve unit economics for both company-owned and franchise stores, which in turn supports margin improvement. Management also noted in its 2024 10-K that it manages commodity price volatility through pricing agreements with vendors and may increase menu prices to offset cost pressures.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands emphasizes human capital management as integral to its growth strategy, focusing on creating an inclusive culture to attract and retain talent. The company reports that approximately 80% of its U.S. Restaurant General Managers are promoted from within, indicating opportunities for career growth. In its most recent global employee engagement survey in 2023, the engagement level of its restaurant support center employees significantly exceeded the average of benchmarked companies. However, the company also acknowledges the challenging labor market, increased labor costs, and employee turnover as risk factors. While the company has positive initiatives, the inherent challenges of the QSR industry prevent a clear "Yes."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Yum! Brands shows a mix of long-tenured leaders and newer executives from outside the company, suggesting a blend of internal experience and fresh perspectives. For instance, CEO David Gibbs has been with the company since at least 2005, holding various leadership roles before becoming CEO in 2020. CFO Christopher Turner joined in 2019 from PepsiCo. This stability at the top, combined with a clear succession plan (e.g., the announced transition for the KFC Division CEO in March 2025), indicates a well-managed executive team. There is no public evidence of significant executive infighting or instability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management

**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands has a well-defined management structure with dedicated leadership for each of its four divisions (KFC, Taco Bell, Pizza Hut, and Habit Burger & Grill). The company's executive officers list in its 2024 10-K includes the CEOs of each division, as well as corporate officers for key functions like legal, finance, and operations, indicating a broad and deep leadership team. The company also highlights its focus on developing world-class leaders as part of its human capital strategy. The recent appointment of a new CEO for the KFC Division, promoted from within the Taco Bell division, further demonstrates the company's management depth and succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large accelerated filer, Yum! Brands is subject to stringent accounting and reporting standards, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, which offers transparency into the performance of each of its brands. There is no evidence of recent material restatements or significant internal control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands' key competitive advantage lies in its massive global scale and its portfolio of iconic, category-leading brands (KFC in chicken, Taco Bell in Mexican-inspired, and Pizza Hut in pizza). This scale allows the company to leverage its purchasing power and invest in technology like the "Byte by Yum!" platform, providing its franchisees with capabilities that smaller competitors cannot match. The company's highly franchised model (98%) is another significant advantage, enabling rapid expansion with lower capital intensity and generating high-margin royalty streams.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands' "Recipe for Good Growth" strategy is explicitly long-term, focusing on building iconic brands, improving customer experiences, and driving higher growth rates. The company's significant investments in digital and technology, such as the global rollout of its "Byte by Yum!" platform, are long-term initiatives aimed at securing future profitability and competitive advantage. Management's discussion of its strategy in the 2024 10-K consistently emphasizes long-term growth and shareholder returns.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yum! Brands generates substantial and consistent cash flow from operations, which was $1.7 billion in 2024. The company's asset-light franchise model minimizes its capital expenditure requirements for growth. Furthermore, the company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, rather than issuing new shares. In May 2024, the Board authorized a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, demonstrating confidence in its cash flow and a commitment to avoiding equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management openly discusses challenges in its public filings and earnings calls. For instance, the 2024 10-K details the negative impact of the conflict in the Middle East on sales in certain markets, quantifying the headwind to same-store sales growth. The company also acknowledges risks related to labor costs, competition, and cybersecurity, including a specific ransomware attack in 2023. This transparency, even regarding negative events, suggests a culture of candor with investors.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no widespread reports of major scandals, fraud, or significant legal issues involving Yum! Brands' senior management. The company's 2024 10-K outlines its Code of Conduct and its commitment to responsible operations. While the company faces various lawsuits and regulatory matters, as is typical for a corporation of its size, there are no red flags that would question the fundamental integrity of its top leadership. For instance, the company is contesting a tax matter with the IRS and a regulatory penalty in India, but it is defending its position vigorously.
**Answer:** Yes

***

**Synthesis:**

Yum! Brands scores favorably across most of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting its status as a well-managed, global leader in the QSR industry. The company's primary strengths lie in its portfolio of iconic brands with a long runway for international growth, a highly profitable and scalable franchise model, and a clear commitment to leveraging technology for future development. Its financial position is robust, with strong cash flow generation and a shareholder-friendly capital return policy that minimizes the risk of equity dilution. The only point of weakness is in labor relations, a persistent challenge across the QSR industry that makes an "outstanding" rating difficult to achieve. The score could be most influenced in the next 12-24 months by the performance of the Taco Bell brand's international expansion, the successful integration and performance of its digital technology initiatives across its franchise system, and its ability to manage the ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic pressures affecting consumer spending and operating costs. A significant and sustained downturn in same-store sales growth or a failure to demonstrate a return on its technology investments would be the most likely factors to negatively impact the company's score.
