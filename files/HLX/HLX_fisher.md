Company: Helix Energy Solutions Group, Inc. (HLX)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K filed February 26, 2025 (for fiscal year ended December 31, 2024).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix operates in three key offshore energy sectors: maximizing production of existing oil and gas reserves, decommissioning end-of-life fields, and supporting renewable energy developments. The company's backlog was $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2024, a significant increase from $850 million the prior year, indicating strong near-term demand. Management expects long-term growth in decommissioning driven by government regulations for aging subsea wells and growth in renewables from offshore wind farm developments. In 2024, 51% of the Robotics segment's revenue came from renewable energy contracts.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix demonstrates a commitment to development through targeted investments and alliances. The company, through its alliance with SLB, jointly developed a 15K Intervention Riser System (IRS) and the Riserless Open-water Abandonment Module (ROAM) to expand its technical capabilities in well intervention. The company is also actively expanding its services for the offshore renewable energy market, which is a key growth area beyond traditional oil and gas services. This strategic focus on high-technology solutions and expansion into adjacent growth markets like renewables indicates a commitment to future development.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company does not explicitly break out Research and Development spending as a line item in its financial statements, making a direct comparison to revenue or peers difficult. However, its effectiveness can be inferred from the development of specialized assets and systems, such as the ROAM and the 15K IRS developed with SLB. These technologies directly support the company's service offerings and competitive position in deepwater well intervention. The focus appears to be on applied technology development integrated into operations rather than pure R&D. Without specific metrics on R&D spending and returns, it is difficult to definitively assess its effectiveness relative to size.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Evidence points to a strong, relationship-based sales effort with major industry players. As of year-end 2024, approximately 90% of the company's $1.4 billion backlog was concentrated with five customers, including Shell, ExxonMobil, Trident Energy, and Petrobras. For the fiscal year 2024, major customers Shell and Talos accounted for 12% of revenue each. This high concentration with supermajors and national oil companies suggests a sophisticated sales and service organization capable of winning large, multi-year contracts. The significant year-over-year increase in backlog further supports this.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Helix reported a consolidated gross margin of 16% and income from operations margin of 9.4%. The Well Intervention and Robotics segments, the company's core focus, reported gross margins of 13% and 30%, respectively. However, the recently acquired Shallow Water Abandonment segment posted a negative gross margin for the year, dragging down consolidated profitability. While the Robotics margin is strong, the overall company margins are modest and subject to segment-specific pressures.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion indicates a focus on securing higher-rate contracts and improving vessel utilization as primary drivers for margin improvement, as seen in the Well Intervention segment's performance in 2024. The company is also positioning itself in higher-margin growth areas like renewables and deepwater decommissioning. The 2024 10-K mentions ongoing efforts to "control costs and improve performance" as a standard business practice. However, specific, company-wide margin improvement programs or cost-cutting initiatives are not detailed in the report. The significant gross loss in the Shallow Water Abandonment segment indicates that margin improvement actions have not been effective across the entire company.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Helix had 2,313 employees, with 446 covered by collective bargaining agreements. The company states it considers its "overall relationships with our employees, suppliers and vendors to be satisfactory." It highlights a corporate culture where safety (QHSE) is prioritized, and employees have "STOP WORK" authority. The company tracks its global voluntary annual turnover rate, which was 14% as of December 31, 2024. This level of turnover and the presence of unionized staff suggest relations are functional, but there is no specific evidence to classify them as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows significant stability and long tenure. Owen Kratz, President and CEO, has been with the company since 1984 and has served as CEO for the majority of the time since 1997. Other named executives, Erik Staffeldt (CFO), Scott Sparks (COO), and Kenneth Neikirk (General Counsel), have all been with Helix since at least 2009. This long tenure at the highest levels suggests a stable and cohesive executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings name four executive officers: CEO, CFO, COO, and General Counsel. While these individuals have extensive experience, the 10-K does not provide significant detail on the next layer of management or discuss formal succession planning. The long tenure of the key executives could also be viewed as a potential key-person risk if succession is not clearly articulated. The information provided is insufficient to confirm management depth beyond the top-level executives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes an audit report from its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's own report on internal control also asserts its effectiveness. The company breaks down its results into four reportable segments, providing a degree of transparency into its cost structure. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or recent restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Helix's key competitive advantage is its fleet of purpose-built well intervention vessels (e.g., Q4000, Q5000, Q7000), which are more cost-effective and efficient for subsea well maintenance and decommissioning than traditional drilling rigs. The company notes these vessels "derive competitive advantages from their lower operating costs, with an ability to mobilize quickly and to maximize operational time." This specialized asset base in a niche, high-tech segment of the offshore market, including advanced robotics capabilities for renewables, provides a distinct competitive moat versus more generalized service companies or capital-intensive drilling contractors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. It is actively investing in and positioning its Robotics segment to service the offshore wind market, a long-term energy transition trend, which comprised 51% of that segment's revenue in 2024. Furthermore, the company undertakes significant capital projects, such as vessel upgrades, to extend the lives of its assets and maintain their competitiveness over the long term. The emphasis on securing multi-year contracts, even if they require significant mobilization or upfront costs, also points to a focus on long-term profitability and stability over short-term results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, the company had a strong liquidity position with $368 million in cash and cash equivalents and $66.6 million of available borrowing capacity, against $315.2 million of total debt. The company generated $163 million in Free Cash Flow in 2024. In February 2023, the Board authorized a $200 million share repurchase program, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, not diluting them. The company explicitly states its capital allocation policy includes using Free Cash Flow for share repurchases.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Analysis of this point requires reviewing a series of communications over time, especially during challenging periods, which is not fully possible with a single 10-K filing. However, the Risk Factors section of the 10-K is extensive and candidly discusses a wide range of potential negative impacts, from industry downturns and contract cancellations to operational risks and competition. The report also clearly breaks out the poor performance of the Shallow Water Abandonment segment, showing a gross loss, rather than obscuring it. This level of disclosure suggests a culture of transparency, but without access to earnings call transcripts from difficult quarters, a definitive "Yes" is not possible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the 2024 10-K reveals no significant red flags regarding management integrity. The section on "Legal Proceedings" does not disclose any material litigation related to executive misconduct. The company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and the audit report is clean. There are no disclosed related-party transactions that appear problematic. Without evidence of legal or regulatory actions, governance scandals, or major shareholder disputes related to integrity, the available information supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/866829/000155837025001617/hlx-20241231x10k.htm, filed February 26, 2025]

---
**Synthesis:**
Based on an analysis of the most recently available annual report, Helix Energy Solutions scores positively on its long-term market runway, stable executive relations, strong financial position, and unique competitive niche with its specialized vessel fleet. The company is successfully positioning itself to capitalize on long-term trends in energy, including decommissioning and offshore renewables. However, the score is held back by a lack of evidence for effective R&D, mediocre and inconsistent profit margins across segments, and unproven management depth beyond the key executives. The most critical variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to improve profitability in the underperforming Shallow Water Abandonment segment and its capacity to maintain high utilization and pricing for its well intervention fleet as new contracts begin. A "No" on profit margins would flip to "Yes" with evidence of sustained, company-wide gross margins above 20% and a clear strategy that addresses losses in weaker segments. Similarly, a "No" on management depth could change with disclosures around succession planning or a broader profile of key operational leaders. Access to the latest 2025 quarterly filings and earnings call transcripts would be essential to update this analysis.

fisher score is 9 / 15
