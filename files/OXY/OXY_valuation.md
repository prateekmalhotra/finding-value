Of course. Here is a critical review and a revised valuation of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, addressing the issues in the original analysis while maintaining the requested format and detail.

### **Critique of Original Valuation**

The provided valuation is well-structured and follows a standard methodology. However, several core assumptions and calculations lead to a result that is likely too conservative for a base-case scenario.

1.  **Overly Pessimistic Revenue Assumption:** The assumption of a **-2.0% annual revenue decline** for five consecutive years is more characteristic of a bear-case or recessionary scenario. For a base case, it's more realistic to assume the company can at least maintain production, with revenue reflecting modest inflation or a normalized commodity price environment. A perpetual decline is a significant negative outlook that heavily penalizes the valuation.

2.  **Inconsistent Capital Expenditure Logic:** The model assumes $6.5 billion in annual capex, which aligns with guidance for *maintaining and developing* assets. It is inconsistent to assume the company spends this amount only to see its revenue consistently decline by 2% each year. This level of spending should, at a minimum, support stable-to-modestly-growing production.

3.  **Incorrect Working Capital Calculation:** For a company with declining revenue, changes in working capital should typically be a *source* of cash (a positive inflow), as receivables and inventory are reduced. The original model incorrectly shows it as a small cash *outflow* (a negative impact on FCFF).

4.  **Unrealistic Terminal Value:** This is the most significant issue. The Gordon Growth model resulted in an implied **EV/EBITDA multiple of 3.68x**. This is well below the historical average for the E&P sector (typically 5.0x - 7.0x), suggesting a company in terminal decline. Using a method that produces such a low multiple is not reflective of a stable, ongoing enterprise and unduly punishes the valuation. An Exit Multiple approach, grounded in industry norms, is more appropriate here.

The combination of these factors, particularly the revenue decline and low terminal value, produces a fair value estimate ($20.61) that represents a distressed or deep cyclical-trough valuation rather than a balanced, mid-cycle base case.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section is largely unchanged, as its logic is sound for illustrating the market's current expectations.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $45.78 (Investing.com, August 22, 2025).

2.  **Baseline Financials (LTM - Last Twelve Months):**
| Metric | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $27,458 |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $4,789 |
| Net Income | $2,730 |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $5,432 |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $210 |
| Capital Expenditures | ($6,350) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($180) |
| Interest Expense | $1,287 |
| Cash & Equivalents | $1,345 |
| Total Debt | $18,950 |
| Diluted Weighted-Avg. Shares | 884 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

*   **Preliminary WACC:** Using a WACC of 9.35% (calculated in Part 2), a terminal EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.0x, and holding operating margins constant at the LTM level of 17.4%.
*   **Implied Growth:** A reverse DCF model indicates the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 7.1%**.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify today's stock price of $45.78, the market is pricing in expectations of over 7% annual revenue growth for the next five years while maintaining current margins. This is an optimistic outlook that would require a sustained high-price commodity environment or significant production growth.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on revised, more realistic assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The market's implied 7.1% growth is aggressive. However, the original analysis's -2.0% decline was overly pessimistic. A more balanced base case is needed.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1â€“5:** I will use a **2.0% annual revenue growth** rate. This modest growth reflects a combination of maintaining production levels, achieving slight operational growth, and long-term inflation, providing a more realistic base case than assuming a continuous decline.

8.  **Margin Path:** I will continue to use the 3-year average operating margin of **19.5%**. This normalizes for recent fluctuations and represents a sustainable mid-cycle profitability level.

9.  **Taxes:** The effective tax rate of **22%** remains a reasonable, normalized assumption.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Maintained at **$6,500 million annually**. This level of investment is now consistent with supporting the modest 2.0% revenue growth assumption.
    *   **Working Capital:** Correctly modeled as 0.5% of the *change* in revenue. As revenue now increases, this will be a modest use of cash.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   SBC will be subtracted from FCFF at the 3-year average of **$200 million** per year.
    *   A net **1.0% annual reduction in shares outstanding** is a reasonable assumption given OXY's commitment to shareholder returns via buybacks.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital.

**Revised FCFF Forecast (in millions):**
| Year | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $28,007 | $28,567 | $29,139 | $29,722 | $30,316 |
| EBIT | $5,461 | $5,571 | $5,682 | $5,796 | $5,912 |
| NOPAT | $4,260 | $4,345 | $4,432 | $4,521 | $4,611 |
| D&A | $5,450 | $5,450 | $5,450 | $5,450 | $5,450 |
| SBC | ($200) | ($200) | ($200) | ($200) | ($200) |
| Capex | ($6,500) | ($6,500) | ($6,500) | ($6,500) | ($6,500) |
| Change in WC | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) |
| **FCFF** | **$3,007** | **$3,092** | **$3,179** | **$3,268** | **$3,358** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0%.
    *   **Beta:** 1.40 (Reflects OXY's volatility and leverage).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.40 * 5.0% = 11.25%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 6.8% * (1 - 22%) = **5.30%**

16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity = $45.78 * 884M shares = $40,469M.
    *   Market Value of Debt = $18,950M.
    *   Total Value (V) = $59,419M.
    *   **WACC = (40,469/59,419 * 11.25%) + (18,950/59,419 * 5.30%) = 7.66% + 1.69% = 9.35%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Exit Multiple Method:** The Gordon Growth method produced an unrealistic result in the original analysis. The Exit Multiple method is more appropriate for a cyclical company. A mid-cycle **EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.0x** is a realistic and defensible assumption for a mature E&P company.

18. **Terminal Value Calculation:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $5,912M + $5,450M = $11,362M.
    *   **Terminal Value = $11,362M * 6.0x = $68,172 million.**

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of FCFF = $3,007/(1.0935)^1 + ... + $3,358/(1.0935)^5 = $12,710M.
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $68,172 / (1.0935)^5 = $43,598M.
    *   **Enterprise Value = $12,710M + $43,598M = $56,308M.**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $18,950M - $1,345M = $17,605M.
    *   **Equity Value = $56,308M - $17,605M = $38,703M.**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Year 5 Shares = 884M * (1 - 0.01)^5 = 841M.
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $38,703M / 841M shares = $46.02 per share.**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$46.02**. Assumes 2.0% revenue growth, 19.5% margins, and a 6.0x exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$35.50**. Assumes -1.0% revenue decline, 18% margins, and a 5.0x exit multiple, reflecting a cyclical downturn.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$58.00**. Assumes 4.0% revenue growth, 21% margins, and a 7.0x exit multiple, reflecting a favorable commodity cycle.

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety from the base-case estimate is applied.
    *   **MOS Price = $46.02 * (1 - 0.30) = $32.21.**

**Risk Notes**
The key risks to this valuation are: 1) **Commodity Price Volatility:** The company's revenue and profitability are directly tied to the volatile prices of crude oil and natural gas. 2) **Leverage:** Occidental maintains a significant debt load, making it vulnerable to interest rate fluctuations and constraining capital allocation. 3) **Execution Risk:** The company's long-term strategy involves significant investment in carbon capture technologies, which carry substantial technological and commercialization risks.

final answer is 46.02 $
