Company: H2O America (HTO)
Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a water utility, H2O America operates in a market with perpetual demand. Growth is driven by population increases in its service areas and, crucially, by capital investments into its water systems that expand its rate base. The company's 2024 10-K outlines a significant capital expenditure plan focused on infrastructure replacement and improvements to meet water quality standards. These non-discretionary investments provide a clear, regulated path to revenue growth for the foreseeable future as they are recovered through approved rate increases.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a utility, "development" translates to modernizing infrastructure and improving operational efficiency. Management's commitment is demonstrated through its consistent capital investment programs aimed at enhancing water treatment, supply, and distribution. The Q2 2025 earnings call transcript details ongoing projects and the company’s focus on securing timely regulatory approval for these investments, which are the primary mechanism for increasing the earnings power of the business. This represents a continuous "development" of their core service infrastructure.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Water utilities do not have traditional R&D departments in the way a technology or pharmaceutical company does. H2O America's filings do not specify a budget or department for research and development, as its business model is focused on capital expenditure within a regulated framework. While the company adopts new technologies for operational efficiency, there is no evidence of a formal R&D effort designed to create new products or services.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000080/hto-20250630.htm']

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A regulated utility like H2O America does not have a conventional sales organization. It operates as a monopoly within its designated service territories. Revenue growth is not achieved through competitive sales but through rate cases with public utility commissions that are based on capital invested and operating costs. The company's filings make no mention of a sales or marketing division, which is typical for this industry.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, H2O America reported an operating margin that is consistent with or above the average for the regulated water utility industry. The company's ability to work with regulators to recover costs and earn an approved rate of return on its capital investments ensures the stability of these margins. The long-term trend, evidenced in past 10-K filings, shows consistent profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000080/hto-20250630.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** H2O America focuses on two primary levers to maintain and improve margins: disciplined operational expense control and proactive regulatory affairs. Management detailed in the Q2 2025 earnings call their strategy of filing timely rate cases to reflect the costs of capital improvements and inflation. Furthermore, they are investing in technology like advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to reduce operating costs and improve efficiency over the long term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HTO/transcripts/']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K notes that a portion of its workforce is unionized and describes the relationship as "constructive." There is no disclosure of recent strikes, lockouts, or significant labor disputes in the past several years of filings. While the absence of negative disclosures is a positive sign, there is not sufficient affirmative evidence, such as employee satisfaction scores or turnover metrics, to definitively conclude that relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm']

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team listed in the 2024 10-K shows stability, with most key leaders having long tenure at the company. This suggests a cohesive and stable management environment. There are no reported controversies or evidence of significant infighting among the executive team or with the board of directors in public filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** H2O America’s public filings, including the annual 10-K, identify a number of key executives beyond the CEO and CFO who are responsible for distinct operating regions and core functions like engineering and finance. The company’s long history and succession planning, as occasionally mentioned in investor presentations, suggest a bench of experienced leaders is being cultivated. During the Q2 2025 earnings call, several executives spoke to their areas of responsibility, demonstrating a breadth of leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HTO/transcripts/']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm. Furthermore, management’s report on internal control over financial reporting asserted that such controls were effective as of December 31, 2024. There is no history of material restatements or disclosed material weaknesses, indicating robust and reliable accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the water utility industry, key differentiators are constructive regulatory relationships and strong water supply rights. H2O America's consistent record of successful rate case outcomes, detailed in its quarterly and annual filings, points to an effective regulatory strategy. The company's 2024 10-K also provides a detailed overview of its diverse water sources, which is a significant asset in ensuring supply reliability, particularly in regions prone to drought.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The entire business model of a regulated utility is predicated on a long-range outlook. H2O America consistently makes significant capital expenditures that may pressure near-term earnings and cash flow but are essential for the long-term growth of its rate base and, consequently, its future profits. Management’s discussion in the 2024 10-K and earnings calls focuses on a multi-year investment plan, demonstrating that profitability is viewed through a long-term lens.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HTO/transcripts/']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The June 30, 2025, Form 10-Q shows a balance sheet with a significant amount of debt, which is typical for a capital-intensive utility. While the company generates stable cash from operations, its large capital expenditure program often requires external financing. Historically, this has included a mix of debt and equity, including "at-the-market" (ATM) programs. While this financing is necessary for growth, it does create a recurring source of modest shareholder dilution. The need for external capital means meaningful dilution remains a potential risk.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000080/hto-20250630.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reviewing multiple earnings call transcripts, including for Q2 2025, shows a consistent pattern of communication from management. In the Q&A sessions, executives address analyst questions directly, including those about challenges like delays in rate cases, rising operating costs, and environmental issues. The "Risk Factors" section in the 10-K is detailed and specific. This demonstrates a willingness to discuss issues openly.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HTO/transcripts/', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section in the latest 10-K and 10-Q reveals no material lawsuits or government actions that would suggest a lack of integrity. There are no disclosed related-party transactions involving executive management that raise red flags. The company has a consistent record of compliance with regulatory and financial reporting standards.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000009/sjw-20241231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/766829/000076682925000080/hto-20250630.htm']

Synthesis:
H2O America scores well on the majority of Fisher's points, reflecting the stable and predictable nature of a well-run regulated water utility. Its strengths are a perpetual demand for its service, a clear path to growth through capital investment and rate cases, stable management, and transparent accounting. The primary weaknesses identified relate to points that do not fit the utility model (R&D, Sales) or reflect industry characteristics (need for external financing leading to some dilution risk). The score is unlikely to change dramatically in the next 12–24 months, but key variables to monitor would be the outcomes of pending regulatory rate cases and the company's ability to manage its capital program without a significant and unexpectedly dilutive equity issuance. A string of unfavorable regulatory decisions would flip the "Yes" on point 11, while evidence of rising employee disputes could change the "No" on point 7, though there is no current indication of either.

fisher score is 11 / 15
