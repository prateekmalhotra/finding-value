**3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In February 2025, DoorDash announced a share repurchase program of up to $5.0 billion. This program signals management's confidence in the company's long-term prospects and provides a mechanism to return capital to shareholders.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and return on equity (ROE). This can make the stock more attractive to investors and potentially lead to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** 0–12 months
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low:** The company repurchases $1.5 billion worth of shares over the next 12 months.
    *   **Base:** The company repurchases $2.5 billion worth of shares over the next 12 months.
    *   **High:** The company repurchases the full $5.0 billion worth of shares over the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–30%). A significant reduction in the number of outstanding shares could lead to a meaningful increase in EPS, which could in turn lead to a higher stock price.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has already announced the program and has a strong cash position.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must have sufficient cash flow to fund the repurchases without impacting its ability to invest in growth initiatives.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on the number of shares repurchased.
    *   Cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet.
    *   Free cash flow generation.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the company's business could force it to suspend the repurchase program.
    *   The company may choose to use its cash for acquisitions or other investments instead of repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the company's execution of the repurchase program and its impact on the stock price.

**4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**Catalyst Title:** International Market Expansion & Profitability
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** DoorDash is making significant investments in non-U.S. countries as part of its growth strategy. The company's acquisition of Wolt has accelerated its international expansion, and the company is now focused on achieving profitability in these new markets.
*   **Mechanism:** As the company scales its international operations, it can achieve greater economies of scale and improve its margins. This could lead to a significant increase in profitability and a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** 12–60 months
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low:** The company achieves profitability in one or two of its key international markets.
    *   **Base:** The company achieves profitability in a majority of its international markets.
    *   **High:** The company achieves profitability in all of its international markets and becomes the dominant player in several key regions.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). The international market represents a significant growth opportunity for DoorDash, and achieving profitability in these markets could lead to a substantial increase in the company's valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a strong track record of execution, but international expansion is complex and subject to a variety of risks.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must be able to successfully navigate the unique regulatory and competitive landscapes of each international market.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Revenue and profitability growth in international markets.
    *   Market share in key international markets.
    *   Number of international merchants and consumers.

**7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

*   **Share Repurchase Program:** A $2.5 billion share repurchase at an average price of $150 per share would reduce the number of outstanding shares by approximately 16.7 million. This would increase EPS by approximately 5%, which could lead to a 5-10% increase in the stock price.
*   **International Market Profitability:** If DoorDash can achieve a 5% net income margin on its international business, which is currently generating over $1 billion in revenue, this would add over $50 million to the company's net income. This could lead to a 10-20% increase in the stock price.
