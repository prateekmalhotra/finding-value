### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren's "Next Great Chapter: Accelerate" strategy identifies long-term growth vectors. These include expanding high-potential, under-penetrated categories like outerwear and home goods, and targeting geographic expansion, particularly in Asia. The company's Q4 2025 results showed a 13% constant currency sales growth in Asia, indicating traction in these growth markets. Management aims to build Ralph Lauren into a leading luxury lifestyle brand, suggesting a focus on moving upmarket and expanding the total addressable market beyond its current scope.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes its commitment to elevating the brand and investing in future growth. In the Q4 2025 earnings call, CEO Patrice Louvet highlighted investments in "new store concepts," "digital expansion," and "under-penetrated categories." The company's capital allocation priorities include investing in brand-accretive initiatives. The continued rollout of "World of Ralph Lauren" stores and digital flagships represents a process development to enhance the customer experience and drive sales.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an apparel and lifestyle company, Ralph Lauren does not report traditional R&D expenses. Instead, innovation is embedded in design, materials, and marketing. The company has invested in sustainability-focused innovations like its "Color on Demand" platform, which aims to reduce water usage in cotton dyeing. However, the company does not provide specific metrics to quantify the financial return or effectiveness of these efforts relative to its size or against competitors, making a direct assessment difficult.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is executing a strategic shift toward a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, which gives it greater control over brand presentation and customer relationships. For the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025, the DTC channel accounted for approximately 67% of total net revenues. This channel includes a global network of retail stores and digital commerce sites. The emphasis on "elevated" DTC experiences in key cities globally, combined with targeted digital marketing, constitutes a sophisticated and modern sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025, Ralph Lauren reported a gross profit margin of 66.8% and an adjusted operating margin of 13.9%. These margins reflect the company's premium positioning. The gross margin expanded by 160 basis points compared to the prior year, driven by lower freight costs and favorable product mix. This level of profitability is strong within the apparel industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement through several key initiatives. These include: elevating average unit retail (AUR) by reducing promotions and improving product mix, shifting towards higher-margin DTC channels, and maintaining disciplined inventory management. In the Q4 2025 earnings call, CFO Jane Nielsen noted that "quality of sale" initiatives and reduced air freight expenses contributed to a 100 basis point gross margin expansion in the quarter.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/RL/transcripts/ (May 23, 2025)']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's latest 10-K filing outlines its commitment to a "culture of belonging" and investments in its employees through compensation, benefits, and development programs. It highlights various Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion initiatives. There are no recent, widespread reports of significant labor disputes or unionization conflicts. The company's disclosures suggest stable and constructive personnel relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior leadership team, including CEO Patrice Louvet and founder Ralph Lauren (Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer), has been stable. Mr. Louvet has been CEO since 2017, providing consistent leadership for the "Next Great Chapter" strategy. The alignment between the founding visionary and the operating CEO appears strong, which is a crucial dynamic for a brand-led company.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations page and public filings name a team of seasoned executives beyond the CEO, including leaders for major regions (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia) and functions (e.g., CFO, Chief Commercial Officer). The continuity of the core executive team suggests a stable operating environment. However, formal succession plans beyond the CEO are not explicitly detailed in public filings, creating a potential key-person risk, particularly concerning the creative direction helmed by Mr. Lauren.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren provides detailed segment reporting for its three geographic regions (North America, Europe, Asia) and discloses revenues by distribution channel and product line. The auditor, Ernst & Young, LLP, has provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025. There is no recent history of material restatements or control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive clue in the luxury apparel industry is brand equity and the ability to command high average unit retail (AUR). Ralph Lauren's multi-year focus on elevating its brand and consistently increasing AUR—up 9% for fiscal 2025—is a strong indicator of its competitive strength. This pricing power, combined with disciplined control over its brand image through a growing DTC network, separates it from competitors that rely more heavily on the wholesale channel.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/RL/transcripts/ (May 23, 2025)']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's "Next Great Chapter: Accelerate" strategy is inherently long-term, focusing on brand elevation and strategic investments that may not maximize short-term profit. For example, reducing promotional activity and exiting lower-quality wholesale distribution initially constrained revenue but has built a healthier foundation for long-term, sustainable profitability and brand equity. This willingness to invest in marketing and new store concepts, even in uncertain macroeconomic environments, demonstrates a long-range view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company maintains a strong balance sheet and generates robust free cash flow. For the fiscal year ended March 29, 2025, the company generated $582 million in cash from operations. Its capital allocation strategy prioritizes organic investment and returning cash to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, not equity issuance. The company repurchased $400 million of its stock in fiscal 2025, signaling confidence and a commitment to preventing dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed quarterly earnings presentations and holds conference calls where they address both successes and challenges. In the Q4 2025 call, executives discussed softness in the North American wholesale channel openly, providing specific context and outlining their strategy to manage it. This level of transparency on both positive (e.g., Asia growth) and negative (e.g., North America wholesale) trends indicates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/RL/transcripts/ (May 23, 2025)']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent SEC filings and major news outlets reveals no significant scandals, regulatory actions, or material litigation related to executive misconduct. The company has a code of conduct, and its filings disclose related-party transactions in accordance with regulations. Governance structures appear standard for a publicly traded company of its size. There are no red flags to suggest a lack of integrity at the senior management level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm (March 29, 2025)']

Synthesis:
Ralph Lauren scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating the characteristics of a durable, high-quality business. The company's strongest attributes are its powerful brand equity, which enables strong and improving profit margins, a robust financial position that allows for consistent shareholder returns, and a clear long-term strategy. The primary negatives are a lack of specific R&D metrics common in the apparel industry and an absence of a publicly detailed succession plan for key executives. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two factors: the execution of its growth strategy in Asia, which is critical for the long-runway thesis, and the performance of the North American market, where persistent softness could challenge margin and sales targets. To flip the "No" on management depth, the company would need to provide more explicit details on its succession planning for senior creative and executive roles.

fisher score is 13 / 15
