### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** Chemed's businesses, hospice care (VITAS) and plumbing services (Roto-Rooter), do not exhibit meaningful network effects. The value of the service for a new customer does not increase with the number of existing customers. While the VITAS referral network could be interpreted as a weak form of a network effect, it is more accurately characterized as a distribution and intangible asset advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The business descriptions for VITAS and Roto-Rooter in the 2024 10-K do not indicate any network-based value proposition. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Switching costs are low for both VITAS and Roto-Rooter. For VITAS, patients can switch hospice providers once per benefit period, and while there may be emotional costs to changing providers during a vulnerable time, the financial and procedural barriers are not significant. For Roto-Rooter, customers can easily choose a different plumbing service for their next need with minimal friction.
**Evidence:**
*   The Medicare hospice benefit allows beneficiaries to change their designated hospice provider once in each benefit period. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Competition in the Roto-Rooter segment is described as "highly fragmented" with "local and regional firms providing the primary competition," indicating low barriers to customer switching. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** VITAS, as one of the nation's largest hospice providers, likely benefits from economies of scale in purchasing, back-office administration, and staffing, which could lead to a lower cost per patient day compared to smaller, local providers. Roto-Rooter's scale likely provides advantages in advertising, equipment purchasing, and technician training. However, the lack of explicit disclosure on per-unit cost advantages necessitates a conservative score.
**Evidence:**
*   VITAS is described as "one of the nation's largest providers of hospice services in an industry dominated primarily by small, community-based hospices." (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Roto-Rooter's national presence allows for advertising and brand recognition advantages that smaller competitors cannot easily replicate, suggesting a lower customer acquisition cost at scale. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** Chemed possesses strong intangible assets in the form of the highly-recognized Roto-Rooter brand and the VITAS trademarks. The Roto-Rooter brand, in use since 1935, is a significant asset in a fragmented market. VITAS's established reputation and relationships with referral sources are also valuable intangible assets.
**Evidence:**
*   "The Roto-Rooter marks are among the most highly recognized trademarks and service marks in the United States." (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   VITAS's success is "heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers," indicating the value of its established relationships and reputation. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** Both VITAS and Roto-Rooter have established dense networks in their operating regions that would be difficult and costly for a new entrant to replicate. VITAS's network of physicians, nurses, and volunteers, along with its relationships with healthcare facilities, creates an efficient scale advantage. Roto-Rooter's extensive network of company-owned locations and franchises provides significant geographic coverage.
**Evidence:**
*   VITAS provides services through a "network of physicians, registered nurses, home health aides, social workers, clergy and volunteers." (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Roto-Rooter provides services to residential and commercial customers through a combination of company-owned operations and independent franchises, creating a wide distribution network. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** While Chemed likely collects a significant amount of data through its operations, there is no evidence to suggest that this data provides a meaningful competitive advantage. The company does not disclose any data-driven products or services that create a feedback loop to improve its offerings and increase retention.
**Evidence:**
*   The 2024 10-K does not mention any data-driven competitive advantages or proprietary datasets. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** Chemed's businesses do not operate as ecosystems or platforms. There is no evidence of third-party developers, complementary product marketplaces, or significant integrations that would create a lock-in effect for customers.
**Evidence:**
*   The business descriptions for VITAS and Roto-Rooter in the 2024 10-K do not describe any platform or ecosystem characteristics. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The VITAS segment operates in a highly regulated industry. Some states have Certificate of Need (CON) laws that restrict the entry of new hospice providers, creating a significant barrier to entry in those markets. These CONs are valuable assets that protect VITAS from competition.
**Evidence:**
*   "Some states, including Florida and California, have Certificate of Need laws, restrictions on new licenses, or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers." (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   "In those states, we consider Certificates of Need valuable assets." (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** While not as capital-intensive as heavy manufacturing, both of Chemed's businesses require a certain level of specialized assets and infrastructure that would take time and capital to replicate. VITAS requires inpatient units and a network of trained medical professionals, while Roto-Rooter requires a fleet of specialized vehicles and equipment. The sunk costs and lead times to build such a network deter new entrants.
**Evidence:**
*   VITAS operates 29 inpatient units in 17 states and the District of Columbia. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Roto-Rooter has 402 leased and owned office and service facilities in 34 states. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** The VITAS segment has high revenue visibility due to its reliance on the Medicare program, which provides a steady stream of reimbursement on a per-diem basis. This provides a predictable revenue stream, although it is subject to regulatory changes. Roto-Rooter's revenue is more transactional and less predictable.
**Evidence:**
*   "Over 90% of VITAS' revenue is from the United States government through the Medicare program." (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (1 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (4 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.10 + 0.00 + 0.24 + 0.12 + 0.08 = 2.35

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 59.0 / 100

### Mapping
A weighted score of 59.0 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range, which maps to a moat rating of 3.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is 10-15 years. This is primarily supported by the strong, long-standing brand recognition of Roto-Rooter and the significant regulatory barriers in the hospice industry through Certificate of Need laws. These factors are not easily replicated and are likely to persist for the foreseeable future. However, the moat is not impenetrable, as regulatory changes in the healthcare sector could diminish the advantage provided by CON laws.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Regulatory Changes:** Deregulation of the hospice industry, particularly the repeal of Certificate of Need laws in key states, would significantly increase competition for VITAS. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
2.  **Brand Damage:** A significant negative event or series of events that damages the reputation of either the Roto-Rooter or VITAS brands could lead to a loss of customer trust and a decline in business. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
3.  **Reimbursement Risk:** A material reduction in Medicare reimbursement rates for hospice services would directly impact VITAS's profitability and could force changes to its service delivery model. (Chemed 2024 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **VITAS Average Daily Census:** A decline could indicate increased competition or reputational issues.
*   **VITAS Admissions:** A slowdown in admissions growth could signal a weakening of referral networks.
*   **Roto-Rooter Same-Store Revenue Growth:** A persistent decline would suggest erosion of brand strength or increased competition.
*   **Gross Margins by Segment:** A compression in margins could indicate pricing pressure from competitors.
*   **Changes in State-Level Certificate of Need Laws:** Any new legislation that weakens or repeals these laws would be a major red flag.
*   **Medicare Reimbursement Rate Updates:** Annual updates from CMS should be monitored closely for any adverse changes.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Chemed Corporation has a moderate economic moat, primarily derived from the strong brand recognition of its Roto-Rooter segment and the regulatory barriers that protect its VITAS hospice business. The company's scale in both segments provides some cost advantages, and the recurring revenue from Medicare in the VITAS segment offers a degree of predictability. However, the lack of significant switching costs and network effects limits the strength of the moat. The rating could be revised upwards if the company demonstrates a growing data advantage or if regulatory barriers become even stronger. Conversely, a weakening of the Roto-Rooter brand or the repeal of key Certificate of Need laws would justify a ratings downgrade.

moat rating is 3 / 5
