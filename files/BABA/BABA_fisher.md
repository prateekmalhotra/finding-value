**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba's core e-commerce business in China continues to grow, with Taobao and Tmall Group's customer management revenue up 12% year-over-year in the latest quarter. The key long-term growth drivers are now Cloud computing and international commerce. Alibaba Cloud's revenue growth accelerated to 18% in Q4 2025, driven by strong demand for AI products which have seen triple-digit growth for seven consecutive quarters. The international commerce segment (AIDC) also shows significant potential with revenue growing 22% year-over-year. These segments are tapping into the massive global markets for cloud services and e-commerce, which still have substantial room for growth.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba is heavily investing in artificial intelligence as a primary driver for future growth across its business units, particularly in Cloud. Management stated its commitment to an "AI-driven" strategy in its May 2025 earnings call. Evidence of this includes the rapid growth in AI-related product revenue for Alibaba Cloud and the open-sourcing of over 200 AI models. The company is also making significant investments in its e-commerce businesses to improve user experience and in its instant commerce business to drive user acquisition.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba's R&D is demonstrably effective in its cloud and AI segments. Revenue from AI-related products has maintained triple-digit year-over-year growth for seven consecutive quarters, indicating strong market adoption of its new technologies. The company has successfully developed and open-sourced over 200 models under its QN family, achieving over 300 million downloads worldwide, which enhances its leadership in AI. This shows a strong return on its R&D investments in the cloud and AI space.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's Taobao and Tmall Group saw a 12% year-over-year increase in customer management revenue, driven by improved take rates and software service fees. Furthermore, the 88VIP membership program surpassed 50 million members, indicating successful user retention and expansion efforts. In its cloud division, the consistent triple-digit growth of AI-related products points to a highly effective sales and marketing effort in the enterprise AI space.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, Alibaba reported a consolidated adjusted EBITDA increase of 36% to RMB32.6 billion. The non-GAAP net income was RMB29.8 billion, an increase of 22%. While the company is in an investment phase for certain businesses like instant commerce which pressures short-term EBITDA, its core businesses remain highly profitable and overall margins are substantial.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4692735-alibaba-group-baba-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4692735-alibaba-group-baba-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (May 15, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has highlighted improved operating efficiency as a key driver of margin improvement. This is evident in the 36% increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA, which was partly attributed to this factor. The company is also divesting non-core assets, such as Sun Art and Intime, to focus on higher-margin businesses. Revenue excluding these divested assets grew 10% year-over-year, faster than the consolidated 7% growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is insufficient recent, verifiable information from primary sources such as the 20-F or earnings calls to make a definitive judgment on the current state of Alibaba's labor and personnel relations. While the company's filings contain standard disclosures on human capital, they lack specific metrics on attrition or employee engagement. Without credible, recent evidence, this point cannot be confirmed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba underwent a significant management reshuffle in 2023, with Eddie Wu taking over as CEO of both Alibaba Group and the Cloud Intelligence Group. This change was part of a broader restructuring into six independent business groups. While the new structure is intended to unlock value, such major shifts can indicate instability. The long-term effectiveness of this new executive arrangement is not yet proven.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As part of its major restructuring, Alibaba appointed separate CEOs and boards for each of its six new business groups. This move demonstrates a commitment to empowering a wider group of leaders and suggests significant management depth below the main holding company level. Each business group CEO is a seasoned executive within their respective field.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba's Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, contains an unqualified audit opinion from PricewaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian LLP, indicating that the financial statements are fairly presented. The company provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for analysis of revenue and profitability by business unit. There have been no recent reports of material weaknesses in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba's key competitive advantage is its vast ecosystem, which creates powerful network effects. This ecosystem includes e-commerce (Taobao, Tmall), logistics (Cainiao), local services (Ele.me), and a leading cloud computing business. This integration allows for the collection of vast amounts of data, which in turn fuels its AI initiatives and provides a deeper understanding of consumer and business needs, a significant edge in both e-commerce and cloud services.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has explicitly stated they are in an "investment phase" for certain businesses, such as instant commerce, which may pressure EBITDA in the short term. The significant and sustained investment in AI and cloud infrastructure, despite a near-term decrease in free cash flow due to increased capital expenditures, also points to a focus on long-term growth over immediate profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://gurufocus.com/news/2422538/full-year-2025-alibaba-group-holding-ltd-earnings-call-transcript](https://gurufocus.com/news/2422538/full-year-2025-alibaba-group-holding-ltd-earnings-call-transcript) (May 15, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba has a very strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow. The company has a substantial share repurchase program, having bought back US$11.9 billion of its stock in fiscal year 2025. Additionally, the company announced a total cash dividend of US$2 per ADS. These actions demonstrate a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and indicate that the company has more than sufficient financial resources to fund its growth initiatives without dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q4 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed challenges, such as the 76% decrease in free cash flow and the reasons behind it (increased cloud infrastructure expenditure). They also acknowledged the investment phase in certain businesses will pressure short-term margins and highlighted potential uncertainties in global trade regulations. This willingness to discuss both positive and negative factors suggests a good level of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://gurufocus.com/news/2422538/full-year-2025-alibaba-group-holding-ltd-earnings-call-transcript](https://gurufocus.com/news/2422538/full-year-2025-alibaba-group-holding-ltd-earnings-call-transcript) (May 15, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Alibaba has faced significant regulatory scrutiny in China, including a major antitrust investigation that resulted in a substantial fine in 2021. The company's Variable Interest Entity (VIE) structure, while common for Chinese tech companies, presents inherent corporate governance risks for foreign investors. These major, unresolved regulatory and governance complexities prevent an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

---
**Synthesis:**
Alibaba scores well on factors within its direct control, such as its long-term growth potential in cloud and AI, R&D effectiveness, profitability, and financial strength. The company is clearly investing for the long term and maintains a strong balance sheet, allowing for significant shareholder returns via buybacks and dividends. However, the score is negatively impacted by external and organizational factors. The lack of verifiable data on labor relations and the recent major management restructuring introduce uncertainty. The most significant negative factor remains the overarching regulatory and corporate governance risks associated with operating in China, which directly impacts the integrity score. The Fisher score would most likely improve in the next 12-24 months if the new management structure proves to be stable and effective, and if there is a sustained period without new adverse regulatory actions from the Chinese government, which would begin to rebuild confidence in the company's governance.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
