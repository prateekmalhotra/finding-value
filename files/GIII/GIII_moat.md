### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** G-III’s business model is based on designing, sourcing, and marketing apparel, which does not create network effects. The value of its products does not increase for one user as more users purchase them. The company's success relies on brand appeal and distribution rather than a user network.
**Evidence:**
*   G-III is a global leader in fashion with expertise in design, sourcing, distribution and marketing, which enables it to fuel growth across a portfolio of over 30 globally recognized owned and licensed brands. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** G-III's customers (retailers) face low switching costs. While G-III has established relationships, retailers can and do switch to other suppliers based on brand performance, price, and consumer trends. The upcoming expiration of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses demonstrates that even significant, long-term relationships can be terminated.
**Evidence:**
*   The licenses for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger products expire on a staggered basis beginning on December 31, 2024 and continuing through December 31, 2027 (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
*   Sales to customers generally occur on an order-by-order basis that may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** G-III has a well-developed sourcing and supply chain infrastructure, with relationships built over 40 years. This provides some scale advantages and sourcing expertise. However, the company does not own its manufacturing facilities and is subject to the same input cost fluctuations as its competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   G-III's wholesale operations and retail operations segments arrange for the production of products from a global network of independent, third-party manufacturers, primarily located in Asia. During fiscal 2025, approximately 76% of our product was sourced from Vietnam, China and Indonesia. We do not own any manufacturing facilities. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
*   Our network of worldwide suppliers allows us to access the highest quality products, negotiate competitive terms without relying on any single vendor, access new technology and design insights and enhance our market intelligence. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** G-III's primary intangible assets are its portfolio of owned and licensed brands. The owned brands, particularly DKNY, Donna Karan, and Karl Lagerfeld, have global recognition. However, a significant portion of revenue is still derived from licensed brands, which have finite terms and are not owned by G-III.
**Evidence:**
*   Our owned brands accounted for approximately 52% of our net sales in fiscal 2025, 47% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and 41% of our net sales in fiscal 2023, with the remainder of net sales in each year driven by our licensed businesses (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
*   Sales of licensed products accounted for 48.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2025, 53.4% of our net sales in fiscal 2024 and 58.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2023 (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** G-III has a broad distribution network, selling to approximately 1,600 customers, including major department stores, specialty stores, and online retailers. This extensive network provides a scale advantage. However, the company is highly concentrated, with its top ten customers accounting for 69.6% of sales, making it vulnerable to shifts in their strategies.
**Evidence:**
*   Our products are sold to approximately 1,600 customers, including a cross section of retailers through their brick-and-mortar and digital channels as well as our online retail partners. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
*   Sales to our ten largest customers accounted for 69.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. Sales to Macy's...accounted for an aggregate of 18.0% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. Sales to TJX Companies accounted for an aggregate of 13.2% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. In addition, sales to Ross Stores accounted for an aggregate of 12.6% of our net sales in fiscal 2025. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** G-III utilizes data and analytics to understand customer behavior and inform product assortments. However, there is no evidence of a proprietary dataset that provides a significant and sustainable advantage over competitors, who also use similar data-driven approaches.
**Evidence:**
*   We utilize real-time data and analytics tools, enabling merchandisers to gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior that empowers our teams to quickly respond to changes in consumer preferences and continuously evolve product assortments to fuel growth (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** G-III's business model does not involve a platform or ecosystem that connects third-party developers or complementary product and service providers. The company operates a traditional wholesale and retail business.
**Evidence:**
*   G-III's business is focused on designing, sourcing, distributing, and marketing apparel and accessories. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The apparel industry is subject to customs, trade, and product safety regulations. While these regulations can be complex, they do not create significant barriers to entry for competitors. G-III does not hold any exclusive licenses or patents that would prevent competition.
**Evidence:**
*   Our arrangements with textile manufacturers and suppliers are subject to requisite customs clearances for products and the imposition of export duties. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** G-III's business is not highly capital-intensive, as it does not own its manufacturing facilities. This asset-light model reduces barriers to entry. However, the company does invest in its distribution centers and showrooms.
**Evidence:**
*   We do not own any manufacturing facilities. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
*   We lease our corporate offices and showrooms, which are located in New York City, New York...We also lease a distribution center which is located in Jamesburg, New Jersey. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** G-III's revenue visibility is limited. Sales are primarily on an order-by-order basis, and the business is seasonal. The company does not have long-term contracts with its retail customers, which limits revenue predictability.
**Evidence:**
*   Sales to customers generally occur on an order-by-order basis that may be subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
*   Retail sales of apparel have traditionally been seasonal in nature. Historically, our wholesale business has been dependent on our sales during our third and fourth fiscal quarters due to the anticipation of the holiday shopping season for our retail customers. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **Aggregation**

**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 1.27

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 12.7 / 100

### **Mapping**

A weighted score of 12.7 falls within the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1.

### **Moat Duration Justification**

The estimated moat duration is 3–5 years. This is primarily due to the impending expiration of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses, which will significantly impact revenues. The company's ability to offset these losses with its owned and other licensed brands will be a critical test of its competitive positioning.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**

1.  **Failure to Replace Licensed Revenue:** If G-III is unable to successfully scale its owned brands and new licensed brands to offset the loss of revenue from the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses, its financial performance could be severely impacted. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
2.  **Increased Customer Concentration Risk:** The loss of a major customer, such as Macy's or TJX, could have a material adverse effect on G-III's results of operations, given the high concentration of sales among its top customers. (G-III Apparel Group 10-K, March 24, 2025).
3.  **Shifts in Consumer Preferences:** A failure to anticipate and respond to changing fashion trends could lead to a decline in the appeal of G-III's owned and licensed brands, resulting in reduced sales and profitability.

### **KPIs to Monitor**

*   **Owned Brand Revenue Growth:** An increase indicates successful execution of the company's strategy to shift its revenue mix.
*   **Licensed Brand Revenue (excluding Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger):** Growth in this area is crucial for offsetting the loss of the expiring licenses.
*   **Gross Margin:** An increase would suggest pricing power and a successful shift to higher-margin owned brands.
*   **Customer Concentration:** A decrease in the percentage of sales from the top 10 customers would indicate a more diversified and less risky customer base.
*   **Inventory Turnover:** An increase would suggest strong demand and efficient inventory management.
*   **International Sales Growth:** An increase would demonstrate successful expansion into new markets.
*   **Retail Segment Profitability:** A return to profitability would indicate a successful turnaround of the company's retail operations.
*   **Net Sales:** Continued growth in net sales, despite the loss of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses, would be a strong indicator of the company's competitive strength.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**

G-III's moat is narrow and faces significant near-term challenges. The company's primary strengths lie in its brand portfolio and distribution network. However, the impending expiration of its key licenses with Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger represents a major threat to its revenue base. The high customer concentration also poses a significant risk. The company's future success will depend on its ability to successfully transition its revenue mix towards its owned brands and newly acquired licenses. A failure to do so could lead to a significant erosion of its competitive position.

moat rating is 1 / 5
