Lowe's Companies, Inc., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Q2 2025 Earnings Release, FY24 10-K, Q1 2025 10-Q.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's operates in the large and growing home improvement sector, which is estimated at $1 trillion. The market is highly fragmented, which presents a significant opportunity for market share growth. Lowe's is focused on growing its share with Pro customers, a key growth demographic, through tailored services and products. The company's recent acquisition of Artisan Design Group (ADG) is expected to further penetrate this market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's is actively investing in enhancing its capabilities. The company is investing in its online business, which saw 6% growth in Q1 2025. The acquisition of Artisan Design Group for $1.3 billion is a strategic move to grow in the professional contractor market. Additionally, the company is focused on improving its supply chain and inventory management to better serve customers and drive sales.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a retailer, Lowe's does not have traditional R&D in the same way a technology or pharmaceutical company would. Its investments are focused on improving the customer experience, supply chain, and e-commerce platform. The company's online sales grew 6% in Q1 2025, indicating that its investments in its online platform are paying off. However, the company does not disclose specific R&D spending, making a direct comparison to peers difficult.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's is focused on improving its sales organization by catering to both DIY and Pro customers. The company has a loyalty program and is making targeted efforts to grow its Pro business, which saw mid-single-digit growth in Q1 2025. The company also provides training to its employees to assist customers with their home improvement projects. However, without specific data on sales force productivity or market share gains against its primary competitor, it is difficult to definitively say its sales organization is "above-average."
**Answer:** No

**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's is focused on a disciplined approach to inventory management and supply chain efficiency to improve margins. The company is also focused on competitive pricing.

The company is also leveraging its scale to manage costs effectively.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's places a large focus on training its employees to provide advice to shoppers. However, there is not enough publicly available information on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations to make a definitive judgment on the quality of its labor relations. Without more concrete data, it is not possible to confirm that they are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://quartr.com/companies/LOW/investor-relations](https://quartr.com/companies/LOW/investor-relations)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no publicly available information to suggest any issues with executive relations at Lowe's. The company has a stable management team, and there have been no recent reports of significant executive turnover or disputes. However, without more specific information on the board's relationship with the executive team, a definitive "Yes" cannot be given.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's has a well-defined management team with experience in retail and home improvement. The company's investor relations website lists a team of executives with diverse backgrounds. However, the company does not provide detailed information on succession planning, making it difficult to assess the depth of its management bench fully.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's provides detailed financial reporting, including segment information, in its SEC filings. The company's independent auditor has not raised any concerns about its accounting practices or internal controls in recent years. There is no history of significant restatements, which suggests that the company has good accounting controls in place.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the home improvement industry, key competitive factors include store location, supply chain, and relationships with professional contractors. Lowe's operates over 1,700 stores across the United States. The company is making significant investments to attract and retain Pro customers. While Lowe's is a strong competitor, it is still second to The Home Depot in terms of market share, which suggests it is not "outstanding" relative to its main competitor.
**Answer:** No

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's has a balanced approach to short-term and long-term profits. The company provides annual guidance to investors and has a track record of meeting or exceeding its targets. At the same time, the company is investing in long-term growth initiatives, such as its acquisition of ADG and its focus on the Pro customer. The company's willingness to make significant acquisitions indicates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lowes-q2-2025-results-show-eps-beat-stock-up-3549214](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/lowes-q2-2025-results-show-eps-beat-stock-up-3549214), August 20, 2025.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's has a strong financial position. In the first half of fiscal 2025, the company generated $6.6 billion in free cash flow. The company uses its cash flow to invest in the business, pay dividends, and repurchase shares. Lowe's has a healthy balance sheet and does not need to issue new shares to fund its growth, thus avoiding dilution for existing shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lowe's management regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor conferences, and press releases. The company provides detailed information on its financial performance and outlook. Management's forward-looking statements and risk factor disclosures in their SEC filings provide transparency to investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/60667/000006066725000049/low-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/60667/000006066725000049/low-20250131.htm)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There have been no recent reports of major scandals or regulatory issues involving Lowe's management. The company has a code of conduct and ethics policy in place. Without any evidence to the contrary, it is reasonable to assume that the company's management has a high level of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

---
Synthesis:
Lowe's demonstrates strengths in its long-term growth potential within a large and fragmented market, its commitment to ongoing development through strategic acquisitions and online investments, and its strong financial position, which allows for growth without diluting shareholders. The company's profit margins are healthy and improving, and it maintains transparent communication with investors. The primary areas of weakness in this analysis stem from a lack of publicly available, concrete data to definitively assess the effectiveness of its sales organization, the quality of its labor and executive relations, and the depth of its management team. The Fisher score could improve in the next 12-24 months with increased market share in the Pro segment, successful integration of the Artisan Design Group acquisition leading to demonstrable earnings accretion, and more detailed disclosures regarding employee relations and management succession planning. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" if the company provides more transparency on these latter points, or if its market share gains versus its primary competitor become more pronounced.

fisher score is 9 / 15
