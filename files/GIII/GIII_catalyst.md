### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

---

#### **1. Catalyst Title: Growth of Owned Brands & Margin Expansion**

*   **Type:** Operational / Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is strategically pivoting from expiring Calvin Klein/Tommy Hilfiger licenses to its higher-margin owned brands (DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld). In fiscal 2025, a $188.4 million decrease in Calvin Klein/Tommy Hilfiger sales was more than offset by a $254.4 million increase in sales from DKNY, Donna Karan, and Karl Lagerfeld.
*   **Mechanism:** As higher-margin owned brands replace lower-margin licensed products, the company's consolidated gross and operating margins should expand. This margin accretion, combined with continued sales growth, will drive higher net income and EPS, leading to a potential re-rating of the stock.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing; next key readouts are Q2 and Q3 2026 earnings reports (expected ~September and ~December 2025).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Owned brands add $200M in new sales in fiscal 2026, but only just offset further declines in licensed revenue, leading to flat overall revenue. Assuming a 500 bps gross margin advantage on owned brands vs licensed, this mix shift could add ~$10M in gross profit.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Owned brands add $300M in new sales, leading to modest overall revenue growth. A 500-600 bps margin advantage adds ~$15M-$18M in incremental gross profit, driving operating margin expansion of 50-70 bps.
    *   **High Scenario:** Strong momentum in Donna Karan and international growth in Karl Lagerfeld adds over $400M in owned brand sales. This drives overall revenue growth of 5-7% and gross margin expansion of 100+ bps, leading to significant net income growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). Success in this transition is the core of the bull thesis and would demonstrate a sustainable post-PVH growth model.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has already demonstrated its ability to execute this strategy in fiscal 2025. The relaunch of Donna Karan has been successful, providing a new growth vector.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued consumer acceptance of DKNY and Donna Karan collections; successful international expansion of Karl Lagerfeld.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly sales figures for owned brands vs. licensed brands (from 10-Q/10-K filings).
    *   Gross margin percentage trends (10-Q/10-K).
    *   Management commentary on brand performance (Earnings calls).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A slowdown in consumer discretionary spending disproportionately impacts higher-priced owned brands.
    *   Fashion missteps in new collections for DKNY or Donna Karan could slow momentum.
    *   Licensed revenue declines faster than owned brands can ramp up.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is the most critical factor for the company's future. Positive data points in the next two quarters would be a strong buy signal.

---

#### **2. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program Execution**

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a significant share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. As of April 30, 2025, 6,982,731 shares remained available for repurchase under the program.
*   **Mechanism:** Active share repurchases reduce the number of shares outstanding, directly increasing Earnings Per Share (EPS). This provides a direct valuation lift and signals management's confidence that the stock is undervalued.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing (0-12 months). The company repurchased 807,437 shares in Q1 fiscal 2026 (the three months ended April 30, 2025).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   As of June 3, 2025, there were 43,305,811 shares outstanding.
    *   The remaining authorization of 6,982,731 shares represents **16.1%** of the outstanding shares.
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases 1 million shares (~2.3% of float) over the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases 3 million shares (~6.9% of float), providing a similar boost to EPS.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company aggressively executes the full remaining authorization, repurchasing ~7 million shares and reducing the share count by over 16%. This would provide a substantial boost to EPS.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). A fully executed buyback would be a significant driver of shareholder return, especially at current valuation levels.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, as evidenced by the Q1 fiscal 2026 activity. Management has the authorization and financial capacity (over $181 million in cash as of Jan 31, 2025, and strong operating cash flow) to continue.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Stock price remaining at levels management deems attractive; no major acquisitions that would require capital preservation.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports (10-Q) showing "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
    *   Cash flow statements showing cash used for "Purchase of treasury shares."
    *   Updates to the number of shares outstanding.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A sudden need to preserve cash for operational reasons could pause the buyback.
    *   A rapid run-up in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   The company could choose to prioritize a large acquisition over share repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The repurchase program provides a strong floor and a clear mechanism for capital return, supported by recent insider buying.

---

#### **3. Catalyst Title: Insider Buying Signal**

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Two insiders, a Director and an Executive Vice President, made significant open-market purchases of GIII stock in June 2025. Director Victor Herrero Amigo purchased 5,000 shares for approximately $110k, and EVP Jeffrey David Goldfarb purchased 23,076 shares for approximately $492k.
*   **Mechanism:** Insider purchases signal that the company's leadership believes the stock is undervalued and that future prospects are strong. This can attract other investors and increase market confidence, leading to a higher share price.
*   **Timing:** Immediate (0-3 months). The signal has already been sent to the market.
*   **Quantification:** The total value of the purchases in June 2025 was over $600,000. While not a massive sum, it is a clear positive signal against a backdrop of general market uncertainty.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (0-10%). While a positive indicator, insider buys alone are rarely a major catalyst unless they are exceptionally large or widespread. However, they strongly corroborate the other bullish catalysts.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 100%. The purchases are factual and have been filed with the SEC.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The signal is most effective if not followed by subsequent insider selling (excluding planned sales) in the near term.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Form 4 filings on SEC EDGAR or services like OpenInsider.
    *   Changes in insider ownership levels in proxy statements.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The CEO, Morris Goldfarb, had a significant sale in September 2024, though this is now somewhat dated.
    *   The positive signal could be negated if the company reports poor quarterly results.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This reinforces the positive investment case, suggesting that those with the most information are confident in the company's strategy.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

---

#### **1. Catalyst Title: International Expansion via AWWG Partnership**

*   **Type:** Partnership / M&A
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** G-III acquired an 18.7% stake in AWWG, a global fashion group, to serve as a platform to accelerate the international growth of its owned brands. AWWG is now the agent for DKNY, Donna Karan, and Karl Lagerfeld in Spain and Portugal, with plans for further European expansion.
*   **Mechanism:** This partnership provides G-III with an established operational infrastructure and local market expertise in Europe, allowing for a capital-efficient and accelerated rollout of its brands. Success would create a significant new revenue stream outside of North America, diversifying the business and driving long-term growth.
*   **Timing:** 12–36 months. Initial results from Spain/Portugal should become visible in the next 12-18 months, with broader expansion to follow.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   In fiscal 2025, G-III generated ~$719 million (23% of total) in sales outside the U.S.
    *   **Low Scenario:** The AWWG partnership adds $100M in annual revenue over 3 years.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The partnership successfully establishes the brands in key European markets, adding $250M-$350M in annual revenue over 3-5 years. This could add $0.25-$0.40 to EPS, assuming a 6-7% net margin.
    *   **High Scenario:** The partnership model proves highly effective, leading to an expansion into additional markets and adding over $500M in annual revenue, significantly diversifying G-III's geographic footprint.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). Successfully establishing a major European business would fundamentally change the growth profile and valuation of the company.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The strategy is sound and the partner is well-established. However, international expansion carries inherent execution risk and will take time to show material results.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful integration and collaboration with AWWG's management; European consumer acceptance of G-III's brand offerings.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Management commentary on international performance and the AWWG partnership (Earnings calls).
    *   Net sales breakdown by geography in annual reports (10-K).
    *   Announcements of expansion into new European countries.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Economic weakness in Europe could mute consumer demand.
    *   Cultural differences or execution missteps could derail the partnership.
    *   The brands may not resonate with European consumers as well as expected.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a key long-term value driver. Look for initial signs of success in management commentary over the next 4-6 quarters.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

#### **Catalyst 1: Share Repurchase Impact on EPS**
This example estimates the potential EPS accretion from executing the remaining share repurchase authorization.
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Shares Outstanding (as of June 3, 2025): 43,305,811
    *   Remaining Share Repurchase Authorization: 6,982,731 shares
    *   Net Income Attributable to G-III (Fiscal 2025): $193.57 million
*   **Baseline Calculation (Pre-Repurchase):**
    *   Fiscal 2025 Diluted EPS = $193.57M / 46.116M shares = $4.20
*   **Scenario (Full Repurchase Execution):**
    *   New Share Count = 43,305,811 - 6,982,731 = 36,323,080 shares
    *   **Pro-Forma EPS** = $193.57M / 36.323M shares = **$5.33**
*   **Valuation Impact:**
    *   The repurchase alone could drive a **26.9%** increase in EPS. Applying the same P/E multiple would imply a similar increase in the share price. If the market rewards the more efficient capital structure with a higher multiple, the impact could be greater.

#### **Catalyst 2: Margin Expansion from Brand Mix Shift**
This example shows the potential impact on net income from shifting revenue from licensed to owned brands.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Assume $400M of licensed revenue (from expiring brands) is replaced by $400M of owned brand revenue.
    *   Assume a conservative 500 basis point (5%) improvement in gross margin on the owned brand revenue (due to no royalty payments).
    *   Tax Rate: 28.4% (Fiscal 2025 effective tax rate)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Incremental Gross Profit = $400,000,000 * 5.0% = $20,000,000
    *   Incremental Pre-Tax Income = $20,000,000 (assuming SG&A is roughly flat for the replaced revenue)
    *   **Incremental Net Income** = $20,000,000 * (1 - 0.284) = **$14,320,000**
*   **Valuation Impact:**
    *   This represents a **7.4%** increase to fiscal 2025 net income ($14.32M / $193.57M). This incremental, high-quality recurring income could drive a valuation increase of 10-15% as the market gains confidence in the new, more profitable business model.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts appears positive. The primary headwind—the expiration of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses—is well-known and appears to be priced into the stock. The positive drivers, including strong momentum in the owned-brand portfolio, a significant and active share repurchase program, and recent insider purchases, provide a strong counter-narrative. The market signal is cautiously bullish; while the revenue transition creates uncertainty, management is executing its mitigation strategy effectively and insiders are voting with their wallets, suggesting confidence in a successful outcome over the next 0-12 months.

### **9) Evidence Matrix**

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Revenue Cliff:** The decline in revenue from the expiring Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses accelerates beyond the company's ability to replace it with new and owned brands, causing a sharp, multi-quarter drop in total revenue and profitability.
2.  **Severe Consumer Recession:** A significant downturn in the global economy, particularly in North America, leads to a sharp contraction in consumer discretionary spending on apparel, undermining growth across both owned and licensed brand portfolios.
3.  **Fashion Miss:** The relaunched Donna Karan brand or new collections from DKNY fail to resonate with consumers, causing the primary engine of growth to stall and leading to significant inventory markdowns and margin pressure.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

G-III Apparel presents a compelling catalyst-driven investment case centered on a strategic transformation that is already demonstrating success. The primary catalyst is the profitable growth of its owned brands (DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld), which is on track to more than offset the well-publicized expiration of key licenses. This operational pivot, combined with an aggressive share repurchase program that could retire over 16% of the company's stock and recent bullish insider buying, creates a favorable risk/reward profile with a potential upside range of 20-40% over the next 12-18 months. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly gross margin percentage, as its expansion will be the clearest evidence that the company's transition to a higher-quality, more profitable business model is succeeding.
