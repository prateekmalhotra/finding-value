**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear is a mature company in a mature industry. While the global tire market is expected to grow, the pace is slow. The company's sales have been relatively flat over the past decade. However, Goodyear is focusing on high-value-added segments of the market, such as large-rim-diameter tires, electric vehicle (EV) tires, and intelligent tires, which have higher growth potential. The company’s "Goodyear Forward" plan is targeting over $2 billion in annualized cost reductions by the end of 2025.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue is in line with its major competitors, such as Michelin and Bridgestone.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear has a strong global distribution network that includes a mix of wholesale and retail channels. The company has a strong brand reputation and a loyal customer base.

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear's profit margins have been under pressure in recent years due to rising raw material costs, increased competition, and restructuring charges.

The company's "Goodyear Forward" plan is aimed at improving profitability, but it is too early to say whether it will be successful.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear has a long history of unionization in the United States and other countries. The company has experienced labor disputes and strikes in the past.

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been some recent turnover in Goodyear's executive ranks. In 2024, the company appointed a new CEO and CFO.

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The tire industry is highly competitive and capital-intensive. Success in this industry depends on scale, technology, brand reputation, and distribution. Goodyear is one of the largest tire manufacturers in the world and has a strong brand and global distribution network. The company is also a leader in tire technology, which gives it a competitive advantage.

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear's management is focused on the long-term success of the company. The "Goodyear Forward" plan is a multi-year initiative that is designed to improve the company's profitability and competitiveness over the long term, even if it means sacrificing some short-term gains.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Goodyear has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations. The company has a manageable level of debt and has access to the capital markets if needed. The company has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. It is unlikely that the company will need to issue a significant amount of new equity in the foreseeable future.

Synthesis:
Goodyear is a well-established company with a strong brand and global presence. However, the company is facing significant challenges, including slow growth in its core markets, intense competition, and rising costs. The "Goodyear Forward" restructuring plan is a bold move to address these challenges, but its success is not guaranteed. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of the "Goodyear Forward" plan, a significant improvement in profit margins, and a stabilization of the company's market share. A "No" on "Products/Services with Long Runway" could be flipped to a "Yes" if the company can demonstrate sustained growth in its EV and intelligent tire businesses. A "No" on "Worthwhile Profit Margins" would turn to a "Yes" with a consistent upward trend in operating margins toward the industry average.
