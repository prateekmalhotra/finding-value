### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pool Corporation is the world's largest wholesale distributor of swimming pool supplies and equipment. The market is supported by a large and aging installed base of approximately 5.4 million in-ground pools in the U.S. alone, which require non-discretionary maintenance and repair, accounting for roughly 65% of sales in 2024. The company sees long-term growth from favorable demographic trends, such as population migration to warmer climates and increased homeowner investment in outdoor living spaces. Management also highlights growth opportunities in remodeling, upgrading to new technologies like automation and energy-efficient equipment, and expanding into adjacent product categories like irrigation and landscape products.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** POOL's development focus is on enhancing its distribution capabilities and customer-facing technology rather than manufacturing R&D. The company is making ongoing investments in its "digital transformation and technology," specifically the POOL360 digital ecosystem, a suite of SaaS products for pool professionals that includes water testing and business management tools (CRM, routing, billing). This strategy aims to create capacity for customers, improve operational efficiency, and drive market share gains. Furthermore, the company consistently expands its network by opening 8-10 new sales centers annually and making strategic acquisitions to penetrate new markets and product categories.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a wholesale distributor, Pool Corporation does not have a traditional R&D function focused on creating new manufactured goods; this is the responsibility of its suppliers like Pentair and Hayward. The company does not disclose a specific R&D expense line item in its financial statements. Its innovation investments are directed towards technology platforms (POOL360), digital marketing tools (NPT Backyard app), and operational efficiencies like warehouse management. While these investments are critical to its strategy, they are not comparable to the R&D efforts of manufacturing or technology companies, making a direct assessment of "R&D effectiveness" in Fisher's sense difficult.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** POOL's sales organization is its primary asset and competitive advantage. The company operates the industry's largest network with 448 sales centers globally as of December 31, 2024, serving approximately 125,000 wholesale customers. This scale provides significant advantages in product availability, geographic proximity to customers, and logistics. The company supports its customers with comprehensive programs including in-depth product training, marketing support via its EDGE Marketing Portal, and business development training. The ability to consistently gain market share in a fragmented industry is strong evidence of an above-average sales and distribution network.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Pool Corporation reported a gross profit margin of 29.7% and an operating margin of 11.6%. While gross margins declined slightly from 30.0% in 2023 and 31.3% in 2022, they remain substantial for a distribution business. The operating margin of 11.6% demonstrates strong profitability even after accounting for significant selling and administrative expenses related to its large network. These margins have consistently enabled high returns on capital and significant cash flow generation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on maintaining and improving margins through several initiatives. These include pricing optimization efforts, promoting higher-margin private-label and exclusive brand products, and earning volume-related purchase incentives from vendors. The company also focuses on "capacity creation," which involves using technology like its POOL360 and BlueStreak platforms to improve operational efficiency and manage variable costs. For 2025, the company projects gross margins to be in line with its long-term target of around 30.0%.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pool Corporation states its goal is to be an "Employer of Choice" by focusing on employee engagement, development, and well-being. The company emphasizes its commitment to safety, talent management, and competitive compensation and benefits. As of December 31, 2024, none of its approximately 6,000 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the company states that it believes it has "good relations with our employees." It offers an entry-level Manager in Training (MIT) program to build its leadership pipeline. Without access to internal metrics like employee turnover or engagement scores, this assessment relies on the company's public disclosures, which are positive.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is evidence of stability and alignment within the executive team. The company's compensation programs, including annual cash bonuses and share-based awards, are designed to align executive incentives with performance metrics like operating income and earnings growth. The company's proxy statement (incorporated by reference in the 10-K) details these programs. The long tenure of key executives and a history of orderly succession planning suggest stable and effective executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pool Corporation has a formal Manager in Training (MIT) program designed to "prepare Manager Trainees for sales and operations management opportunities and build our pipeline for field leadership." This program indicates a structured approach to developing management talent from within the organization. The company also emphasizes succession planning in its human capital disclosures. The decentralized nature of its 448 sales centers necessitates a deep bench of local and regional managers to run operations effectively.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pool Corporation's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion on its financial statements from its independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP. Furthermore, the auditor's report on internal control over financial reporting, also unqualified, states that the company "maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024." Management's own report concurs with this assessment. The company has not reported any material weaknesses or a history of restatements, indicating robust accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** POOL's key competitive advantage is the scale and density of its distribution network in a fragmented industry. With 448 sales centers, it can offer a breadth of inventory (over 200,000 SKUs) with a level of local availability that smaller regional and local distributors cannot match. This creates a moat through logistical efficiency and customer convenience. The company also leverages its scale to obtain favorable purchasing terms from suppliers, which it can then pass on to its 125,000 customers, creating a value proposition that is difficult for competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary consistently emphasizes long-term growth opportunities driven by secular trends in housing and outdoor living. The company makes consistent, long-term investments in technology (digital platforms), network expansion (new sales centers and acquisitions), and employee training (MIT program) that may pressure short-term margins but are designed to secure future market share and profitability. Despite a softer macroeconomic environment in 2024 that impacted discretionary product sales, the company continued its expansion and investment plans, prioritizing long-term strategic positioning over short-term profit maximization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong history of funding its growth through operating cash flow and debt, not equity issuance. In 2024, POOL generated $659.2 million in cash from operations. This cash was used to fund $306.3 million in share repurchases, $179.6 million in dividends, a $103.0 million debt reduction, and $64.2 million in capital expenditures and acquisitions. The company's consistent share repurchase programs demonstrate a commitment to returning capital and reducing share count, the opposite of dilutive equity financing. Its balance sheet and access to credit facilities are robust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion in the 2024 10-K and recent earnings calls openly addresses the challenges facing the business. They clearly state that sales of discretionary products for new pool construction and remodeling were "softer, impacted by macroeconomic conditions" and that "new in-ground pool construction units decreased 15%." They also discuss margin pressures from carrying higher-cost inventory. This transparency about negative trends, combined with detailed explanations of their strategic responses, demonstrates a high degree of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/POOL/transcripts/2025/2/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/POOL/transcripts/2025/2/) (July 24, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags that would question the integrity of management. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K states that while the company is subject to various claims in the ordinary course of business, it does not believe any will have a material adverse impact. The company has a formal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, officers, and directors. The consistent, unqualified audit opinions and effective internal controls also provide positive evidence supporting management's integrity in financial reporting.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/945841/000094584125000032/pool-20241231.htm) (Filed February 27, 2025)

Synthesis: Pool Corporation scores very highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its dominant market position, strong operational execution, and shareholder-friendly capital allocation. The company's primary strengths are its unparalleled distribution network, which provides a durable competitive advantage, and its large base of non-discretionary, recurring revenue from pool maintenance. The main negative, if any, is its lack of a traditional R&D function, which is inherent to its business model as a distributor. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the macroeconomic environment; a sustained period of high interest rates and low consumer confidence could continue to depress the high-margin new construction and remodel segments, potentially pressuring margins and growth. Conversely, a rebound in the housing market and discretionary spending would flip the current sales decline into renewed growth, solidifying its high score.

fisher score is 14 / 15
