V.F. Corporation, August 24, 2025, analysis based on Q4 Fiscal Year 2025 results (ended March 29, 2025), Q1 Fiscal Year 2026 results (ended June 28, 2025) and related news analysis.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** V.F. Corporation's portfolio includes strong growth brands like The North Face and Timberland, which grew 2% and 10% respectively in Q4 FY2025. However, the company's overall performance is severely hampered by its largest brand, Vans, which experienced a 22% revenue decline in the same period. Total company revenue was down 5% in Q4 FY2025, and analysts forecast revenue to remain stagnant over the next 12 months, citing headwinds and a challenging turnaround. While a new CEO is implementing a turnaround strategy, the current trajectory and the deep decline in a core brand do not support the likelihood of a sizable increase in total sales in the near future.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The current CEO, Bracken Darrell, has a stated focus on revitalization through innovation. This is a core pillar of the "Reinvent" transformation strategy, which aims to fix and turnaround the struggling Vans brand, in part by focusing on new product development. Early signs of product innovation at Vans are noted as a potential catalyst for recovery. The company's stated priorities include leveraging new products and services to improve top-line performance.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific, verifiable data in recent reports or financial filings detailing V.F. Corp's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue or comparing its effectiveness to peers. While management speaks of innovation, the severe sales decline in the Vans brand, which accounts for a significant portion of revenue, suggests that recent product development and R&D efforts have not been effective in maintaining market share or driving growth. The lack of specific metrics on R&D output and the poor performance of a key brand lead to a negative conclusion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHFfXuqdgXpCgjVlZMvyG1l5-NW0sGH2IKnhMs_EHrgVbVoUsscTun7hm_7GP4ZP929uF65tt6bOgSPblHTVA-aeFXIgwngMNNVRuJJV3oJOtvhFbhxblPGct5LgLjox37cbVxyjw516CaKui_m3uT7eM7TsPmJrAqtpEGrblS6Z_7Nq_xtHD9ezVtBsN5MW_pP_d0nk6BcQjo=] (October 17, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales results have been negative, with consolidated revenue declining for the past two years. In Q4 FY2025, sales were down across all major channels and regions: Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) declined 5%, wholesale was down 4%, the Americas region was down 6%, and EMEA was down 4%. This broad-based decline, especially the deterioration in the wholesale channel, indicates significant challenges in the sales organization's effectiveness and ability to manage its retail partnerships and consumer-facing channels. The ongoing effort to "fix the US business" is a direct admission of current shortcomings.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHr-NmVczjnrA6TUaAb1dMWR2gLapXD19FKd7Z4gxxIvDq-KDsauagSEA-TzyyN7HgQuE_1YSrGrSml13D3BaZtFRK2Klt1cRoCQeiw2lLj0HCS-XlEdAxi5Kkwp4Q7jxA0MHXByMtytGr11SaveQ4iQ3lWayTgt4ovyPNyarBsJq9xN9lV2c6IQlmCFTzXoymuj1HzUkaRhZ0i8CX_rA==] (July 30, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1Cd_Xn9IJHksSKnUQoS1ZiMx57aMB34mrWuCZ1JouozZFgtjHqkktcHkKw-q0M_my1Nty6JrRfzv2Oe5iuv_GlFf4U_q-5vH8ZkqEKsaT4T0I3L-NPXLo6dSApSoUGjxlKB5c2DTQhYkYmATyW1m2Q-RG2o7je-6xHEfAxJdxgu0FuzL9gp-YpcCGh2EmL27-BVrLjCb-gurvQF6_1k7PtjnydQCtfrcfANCdw-BoP7jTndMx_G8VBwfgzHa_t5Q=] (May 21, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** V.F. Corp's profitability is under severe pressure. The company reported a negative operating margin of -4.9% in Q2 CY2025 (Q1 FY2026), alongside a non-GAAP loss per share of -$0.24. While adjusted gross margin has shown some improvement, rising to 54.1% in Q1'26, this has not translated into operating profitability. Over the last five years, EPS has declined by an average of 15.9% annually, indicating a persistent profitability problem.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHr-NmVczjnrA6TUaAb1dMWR2gLapXD19FKd7Z4gxxIvDq-KDsauagSEA-TzyyN7HgQuE_1YSrGrSml13D3BaZtFRK2Klt1cRoCQeiw2lLj0HCS-XlEdAxi5Kkwp4Q7jxA0MHXByMtytGr11SaveQ4iQ3lWayTgt4ovyPNyarBsJq9xN9lV2c6IQlmCFTzXoymuj1HzUkaRhZ0i8CX_rA==] (July 30, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is executing a significant cost-saving program with a target of $300 million in fixed cost reductions. In Q4 FY2025, the company reported a 560 basis point improvement in adjusted gross margin, attributed to better inventory quality and reduced promotional activity. The turnaround plan explicitly targets margin expansion as a key outcome, alongside deleveraging the balance sheet and improving operational efficiency. These actions demonstrate a clear focus on improving profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** No specific information on labor relations, employee turnover, or union activities was found in the recent financial reports or news analysis. Without verifiable evidence regarding the state of personnel relations, it is not possible to determine if they are "outstanding." Therefore, the answer must be no.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant leadership changes, with Bracken Darrell taking over as CEO in July 2023 to lead a turnaround. A new CFO, Paul Vogel, was appointed in Q4 FY2024. This level of recent turnover at the highest executive levels, while necessary for the turnaround, does not align with Fisher's preference for stable, long-tenured executive teams. The success of the current team and their long-term stability are not yet established.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.gurufocus.com/news/2513970/vf-corporation-vfc-eyes-future-growth-with-strategic-changes] (April 4, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the new CEO and CFO, V.F. Corp has appointed new leadership for the critical Vans brand. The company's investor relations materials list a full executive team, including a Chief Commercial Officer and Global Brand Presidents for its major brands like The North Face. This structure suggests a layer of experienced leadership below the C-suite, providing operational depth across its portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no mentions of material weaknesses, restatements, or auditor issues in the reviewed sources. The company provides segment reporting for its major brands, indicating a degree of granular cost and revenue tracking. A major focus of the current turnaround plan is a $300 million cost reduction program, which would require detailed cost analysis to execute effectively. This suggests that the company has the necessary controls and analysis capabilities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHFfXuqdgXpCgjVlZMvyG1l5-NW0sGH2IKnhMs_EHrgVbVoUsscTun7hm_7GP4ZP929uF65tt6bOgSPblHTVA-aeFXIgwngMNNVRuJJV3oJOtvhFbhxblPGct5LgLjox37cbVxyjw516CaKui_m3uT7eM7TsPmJrAqtpEGrblS6Z_7Nq_xtHD9ezVtBsN5MW_pP_d0nk6BcQjo=] (October 17, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the apparel industry, brand equity is the most critical competitive advantage. V.F. Corp's portfolio contains globally recognized brands like The North Face, Vans, and Timberland. However, the sharp and sustained decline of Vans demonstrates that this brand equity is fragile and has been recently mismanaged. While The North Face shows resilience, the severe underperformance of Vans, a culturally significant brand, is a major negative clue about the company's ability to maintain its competitive standing.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHFfXuqdgXpCgjVlZMvyG1l5-NW0sGH2IKnhMs_EHrgVbVoUsscTun7hm_7GP4ZP929uF65tt6bOgSPblHTVA-aeFXIgwngMNNVRuJJV3oJOtvhFbhxblPGct5LgLjox37cbVxyjw516CaKui_m3uT7eM7TsPmJrAqtpEGrblS6Z_7Nq_xtHD9ezVtBsN5MW_pP_d0nk6BcQjo=] (October 17, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "Reinvent" strategy is inherently a long-range plan. Management is undertaking significant operational changes—fixing brands, cutting costs, and reducing debt—that are causing near-term pain, including revenue declines from rationalizing wholesale channels. They have set a long-term leverage target of 2.5x by FY'28. This willingness to accept poor near-term results while executing a multi-year turnaround plan is a clear indication of a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF1Cd_Xn9IJHksSKnUQoS1ZiMx57aMB34mrWuCZ1JouozZFgtjHqkktcHkKw-q0M_my1Nty6JrRfzv2Oe5iuv_GlFf4U_q-5vH8ZkqEKsaT4T0I3L-NPXLo6dSApSoUGjxlKB5c2DTQhYkYmATyW1m2Q-RG2o7je-6xHEfAxJdxgu0FuzL9gp-YpcCGh2EmL27-BVrLjCb-gurvQF6_1k7PtjnydQCtfrcfANCdw-BoP7jTndMx_G8VBwfgzHa_t5Q=] (May 21, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** V.F. Corp is highly focused on strengthening its balance sheet and has made significant progress. Net debt was reduced by $1.8 billion in FY2025, lowering the leverage ratio to 4.1x. The company forecasts generating approximately $600 million in free cash flow in FY2025 and is using asset sales (such as the sale of Supreme) to pay down debt rather than issuing equity. This clear deleveraging strategy, funded by cash flow and divestitures, makes dilutive equity financing unlikely.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent communications have occurred during a period of significant trouble. Management has been open about the challenges, particularly the poor performance of Vans and the need for a comprehensive turnaround. President and CEO Bracken Darrell has publicly acknowledged the issues and detailed the four key priorities of the "Reinvent" strategy. While this candor is happening during a crisis, a pending securities lawsuit alleges that the company failed to meet analyst and investor expectations in its Q4 FY2025 results, pointing to a potential lack of transparency regarding the extent of the problems at Vans. This lawsuit introduces doubt about their consistency of candor.
**Answer:** No

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A securities litigation firm is investigating V.F. Corp concerning possible violations of federal securities laws following the Q4 FY2025 results announcement on May 21, 2025. The investigation centers on the company's failure to meet expectations, particularly regarding the steep decline in the Vans brand. The existence of such an investigation, regardless of the ultimate outcome, means that integrity cannot be considered "unquestionable" at this time.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
V.F. Corporation's current Fisher score reflects a company in the midst of a significant and challenging turnaround. The strongest positives are a new management team with a clear, long-term strategy focused on cost savings, balance sheet repair, and brand innovation. The company's financial discipline is a key strength, as it is actively reducing debt through free cash flow and asset sales, avoiding shareholder dilution. The primary negatives are rooted in poor operational performance, namely declining sales, negative profit margins, and the severe deterioration of its largest brand, Vans. The score is unlikely to improve in the next 12-24 months until the Vans turnaround gains credible traction, demonstrated by several consecutive quarters of stabilizing and then growing sales. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on key points like "Long Runway" and "Above-Average Sales Organization" would require concrete evidence of sustained, positive, consolidated revenue growth. Furthermore, a favorable resolution of the pending securities litigation would be necessary to change the scores for integrity and candor.

fisher score is 6 / 15
