### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Pesquería Mill Expansion Ramp-Up

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Ternium is in the process of a major expansion at its industrial center in Pesquería, Mexico. Capital expenditures for this project amounted to $810 million in the second quarter of 2025 alone.
*   **Mechanism:** The successful ramp-up of the new facilities will increase production capacity, enhance product mix toward higher-margin steel products, and improve operational efficiency, leading to higher revenue and profitability. This should, in turn, increase earnings per share and justify a higher stock valuation.
*   **Timing:** The ramp-up is ongoing and expected to contribute progressively over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Minor delays in ramp-up, leading to a 5% increase in run-rate EBITDA.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Successful ramp-up leading to a 10% increase in run-rate EBITDA.
    *   **High Scenario:** Faster than expected ramp-up and market absorption, resulting in a 15% increase in run-rate EBITDA.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%. A significant increase in production capacity and efficiency should lead to a material re-rating of the stock's valuation multiples.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The project is already in its advanced stages, with significant capital already deployed.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful and timely commissioning of the new facilities, and market demand to absorb the new capacity.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on capital expenditures, production volumes, and product mix.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Construction delays, operational issues during ramp-up, or a downturn in regional steel demand.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor quarterly earnings reports for updates on the project's progress.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Shareholder Returns Program (Dividends)

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Ternium has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends. In the second quarter of 2025, the company paid a dividend of $353 million.
*   **Mechanism:** Consistent and growing dividend payments can attract income-focused investors, increasing demand for the stock and supporting a higher valuation. It also signals management's confidence in the company's financial health.
*   **Timing:** Dividend announcements are typically made on an annual basis.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Dividend is maintained at the current level.
    *   **Base Scenario:** A 5-10% increase in the annual dividend, in line with earnings growth.
    *   **High Scenario:** A special dividend is declared on top of a regular increase, driven by strong cash flow.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%. While dividends are a positive signal, their impact on the share price is likely to be less dramatic than a major operational catalyst.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a consistent track record of dividend payments.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a stable to positive business outlook.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Annual and quarterly earnings announcements, specifically the board's decision on dividend payments.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in the steel market could lead to a reduction in the dividend.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The dividend provides a solid return for investors.

**3. Catalyst Title:** EBITDA Margin Improvement

*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Ternium's Adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 10% in Q2 2025, and the company expects further improvement in Q3 2025, driven by cost reduction initiatives.
*   **Mechanism:** Higher EBITDA margins translate directly to higher profitability and cash flow, which can lead to a higher stock price through increased earnings and a potential re-rating of valuation multiples.
*   **Timing:** The next 3-6 months, with Q3 2025 results being the next major data point.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** EBITDA margin remains flat at 10%.
    *   **Base Scenario:** EBITDA margin improves to 11-12% in the second half of 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** EBITDA margin exceeds 12%, driven by a combination of cost cuts and favorable pricing.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-15%. A sustained improvement in profitability would be a significant positive for the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. Management has explicitly guided for an improvement in the third quarter.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful implementation of cost-cutting measures and a stable steel pricing environment.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly financial results, specifically Adjusted EBITDA and EBITDA margin.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A sharp drop in steel prices or an unexpected increase in input costs could negate the impact of cost-cutting efforts.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The near-term outlook for margin improvement is a strong positive.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Decarbonization and Investment in Low-Carbon Steelmaking

*   **Type:** Operational/Strategic
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Ternium is investing in low-carbon emissions steelmaking technologies to support the energy transition.
*   **Mechanism:** As the world moves towards a greener economy, companies with a clear and credible decarbonization strategy are likely to attract a premium valuation. This can also open up new markets and customer segments for Ternium's products.
*   **Timing:** This is a multi-year effort, with progress expected to be reported in annual sustainability reports.
*   **Quantification:** This is difficult to quantify precisely, but it could lead to a 10-20% valuation premium over time compared to less environmentally-friendly competitors.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has publicly committed to this strategy.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful development and implementation of new technologies, and a supportive regulatory environment.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Annual sustainability reports, announcements of new investments in green technologies.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** The cost of new technologies could be higher than expected, or the transition could be slower than anticipated.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a long-term story that will unfold over several years.

*   **Current Market Cap (approx.):** $6.27B
*   **Potential Price Impact:** $806M / $6.27B = **~12.9%**

**2. EBITDA Margin Improvement:**

*   **Assumption:** EBITDA margin improves from 10% to 12%.
*   **Q2 2025 Revenue:** $3.947B
*   **Current Q2 EBITDA:** $403M
*   **EBITDA at 12% margin:** $3.947B * 12% = $473.6M
*   **Incremental Quarterly EBITDA:** $473.6M - $403M = $70.6M
*   **Annualized Incremental EBITDA:** $70.6M * 4 = $282.4M
*   **Enterprise Value Impact (assuming a 5x EV/EBITDA multiple):** $282.4M * 5 = $1.412B
