### B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION

Direct quantitative forward-looking guidance from the most recent earnings call (Q2 2025) was not accessible for this analysis. As per the valuation framework, the forecast will proceed based on a blend of historical performance and stated assumptions.

### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

**1. Revenue Growth:**
*   **Assumption:** Revenue will grow at a rate of **13.5%** annually for the next five years.
*   **Rationale:** No direct guidance was available. The 3-year revenue CAGR from FY 2022 ($22,237M) to TTM June 2025 ($30,241M) is approximately 13.5%. This historical rate reflects strong recent performance and is used as a realistic base-case projection. (Calculation: (($30,241 / $22,237)^(1/3)) - 1).

**2. Margin Path (Operating Margin):**
*   **Assumption:** Operating Margin will remain stable at **58.3%**.
*   **Rationale:** The average operating margin over the last three fiscal years (2022, 2023, 2024) was 57.05%, 57.96%, and 58.41% respectively, with a TTM margin of 58.73%. An average of ~58.3% is a reasonable and conservative assumption in the absence of specific management guidance on margin expansion initiatives.

**3. Taxes:**
*   **Assumption:** The effective tax rate will be **17.0%**.
*   **Rationale:** The average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years was 15.36% (2022), 17.92% (2023), and 15.60% (2024). The TTM rate is 17.46%. A normalized rate of 17.0% is a balanced assumption.

**4. Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** Assumed at **1.5% of revenue**, based on the 3-year historical average.
*   **Stock-Based Comp. (SBC):** Assumed at **1.6% of revenue**, based on the 3-year historical average.
*   **Working Capital:** Assumed at **1.0% of incremental revenue**, reflecting historical patterns of efficient working capital management.

**5. Diluted Share Count:**
*   **Assumption:** The diluted weighted-average share count remains at **916 million**.

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

*   **Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD, Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $34,324 | $38,958 | $44,217 | $50,186 | $57,001 |
| EBIT (58.3%) | $20,011 | $22,713 | $25,780 | $29,260 | $33,232 |
| NOPAT | $16,609 | $18,872 | $21,397 | $24,286 | $27,582 |
| (+) D&A | $1,311 | $1,489 | $1,690 | $1,918 | $2,179 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $549 | $623 | $708 | $803 | $912 |
| (-) Capex | $515 | $584 | $663 | $753 | $855 |
| (-) Chg. in NWC | $41 | $46 | $53 | $60 | $68 |
| **FCFF** | **$16,815** | **$19,108** | **$21,663** | **$24,588** | **$27,926** |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

**1. Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Formula:** Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.29%** (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield on Aug 20, 2025).
*   **Beta:** **1.03** (Source: Zacks, 5-Year Monthly Beta). This reflects a company with volatility slightly higher than the overall market, consistent with a market-leading but economically sensitive business.
*   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.0%**. This is a standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 1.03 * 5.0% = 9.44%**

**2. Cost of Debt:**
*   **Formula:** Interest Expense / Total Debt = $720M / $18,970M = **3.79%**.
*   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 3.79% * (1 - 17.0%) = 3.15%**

**3. WACC Calculation:**
*   **Market Cap (E):** $535.79 Billion (Source: Stock Analysis, Aug 20, 2025).
*   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $18.97 Billion.
*   **Formula:** WACC = (E / (E+D)) * CoE + (D / (E+D)) * CoD * (1-T)
*   **WACC = (535.8 / 554.8) * 9.44% + (19.0 / 554.8) * 3.15% = 9.11% + 0.11% = 9.22%**

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

**1. Gordon Growth Method:**
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This rate is a reasonable long-term assumption, reflecting long-run inflation expectations and the growth of the global economy.
*   **Formula:** Terminal Value = FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
*   **Terminal Value = $27,926 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.0922 - 0.025) = $28,624 / 0.0672 = $425,952 Million**

**2. Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   **Year 5 EBITDA =** EBIT Year 5 + D&A Year 5 = $33,232M + $2,179M = $35,411M
*   **Median EV/EBITDA Multiple:** **29.2x** (Source: Finbox, 5-year median).
*   **Terminal Value (Multiple) = $35,411M * 29.2 = $1,033,901 Million**
*   **Decision:** There is a significant discrepancy. As instructed, the lower, more conservative value from the Gordon Growth method will be used for the base case.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($16,815/1.0922¹) + ... + ($27,926/1.0922⁵) = $15,396 + $16,000 + $16,569 + $17,099 + $17,908 = **$82,972 Million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $425,952 / (1.0922)⁵ = **$272,997 Million**
*   **Enterprise Value (EV) = $82,972 + $272,997 = $355,969 Million**
*   **Equity Value =** EV - Net Debt
*   **Net Debt =** Total Debt ($18,970M) - Cash ($9,031M) = $9,939 Million.
*   **Equity Value = $355,969M - $9,939M = $346,030 Million**

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value =** Equity Value / Diluted Shares
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $346,030 / 916 = $377.76 per share**

**Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case:** **$378**. (Assumes 13.5% revenue growth and 58.3% operating margin).
*   **Low/Bear Case:** **$315**. (Assumes a more pessimistic scenario with 11% revenue growth and margin compression to 56%).
*   **High/Bull Case:** **$450**. (Assumes a more optimistic scenario with 15% revenue growth and slight margin expansion to 59%).

**Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 25% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer for potential errors in assumptions or unforeseen risks.
*   **MOS Price = $377.76 * (1 - 0.25) = $283.32**

### Risk Notes

1.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a dominant player in the payments duopoly, Mastercard faces continuous antitrust and regulatory pressure globally regarding its fee structures, which could impact future profitability.
2.  **Competition:** The rise of fintech, "Buy Now, Pay Later" (BNPL) services, and alternative payment networks (including blockchain-based systems) poses a long-term threat to Mastercard's market share and pricing power.
3.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** Mastercard's revenue is directly tied to the volume of consumer and business transactions. A global economic downturn, reduced consumer spending, or a decline in cross-border travel would negatively affect its growth prospects.
4.  **Cybersecurity and Data Privacy:** The company's operations depend on the secure and uninterrupted functioning of its global payment network. Any significant data breach could result in financial losses, reputational damage, and increased regulatory oversight.
