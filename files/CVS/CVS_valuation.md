### C) Forecast & Assumptions

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Y1: 5.0%, Y2: 4.5%, Y3: 4.0%, Y4: 3.5%, Y5: 3.0% | Based on management's 2025 guidance implying ~5.6% growth, blended with recent TTM growth of 6.2%. A conservative declining growth path is assumed due to the law of large numbers. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 2.5% (flat) | No explicit guidance provided. Set slightly above the TTM margin of 2.43% to reflect modest recovery, but held flat due to "continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure." |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 25.5% | No explicit guidance. Based on the 3-year average effective tax rate (2022-2024) of 25.46%, normalizing for a high TTM rate. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 0.80% | No explicit guidance. Based on the 3-year average (2022-TTM) as a percentage of revenue. |
| **∆ in NWC as % of ∆ in Rev**| 1.0% | Based on a normalized rate due to high historical volatility. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 0.14% | Based on the TTM Stock-Based Compensation as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (Figures in millions) | **Year 1 (2026)** | **Year 2 (2027)** | **Year 3 (2028)** | **Year 4 (2029)** | **Year 5 (2030)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $403,545 | $421,705 | $438,573 | $454,123 | $467,747 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *5.0%* | *4.5%* | *4.0%* | *3.5%* | *3.0%* |
| EBIT | $10,089 | $10,543 | $10,964 | $11,353 | $11,694 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *2.5%* | *2.5%* | *2.5%* | *2.5%* | *2.5%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT \* (1-Tax)) | $7,516 | $7,854 | $8,168 | $8,458 | $8,712 |
| (+) D&A | $4,843 | $5,060 | $5,263 | $5,449 | $5,613 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $565 | $590 | $614 | $636 | $655 |
| (-) Capex | $3,228 | $3,374 | $3,509 | $3,633 | $3,742 |
| (-) ∆ in NWC | $192 | $182 | $169 | $155 | $136 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$8,374** | **$8,768** | **$9,139** | **$9,483** | **$9,792** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

| Component | Value | Calculation & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **7.40%** | `Risk-Free Rate + Beta * ERP` |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.30% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 20, 2025). |
| Equity Beta | 0.62 | 5-Year Monthly Beta reflects a mature, low-volatility healthcare firm. (Finviz, August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP)| 5.00% | Standard assumption for the U.S. market. |
| **After-Tax Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **2.76%** | `(Interest Expense / Total Debt) * (1 - Tax Rate)` |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 3.70% | ($3,058M / $82,724M). |
| **WACC** | **5.17%** | `(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd)` |
| Market Cap of Equity (E)| $90,000M | Approximate market capitalization. |
| Value of Debt (D) | $82,724M | Book value of total debt. |
| Weight of Equity (E/V) | 52.1% | $90,000 / ($90,000 + $82,724) |
| Weight of Debt (D/V) | 47.9% | $82,724 / ($90,000 + $82,724) |

### F) Terminal Value

The Gordon Growth Model is used to calculate the terminal value, with a conservative growth rate capped at long-run inflation expectations.

*   **Terminal FCFF (Year 6):** $9,792M * (1 + 2.25%) = $10,012M
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.25% (Justification: A realistic proxy for long-term U.S. inflation.)
*   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = Terminal FCFF / (WACC - g)`
*   **Calculation:** `$10,012M / (5.17% - 2.25%) = $10,012M / 2.92% = $342,877M`

**Cross-Check (Exit Multiple Method):**
*   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $11,694M + $5,613M = $17,307M
*   Historical Median EV/EBITDA for CVS is ~7.0x - 9.0x. Using a conservative 8.0x multiple:
*   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $17,307M * 8.0 = $138,456M
*   **Conclusion:** There is a significant discrepancy. The Exit Multiple method results in a much lower valuation, suggesting the market assigns a lower long-term growth/profitability profile than the Gordon Growth model with these inputs. As per the instructions, the more conservative (lower) terminal value is chosen.
*   **Selected Terminal Value:** **$138,456M**

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   `($8,374/1.0517^1) + ($8,768/1.0517^2) + ($9,139/1.0517^3) + ($9,483/1.0517^4) + ($9,792/1.0517^5)`
    *   `$7,962 + $7,931 + $7,838 + $7,748 + $7,605 = $39,084M`
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** `$138,456M / (1.0517^5) = $107,351M`
*   **Enterprise Value:** `$39,084M (PV of FCFF) + $107,351M (PV of TV) = $146,435M`
*   **Equity Value Calculation:**
    *   `Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash & Equivalents`
    *   `$146,435M - $82,724M + $11,787M = $75,498M`

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value / Diluted Weighted-Average Shares`
    *   **Calculation:** `$75,498M / 1,264M = $59.73`
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $59.73:** Assumes 5.0% initial revenue growth declining to 3.0%, stable 2.5% EBIT margins, and an 8.0x exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$45:** Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 2-3%), margin compression to ~2.0% from reimbursement pressure, and a lower exit multiple (e.g., 7.0x).
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$75:** Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 6-7%) from successful cost-saving synergies and market share gains, modest margin expansion to ~3.0%, and a higher exit multiple (e.g., 9.0x).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **Discount:** 25% below Base-Case Fair Value.
    *   **MOS Price:** `$59.73 * (1 - 0.25) = $44.80`

### Risk Notes

1.  **Margin Pressure:** The business, particularly in the pharmacy and PBM segments, faces persistent reimbursement pressure from government and commercial payers, which could further compress profitability.
2.  **Integration Risk:** Successful integration and synergy realization from recent large acquisitions (like Oak Street Health and Signify Health) are critical to future growth and are not guaranteed.
3.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** As a major player across the healthcare landscape, CVS is exposed to significant regulatory risk, including potential changes to drug pricing, Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement, and antitrust enforcement.
4.  **Competitive Intensity:** The company faces intense competition from other integrated healthcare players, PBMs, and mass-market retailers entering the pharmacy and healthcare services space.
5.  **Debt Load:** The company maintains a significant debt balance, which could constrain financial flexibility and increase risk in a rising interest rate environment.

final answer is 59.73 $
