Kinsale Capital Group, Inc., August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC Filings, Earnings Call Transcripts.

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale operates in the excess and surplus (E&S) lines insurance market, which is characterized by risks that the standard insurance market is unwilling to cover. This market has grown faster than the broader property and casualty market, and Kinsale has consistently grown its premiums at a rate far exceeding the E&S market's overall growth. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Kinsale grew gross written premiums by 25.1%, demonstrating continued strong demand for its specialized products. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1669162/000166916225000043/knsl-20250630.htm] The company's strategy of focusing on small, hard-to-place accounts provides a long runway for growth, as this segment is less attractive to larger competitors.
**Answer:** Yes

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale has a history of expanding its product lines and actively entering new markets. The company's proprietary technology platform is a key element of its strategy, enabling it to efficiently underwrite a high volume of small-premium policies. Management regularly discusses its focus on innovation and leveraging its technology to gain a competitive advantage. For example, in its Q2 2025 earnings call, the company highlighted its ability to quickly adapt to market changes and develop new products in response to emerging risks.

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an insurance company, Kinsale's R&D is not comparable to that of a technology or pharmaceutical company. However, its investment in its proprietary technology platform serves a similar purpose, enabling it to develop and price new products efficiently. The company's consistently low expense ratio compared to its peers is a testament to the effectiveness of its technology-driven approach. While the company does not disclose specific R&D spending, its superior underwriting margins and growth suggest that its investment in technology and product development is highly effective.
**Answer:** Yes

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale distributes its products exclusively through a network of independent insurance brokers. The company's success is therefore dependent on its ability to build and maintain strong relationships with these brokers. The company's rapid and consistent premium growth suggests that its sales and marketing efforts are highly effective. The company's focus on a select group of brokers allows it to provide a high level of service and expertise, which helps to drive business to Kinsale.
**Answer:** Yes

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale consistently generates industry-leading profit margins. The company's combined ratio, a key measure of underwriting profitability in the insurance industry, was 76.4% in 2024, which is significantly better than the industry average. For the first six months of 2025, the combined ratio was 79.7%, which, while higher than the prior year, is still indicative of strong profitability. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1669162/000166916225000043/knsl-20250630.htm] The company's focus on disciplined underwriting and its low-cost operating model are the primary drivers of its superior margins.

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale's management team is highly focused on maintaining the company's strong profit margins. The company's proprietary technology platform is a key driver of its low expense ratio, and the company continues to invest in technology to improve efficiency.

The company's annual reports and other filings do not provide specific metrics on employee turnover or satisfaction.

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Kinsale's senior leadership team is experienced and has a long tenure with the company, there is limited public information available about the depth of management below the executive level. The company's filings do not provide details on succession planning or the experience of non-executive managers. This lack of information makes it difficult to assess the company's management depth.

**Citations:** []

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale's focus on the E&S market provides it with several competitive advantages. This market is characterized by higher premiums and lower loss ratios than the standard insurance market, which allows Kinsale to generate superior returns. In addition, the company's proprietary technology platform gives it a significant advantage over its competitors, who often rely on outdated and inefficient systems. This allows Kinsale to underwrite business more quickly and efficiently, and to provide a higher level of service to its brokers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1669162/000166916225000010/knsl-20241231.htm']

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale's management team has consistently stated that its primary goal is to generate long-term value for shareholders. The company's focus on disciplined underwriting, even at the expense of short-term premium growth, is a testament to its long-term perspective. The company's willingness to invest in its technology platform, which has a long-term payoff, is further evidence of its focus on the future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/KNSL/transcripts/']

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale has a strong balance sheet and a history of generating strong cash flow. The company's low dividend payout ratio and its modest debt levels provide it with ample financial flexibility to fund its growth initiatives. The company has not issued any equity to fund its operations in recent years, and it is unlikely to need to do so in the foreseeable future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1669162/000166916225000043/knsl-20250630.htm']

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Kinsale's management team has a reputation for being transparent and straightforward with investors. The company's quarterly earnings calls are detailed and informative, and management is willing to answer tough questions from analysts. The company's filings are also clear and comprehensive, and provide a good overview of the company's business and financial performance.

Synthesis:
Kinsale Capital Group scores highly on the Philip A. Fisher analysis, with its primary strengths being its focus on a profitable niche market, its proprietary technology platform, and its disciplined underwriting approach. These factors have enabled the company to generate industry-leading growth and profitability. The primary areas of uncertainty are related to the company's labor and personnel relations and the depth of its management team, as there is limited public information available on these topics. A significant change in the E&S market, such as increased competition or a change in the regulatory landscape, could negatively impact the company's growth and profitability. Conversely, continued market share gains and the successful launch of new products could lead to a further increase in the company's stock price.

fisher score is 13 / 15
