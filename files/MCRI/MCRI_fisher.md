Monarch Casino & Resort, Inc., August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 10-K, Q2 2025 10-Q.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Monarch operates in two distinct, capacity-constrained markets: Reno, Nevada, and Black Hawk, Colorado. The recently completed expansion in Black Hawk transformed the property into a full-scale resort, attracting higher-value customers who previously might have traveled to Las Vegas. The Black Hawk/Central City gaming market generated approximately $810 million in gaming revenues for the twelve months ending December 31, 2024. Additionally, the removal of betting limits in Black Hawk in May 2021 provides a long-term tailwind for growth. In Reno, the company owns 16 acres of undeveloped land adjacent to its Atlantis property, offering significant future development potential.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Monarch has a consistent history of investing in its properties to enhance their market position. The company invested $43.9 million in capital expenditures in 2024 and $51.4 million in 2023. Recent major projects include the complete redesign and upgrade of all hotel rooms at the Atlantis and the transformation of the Monarch Black Hawk property. Management explicitly states its strategy to "continuously upgrade and maintain our facilities in order to present a fresh, high quality product to our guests." The company is also exploring online sports betting, having secured a Master License in Colorado.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a casino operator, Monarch does not have formal R&D in the traditional sense. Its "R&D" is represented by capital projects and property enhancements. The company's recent expansion in Black Hawk, completed in early 2022, has been effective, positioning the property as a market leader and driving revenue growth. The effectiveness of its capital deployment is evident in its high returns on investment and market share gains in the competitive Black Hawk market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's marketing efforts are directed at three primary groups: leisure travelers, conventioneers, and local residents. In Reno, the Atlantis is the only hotel-casino physically connected to the Reno-Sparks Convention Center, providing a distinct competitive advantage. The company's cross-property "Monarch Rewards" loyalty program is a key tool for tracking player patterns, building loyalty, and driving repeat visits. The success of these strategies is reflected in the steady growth of casino, hotel, and food and beverage revenues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Monarch consistently achieves strong profit margins. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported income from operations of $92.5 million on net revenues of $522.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of 17.7%. While this is a decrease from previous years, it is still a strong indicator of profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management emphasizes a hands-on style focused on "customer service and cost efficiencies." The completion of the Black Hawk expansion allows for greater operating leverage. Additionally, the company is focused on attracting higher-value players, which typically yields higher margins. The company also implemented a new hotel management system, which is a cloud computing arrangement that can lead to operational efficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Monarch employed approximately 2,900 people. The company states that its management focus is on employee retention and that it offers competitive benefits, leadership development workshops, and tuition reimbursement of up to $6,000 annually. However, the 2024 10-K also notes that "the tight employment environment has created labor challenges, including wage inflation, which we are actively managing". Without more specific data on employee turnover or satisfaction, and given the disclosed labor challenges, a definitive "Yes" is not supported.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has been led by the Farahi family for decades, with John Farahi as CEO and Bob Farahi as President. This long tenure suggests a stable and cohesive leadership team. As of December 31, 2024, the Farahi family beneficially owned approximately 32% of the company's outstanding common stock, indicating strong alignment between management and shareholder interests.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the Co-Chairmen, John and Bob Farahi, are central to the company's strategy and have a long, successful track record, the 10-K identifies them as "key personnel." The loss of their services is listed as a risk factor, stating that if the company "cannot replace such persons in a timely manner with competent and experienced personnel, our business could be materially adversely affected." This "key person" risk suggests a potential lack of publicly disclosed management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's report on internal control over financial reporting also concluded that their controls were effective. There is no history of material restatements or serious accounting issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Monarch's key competitive advantages are the quality of its assets and their strategic locations. In Black Hawk, its resort is the first one visitors encounter from Denver and is positioned as the premier, high-end destination in a market with significant barriers to entry. In Reno, the Atlantis' direct connection to the convention center and its location in the more affluent south Reno area are distinct advantages. The company's long-term ownership and continuous reinvestment in these single assets have created properties that are difficult to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s history of significant, multi-year capital investment projects, such as the major expansion of the Monarch Black Hawk, demonstrates a long-range outlook. Management was willing to endure the disruption and expense of a multi-year construction project for the sake of long-term market leadership and profitability. The company did not pay a dividend until 2023, instead retaining cash flow to reinvest in the business and pay down debt, further evidencing a focus on long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, the company had $58.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding balance on its $100 million credit facility. The company has historically funded its capital expenditures through operating cash flow and debt, not equity issuance. The company also has a stock repurchase plan in place, under which it can purchase up to 1,950,040 shares, signaling confidence in its financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed discussions of its operations, market conditions, and challenges in its SEC filings. The 2024 10-K openly discusses competitive pressures, labor challenges, and the risks associated with its business. The company has also been transparent about its ongoing litigation with the general contractor for the Black Hawk expansion, providing regular updates on the proceedings. However, the lack of transcripts for earnings calls makes it difficult to assess real-time candor in a Q&A setting.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/MCRI/transcripts/'] (August 24, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is subject to extensive regulation by gaming authorities in Nevada and Colorado, which conduct thorough background checks on officers, directors, and key employees. There is no evidence of major legal or regulatory issues beyond the civil dispute with their construction contractor. The company discloses related-party transactions with entities controlled by the Farahi family, primarily for property leases, which are detailed in the 10-K. While these transactions are transparent, their existence prevents a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity without further scrutiny.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/907242/000155837025002045/mcri-20241231x10k.htm'] (February 27, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Monarch Casino & Resort scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating particular strength in its long-term growth potential, commitment to reinvestment, and strong financial health. The company's core positives are its premier, well-located assets in supply-constrained markets and its history of disciplined capital allocation for growth. The primary negatives and areas of concern revolve around a high dependence on key family executives, which raises questions about management depth and succession planning. The score could change in the next 12-24 months based on a few key variables. A successful resolution or appeal of the PCL construction litigation would remove a significant financial overhang. Increased transparency, such as hosting and transcribing quarterly earnings calls, would flip the "Candor with Investors" point to a "Yes." Finally, any concrete announcements regarding the development of the 16-acre parcel in Reno would provide a clearer roadmap for the company's next phase of growth.

**Fisher score is 11 / 15**
