### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

The following assumptions form the base-case forecast for 2025 through 2029.

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025): 9.5%**. This is based on ~4.5% unit growth from new stores plus ~5.0% comparable sales growth, in line with recent performance and management commentary. (Analyst Estimate)
    *   **Years 2-5:** Growth rate decays by 1.0% per year to **5.5%** in Year 5, reflecting the law of large numbers and market maturation. (Analyst Estimate)
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT): 9.0%** (Stable). This is a conservative estimate slightly below the FY2024 margin of 9.6% to account for guided inflation in commodities (5%) and labor (4%). (Analyst Estimate)
*   **Tax Rate: 15.5%**. The midpoint of management's guided range of 15% to 16%. (10-K, Feb 28, 2025, p. 45)
*   **Capital Expenditures:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025): $400 million**, per management guidance. (10-K, Feb 28, 2025, p. 47)
    *   **Years 2-5: 6.8% of Revenue**, based on the 3-year historical average (2022-2024). (Calculation from 10-K data)
*   **Depreciation & Amortization: 3.3% of Revenue**, in line with the stable historical average. (10-K, Feb 28, 2025, p. F-5)
*   **Stock-Based Compensation: 0.88% of Revenue**, in line with the stable historical average. (Calculation from 10-K data)
*   **Change in Working Capital:** Modeled as **-5.8% of the change in revenue**, reflecting the company's efficient negative working capital model where growth generates cash. (Calculation from 10-K data)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flows available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Change in NWC

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**

| Year | 2025 (Y1) | 2026 (Y2) | 2027 (Y3) | 2028 (Y4) | 2029 (Y5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,883.8 | $6,384.8 | $6,865.7 | $7,312.3 | $7,714.5 |
| EBIT (9.0%) | $529.5 | $574.6 | $617.9 | $658.1 | $694.3 |
| NOPAT (EBIT*(1-T)) | $447.5 | $485.5 | $522.1 | $556.1 | $586.7 |
| (+) D&A | $194.2 | $210.7 | $226.6 | $241.3 | $254.6 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | ($51.8) | ($56.2) | ($60.4) | ($64.3) | ($67.9) |
| (-) Capex | ($400.0) | ($434.2) | ($466.9) | ($497.2) | ($524.6) |
| (-) Change in NWC | $30.8 | $29.1 | $27.9 | $26.5 | $23.3 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$219.7** | **$234.9** | **$249.3** | **$262.4** | **$272.1** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (Ke): 8.69%**
    *   **Formula:** Ke = Risk-Free Rate + (Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.29%** (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Beta:** **0.88** (5-Year Beta). This reflects lower volatility than the broader market, which is typical for a stable consumer defensive company. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.0%**. A standard assumption for the U.S. market. (Analyst Estimate)
    *   *Calculation: 4.29% + (0.88 * 5.0%) = 8.69%*
*   **Cost of Debt (Kd): 4.62% (after-tax)**
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt:** **5.47%**. Based on the interest rate on the company's credit facility. (10-K, Feb 28, 2025, p. 47)
    *   **Tax Rate:** 15.5%
    *   *Calculation: 5.47% * (1 - 0.155) = 4.62%*
*   **WACC: 8.41%**
    *   **Formula:** WACC = (Ke * We) + (Kd, after-tax * Wd)
    *   **Market Value of Equity:** $11,550 million. (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025)
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $857 million. (10-K / StockAnalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025)
    *   **Weight of Equity (We):** 93.1%
    *   **Weight of Debt (Wd):** 6.9%
    *   *Calculation: (8.69% * 0.931) + (4.62% * 0.069) = 8.41%*

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = FCFF(Year 5) * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5%**. This is a reasonable long-term growth assumption, in line with long-run inflation expectations and sustainable economic growth. (Analyst Estimate)
    *   **Terminal Value Calculation:** ($272.1 * 1.025) / (8.41% - 2.5%) = $278.9 / 0.0591 = **$4,719.1 million**.
    *   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $4,719.1 / (1 + 0.0841)^5 = **$3,156.4 million**.
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   A historical median EV/EBITDA multiple for TXRH is typically in the 10-14x range. Using a conservative **12.0x** multiple.
    *   **EBITDA (Year 5):** EBIT ($694.3M) + D&A ($254.6M) = $948.9M
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple):** 12.0 * $948.9M = **$11,386.8 million**.
    *   **Result:** There is a significant discrepancy. The Gordon Growth method implies an exit multiple of ~$4,719.1M / $948.9M = ~5.0x EBITDA, which is very low. The Exit Multiple method appears more realistic given historical precedent. However, following the instruction to be conservative, I will use the **lower Gordon Growth value**. This choice implies a significant reversion to the mean for the company's valuation multiple.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   *Calculation:* ($219.7/1.0841^1) + ($234.9/1.0841^2) + ($249.3/1.0841^3) + ($262.4/1.0841^4) + ($272.1/1.0841^5) = $985.3 million
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   **Formula:** EV = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value
    *   *Calculation:* $985.3 million + $3,156.4 million = **$4,141.7 million**.
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt
    *   **Net Debt:** Total Debt ($857.2M) - Cash ($245.2M) = $612.0 million (10-K, Feb 28, 2025, p. F-4)
    *   *Calculation:* $4,141.7 million - $612.0 million = **$3,529.7 million**.

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding
    *   *Calculation:* $3,529.7 million / 67.011 million shares = **$52.67 per share**.
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$52.67**.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$40**. Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 6-7% in Year 1 fading to 3%) and margin compression to 8.0% due to persistent inflation, resulting in a lower valuation.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$75**. Assumes stronger comparable sales growth (e.g., 12% in Year 1) and margin expansion to 10.0% due to effective cost control and pricing power.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value.
    *   *Calculation:* $52.67 * (1 - 0.30) = **$36.87**.

### **One-Paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include significant and persistent commodity inflation, particularly in beef prices, which could compress margins more than anticipated. A slowdown in consumer discretionary spending due to macroeconomic headwinds could negatively impact traffic and revenue growth. Increased competition in the casual dining sector could pressure pricing power and market share. Finally, the valuation is highly sensitive to the terminal growth rate and WACC assumptions; a higher discount rate or lower terminal growth would result in a lower intrinsic value.

final answer is 52.67 $
