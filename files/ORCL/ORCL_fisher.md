Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: FY2024 10-K Report (ending May 31, 2024), Q3 FY2025 10-Q Report (ending February 28, 2025), Q4 FY2024 Earnings Call Transcript (June 11, 2024).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oracle's growth is centered on its cloud services, particularly Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and its suite of cloud applications (Fusion and NetSuite). The company reported Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) of $98.0 billion as of May 31, 2024, an increase of 44% year-over-year, indicating a substantial backlog of contracted future revenue. Management consistently points to high demand for AI training capacity and cloud migration as primary drivers, signing numerous large OCI contracts, including a notable partnership with Google to make Oracle's database available in Google Cloud.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oracle is aggressively investing in its cloud infrastructure to meet demand for AI workloads, with capital expenditures expected to be around $7 billion in fiscal year 2025. The company is expanding its data center footprint globally, with plans for dozens of new facilities. R&D expenses were $8.6 billion for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, demonstrating a continued financial commitment to innovation. Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison has emphasized bringing new cloud regions online and developing more powerful AI services as top priorities.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, Oracle’s R&D expense of $8.6 billion represented 13.9% of its $61.9 billion in total revenue. The effectiveness of this spending is demonstrated by the rapid growth in its cloud businesses and the market's reception of OCI's AI capabilities, as evidenced by the 44% growth in Remaining Performance Obligations. The company's ability to secure large-scale AI training contracts from major players like OpenAI (via a partnership with Microsoft) suggests its R&D is producing a competitive infrastructure.
**Answer:** Yes

(https://discountingcashflows.com/company/ORCL/transcripts/)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's ability to secure massive contracts, contributing to a $98 billion RPO, is direct evidence of a highly effective sales organization. CEO Safra Catz noted on the Q4 2024 earnings call that RPO had grown by $31 billion in one year, stating, "the bookings were just incredible." The sales team is successfully cross-selling cloud infrastructure to its massive existing database and applications customer base, a key pillar of the company's growth strategy. The announced partnership to sell Oracle Database services within the Google Cloud ecosystem further expands its sales channels.
**Answer:** Yes

(https://discountingcashflows.com/company/ORCL/transcripts/)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024, Oracle reported a GAAP operating margin of 26% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 40%. The non-GAAP figure, which excludes items like stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets, declined from 44% in fiscal 2023. This margin compression is attributed to the integration of the lower-margin Cerner business and heavy capital investments in building new data centers. While still a profitable company, the recent negative trend in margins prevents a clear "Yes."
**Answer:** No

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's primary strategy for margin improvement is to scale its high-growth cloud businesses. CEO Safra Catz stated that as the cloud business grows, "it will be a higher-and-higher margin business." The company is also working to improve the profitability of the acquired Cerner business by migrating it to OCI. Further actions include disciplined operational expense control. However, management has also guided for continued high capital expenditures in the near term, which will continue to pressure margins before the benefits of scale are fully realized.
**Answer:** Yes

(https://discountingcashflows.com/company/ORCL/transcripts/)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oracle's public filings do not provide specific metrics on employee attrition, engagement, or satisfaction that would support a claim of "outstanding" relations. Like many large technology companies, Oracle has conducted periodic layoffs and restructurings, particularly following the Cerner acquisition, to eliminate overlapping functions and rationalize costs. Without transparent, positive data from the company on key personnel metrics, this criterion cannot be met.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oracle has a long-tenured and stable senior executive team. CEO Safra Catz has been with the company since 1999 and has been CEO since 2014. Chairman and CTO Larry Ellison, the company's founder, remains deeply involved in technology and product strategy. This stability at the top provides a consistent long-term vision. The executive team has worked together for many years, suggesting a cohesive and effective working relationship.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Oracle Corporation, "Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024," published June 20, 2024. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the long-serving CEO and CTO, Oracle has a deep bench of executives leading its various business units, though they are less visible publicly. The company's proxy statements list several other key executive officers responsible for critical functions. However, there is a significant key-person risk associated with Larry Ellison, given his foundational role in the company's technology vision and strategy. While a succession plan exists on paper, his influence is difficult to replicate.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** Oracle Corporation, "DEF 14A Proxy Statement," filed September 15, 2023. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000119312523237836/d523174ddef14a.htm)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, mature public company, Oracle has extensive and well-documented accounting controls. The company's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. The 10-K filing states that management has concluded that the company's internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the same date. There is no recent history of material restatements or control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Oracle Corporation, "Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024," published June 20, 2024. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017024075605/orcl-20240531.htm)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oracle's key competitive advantage is its massive, decades-long incumbency in mission-critical enterprise databases and applications. This creates significant customer switching costs and a large, captive base to which it can cross-sell its OCI services. The ability to offer a full stack, from infrastructure (OCI) to platform (database) to applications (Fusion, NetSuite), is a key differentiator. The company's recent focus on providing sovereign cloud and AI regions for nations is another unique and powerful competitive angle.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is explicitly trading near-term profitability for long-term market share in the cloud infrastructure market. In the Q4 2024 earnings call, CEO Safra Catz stated, "we are making decisions to spend more to get more," referring to the aggressive capital expenditures for data center construction. This strategy knowingly compresses near-term operating margins with the expectation that capturing lucrative, long-term AI and cloud contracts will generate much higher profits in the future.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Oracle generated $11.8 billion in cash from operations in the nine months ended February 28, 2025. The company has a strong balance sheet and consistent access to the debt markets. Oracle has a history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases, not issuing shares for financing. Foreseeable growth, including the high capital expenditures, is expected to be funded by operating cash flow and debt, not dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Oracle Corporation, "Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 28, 2025," published March 11, 2025. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341439/000095017025037143/orcl-20250228.htm)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, particularly Safra Catz and Larry Ellison, maintains a consistent and open dialogue with investors through quarterly earnings calls. They are transparent about their strategic priorities, such as the trade-off between near-term margins and long-term cloud investment. They directly address challenges, such as the slower-than-expected transition of the Cerner business to the cloud, and provide rationale for their decisions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** Oracle Corporation, "Q4 2024 Oracle Corporation Earnings Conference Call," June 11, 2024. (https://discountingcashflows.com/company/ORCL/transcripts/)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & evidence:** Oracle has faced regulatory scrutiny in the past. For instance, in September 2022, the SEC announced charges against Oracle for violating provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) related to conduct in Turkey, the UAE, and India, for which Oracle agreed to pay more than $23 million to resolve. While the company resolved this matter without admitting or denying the findings, such recurring regulatory actions raise questions and prevent a clear "Yes" for "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, "SEC Charges Oracle a Second Time for Violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act," Press Release, September 27, 2022. (https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-177)

Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
Oracle's primary strengths under Fisher's framework are its enormous and growing backlog in cloud and AI services, a clear commitment to funding this growth through heavy R&D and capital investment, and a stable, long-term-focused executive team. The strategy of sacrificing near-term margins for market share is explicitly communicated and represents a classic long-range outlook. The main weaknesses identified are the resulting recent-term pressure on profit margins and a lack of verifiable evidence for outstanding employee relations. The score is also negatively impacted by past regulatory issues and a concentration of strategic vision in its founder. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are a stabilization and subsequent improvement in operating margins (flipping Point 5 to "Yes") and the successful, scaled conversion of the $98 billion backlog into revenue, which would validate the current investment-heavy strategy. Evidence of improved profitability at the Cerner unit post-OCI migration would also significantly strengthen the case.

fisher score is 11 / 15
