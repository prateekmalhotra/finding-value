Synthesis: MSA Safety appears to be a high-quality company that scores well on all 15 of Fisher's points. The company has a strong competitive position in the attractive safety products market, a long runway for growth, and a proven management team. The score is unlikely to change significantly in the next 12-24 months, but key variables to watch include the successful integration of any new acquisitions and the continued development of innovative new products. A "No" would be triggered by a significant product recall, a major labor dispute, or a material misstatement of the company's financial results.
