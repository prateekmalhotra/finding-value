Synthesis:
McDonald's scores well on most of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting its strong brand, profitable business model, and long-term growth strategy. The "Accelerating the Arches" plan, with its focus on core menu items, digital innovation, and restaurant expansion, provides a clear path for future growth. The company's financial strength, demonstrated by its high profit margins and commitment to shareholder returns, is another positive. The main areas of concern are labor relations and integrity, where the company has faced legal and reputational challenges. To improve its score, McDonald's will need to address these issues and demonstrate a stronger commitment to its employees and ethical business practices. The success of its global expansion plans and the continued evolution of its menu and digital offerings will be key variables to watch over the next 12–24 months.
