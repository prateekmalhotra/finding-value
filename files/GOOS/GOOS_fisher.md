Company: Canada Goose Holdings Inc. (GOOS)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Fiscal Year 2025 Annual Report (Form 20-F, filed May 21, 2025), Q4 and Full-Year FY2025 Earnings Release (May 21, 2025), and Q1 FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript (August 1, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Canada Goose is expanding beyond its core heavyweight parkas into adjacent categories like lightweight down, rainwear, apparel, footwear, and accessories, including a new eyewear collection launched in Fiscal 2025. The company is also focused on growing its direct-to-consumer (DTC) footprint, ending FY2025 with 74 stores. However, overall revenue growth in Fiscal 2025 was modest at 1.1%, and while DTC revenue grew 5.1%, comparable sales declined 3.6%, indicating maturity and competition in core areas. The potential for a "sizable" increase in sales hinges entirely on the success of these newer, less-proven categories.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has explicitly stated that evolving the brand and product offering is a key priority. In Fiscal 2025, the company appointed Haider Ackermann as its first Creative Director, launched the "Snow Goose" capsule to elevate the brand, and introduced an eyewear collection. These actions demonstrate a clear strategy to innovate and expand beyond the traditional product portfolio to capture new revenue streams.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a performance luxury apparel company, Canada Goose does not disclose research and development (R&D) expenses as a separate line item, which is common in the industry. Product development is integrated into operating expenses. Without specific metrics on R&D spending, patent filings, or success rates of new launches versus peers, it is not possible to verify the effectiveness of its R&D efforts relative to its size based on publicly available information.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy is centered on shifting from wholesale to a direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, which gives it greater control over branding and margins. In Fiscal 2025, DTC revenue accounted for 74% of total sales, growing 5.1% year-over-year. This channel includes a global network of 74 retail stores and a robust e-commerce platform. While the negative 3.6% DTC comparable sales for the full year is a concern, the focus on a high-touch, direct sales model is a hallmark of a modern luxury brand.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For Fiscal 2025, Canada Goose reported a gross margin of 69.9%, an increase from 68.8% in the prior year. This high gross margin is indicative of the brand's luxury positioning and pricing power. The company's consolidated operating margin for Fiscal 2025 was 8.3%. These margins are robust for the apparel industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The primary driver of margin improvement is the strategic shift toward the higher-margin DTC channel, which now constitutes the majority of the business. Additionally, the Fiscal 2025 results highlighted significant inventory optimization, with levels reduced by 14% year-over-year, which helps reduce the need for markdowns and provisioning. CEO Dani Reiss also noted a key priority is "simplifying internal operations" to enhance efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific, recent, and verifiable evidence in primary source documents (filings, transcripts) to definitively assess the state of labor and personnel relations. The company's filings mention its commitment to Canadian manufacturing, which is a positive signal for local employment. However, without data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations, it is not possible to confirm they are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dani Reiss, the grandson of the founder, has been the CEO since 2001 and is also Chairman, providing long-term stability and a clear vision rooted in the company's heritage. The executive team appears stable. However, without specific disclosures on succession planning or internal board dynamics, it is difficult to assess the full picture of executive relations against Fisher's high standard of "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company lists a C-suite of nine executives on its investor relations site, covering key functions like finance, product, operations, commercial, and legal. This indicates a professionalized management structure beyond the CEO. However, public documents and conference calls do not provide significant detail on the bench strength or succession plans for these key roles, making it difficult to fully evaluate management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://investor.canadagoose.com/governance/executive-management](https://investor.canadagoose.com/governance/executive-management) (Accessed August 24, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides segmented financial results (DTC, Wholesale, Other) and regional breakdowns, offering a clear view of performance. In its Fiscal 2025 report, management highlighted a 14% year-over-year reduction in inventory, demonstrating strong working capital discipline and control. The annual 20-F filing includes an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, indicating no material weaknesses were found.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Canada Goose's long-standing commitment to "Made in Canada" manufacturing is a powerful competitive advantage in the luxury space, serving as a pillar of its brand authenticity and justification for premium pricing. This vertical integration also provides greater control over quality. Furthermore, the company's direct control over its retail presentation via its growing network of flagship stores allows it to manage the customer experience in a way that wholesale-dependent rivals cannot.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. The deliberate shift from a profitable wholesale business to a capital-intensive DTC model, including building a global store network, prioritizes long-term brand equity and margin potential over short-term gains. Investments in a creative director and new product categories that may take years to scale, even amid flat recent sales growth, further support this conclusion.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generated positive net income of $94.8 million in Fiscal 2025 and improved its net debt position to $408.8 million from $584.1 million in the prior year. Canada Goose maintains a revolving credit facility for liquidity. Given its profitability and access to debt markets, the company appears well-positioned to fund its operational needs and store expansion plans without needing to issue dilutive equity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reviewing recent earnings call transcripts, management openly discussed challenging areas, such as the full-year decline in DTC comparable sales (-3.6%) and weakness in the wholesale channel (-16.5%). They directly address analyst questions on these topics. However, Fisher’s standard requires a long-term pattern of transparency through significant difficulties, which is hard to confirm without a longer history of crisis communication to review.
**Answer:** No

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent, significant legal or regulatory actions, related-party transactions, or governance red flags apparent from the company's latest annual filing. The company faced past criticism from animal rights groups regarding its use of coyote fur, but it has since committed to and executed a plan to cease using fur in its products by the end of 2022. This responsiveness to a major ESG concern is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis**

Canada Goose scores well on factors within its direct control: strong profit margins, brand authenticity tied to Canadian manufacturing, and a clear long-term strategy focused on the high-margin DTC channel. The company's financials appear solid enough to avoid shareholder dilution. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses and uncertainties regarding its future growth trajectory, with recent top-line stagnation being a major concern. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables: the success of its product-line expansion and a return to positive DTC comparable sales growth. To flip the "No" on "Long Runway" to "Yes," the company must demonstrate that its newer categories can generate sizable, sustained revenue growth. More corporate disclosure on R&D effectiveness and management depth would also be required to improve the score.

**fisher score is 9 / 15**
