Company, August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Booking Holdings Inc. 2024 10-K, Q1 & Q2 2025 10-Q filings, and Q2 2025 earnings call transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Booking Holdings operates in the global travel and tourism industry, which is valued in the trillions of dollars and continues to grow. The company's primary growth vector is the "Connected Trip," a strategy to seamlessly integrate multiple travel components—accommodations, flights, rental cars, and experiences—into a single platform. As of its Q2 2025 earnings call, management noted that flights and other non-accommodation verticals are growing faster than the core business, indicating a large addressable market remains. The ongoing shift from offline to online bookings globally, particularly in less penetrated markets, provides a durable tailwind.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BKNG/transcripts/' (August 7, 2025)]

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategic focus is consistently on technology-driven initiatives to expand its market. The "Connected Trip" vision is a multi-year investment to move beyond the mature accommodation segment. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Glenn Fogel highlighted investments in AI, including the "AI Trip Planner," to enhance user experience and cross-sell additional services. The company's 2024 10-K details significant and continuous investment in "information technology" to support innovation and the development of new products.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BKNG/transcripts/' (August 7, 2025)]

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Booking Holdings does not break out R&D as a separate line item, embedding it within "Information technology" and "Personnel" expenses. However, its effectiveness can be inferred from its market leadership and operational scale. The company's technology platforms processed over $150 billion in gross bookings in 2024, demonstrating a highly effective and scalable infrastructure. The successful rollout and user adoption of features like the AI Trip Planner and loyalty programs (like Genius) indicate that technology spending translates directly into enhanced customer engagement and business growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BKNG/transcripts/' (August 7, 2025)]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s "sales" function is primarily its highly efficient performance marketing engine and its partner network services. In 2024, the company spent $7.3 billion on marketing, which generated $21.4 billion in revenue, showcasing an efficient and scaled customer acquisition model. The company's supply network, which includes millions of properties and airline partners, is a testament to its effective B2B "sales" and partner-support organization. The sheer global scale and return on marketing investment are well above industry averages.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Booking Holdings consistently demonstrates strong profitability. For the full year 2024, the company reported a GAAP operating margin of 32.5%. In its most recent quarterly filing (Q2 2025), the company reported a robust operating margin of 34.8%, demonstrating sustained high profitability even with significant investments in marketing and technology. These margins are consistently at the top of the online travel agency (OTA) industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000036/bkng-20250630.htm' (August 7, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on several levers to improve margins. A key strategy is increasing the mix of direct bookings (customers coming directly to its apps and websites), which reduces reliance on costly performance marketing channels. The "Connected Trip" strategy aims to increase customer lifetime value by selling higher-margin services beyond the initial transaction. Additionally, the company is leveraging automation and AI in customer service to create operating efficiencies and control headcount growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BKNG/transcripts/' (August 7, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states it has "good relationships with our employees." However, there is limited publicly available, verifiable data to substantiate "outstanding" relations. The company does not disclose employee turnover rates or engagement scores. While there is no evidence of widespread labor disputes, the high bar of "outstanding" is not met by the available disclosures.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability. Glenn Fogel has served as CEO since 2017 and has been with the company or its subsidiaries since 2000. The broader management team also includes long-tenured executives, indicating a stable and cohesive leadership environment. Succession planning appears to be orderly, with smooth transitions in key roles over the years. There are no public reports of significant infighting or abrupt departures among senior leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, management depth is a strength. The company is structured with CEOs for each major brand (Booking.com, Priceline, Agoda, Kayak), creating a layer of experienced operating executives below the corporate level. This decentralized structure empowers leaders with deep domain expertise and provides a pipeline of potential successors for top corporate roles. The executive team named in filings represents a broad set of functional expertise from technology to finance and marketing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Booking Holdings' financial reporting appears robust. The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment information, allowing for analysis of performance across its various brands and services. There is no recent history of material restatements or significant control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's key competitive advantage is a powerful two-sided network effect. Its vast portfolio of over 28 million accommodation listings attracts a massive base of travelers, which in turn encourages more property owners and other travel providers to join the platform. This scale is self-reinforcing and creates a formidable barrier to entry that is difficult for smaller competitors to overcome. This network effect is the single most important clue to its competitive dominance in the OTA industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes long-term investments over short-term profit maximization. The multi-year, multi-billion dollar investment in the "Connected Trip" is the primary evidence of this long-range view. In earnings calls, CEO Glenn Fogel frequently discusses the importance of building market leadership and customer loyalty for the long run, even if it requires elevated marketing and technology spend in the near term, which could otherwise be taken as profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025), 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BKNG/transcripts/' (August 7, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong. As of June 30, 2025, Booking Holdings had $28.5 billion in cash and investments. The company generates significant free cash flow and has an active share repurchase program, having bought back $2.6 billion of its stock in the second quarter of 2025 alone. This demonstrates that the company can easily fund its growth initiatives and return capital to shareholders without needing to issue dilutive equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000036/bkng-20250630.htm' (August 7, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a consistent and transparent dialogue with investors. During quarterly earnings calls, the leadership team provides detailed commentary on business trends, strategic initiatives, and challenges. They openly discuss competitive pressures, macroeconomic headwinds, and regulatory risks, as detailed in their filings' "Risk Factors" sections. This level of transparency in both positive and negative environments suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/BKNG/transcripts/' (August 7, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags suggesting a lack of integrity. A review of recent SEC filings reveals no material related-party transactions, accounting scandals, or internal control issues flagged by auditors. While the company faces regulatory scrutiny, particularly in Europe regarding competition (e.g., the Digital Markets Act), this is an industry-wide issue and not indicative of specific management misconduct. Standard governance practices appear to be in place.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000036/bkng-20250630.htm' (August 7, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1075531/000107553125000010/bkng-20241231.htm' (February 22, 2025)]

Synthesis:
Booking Holdings scores highly on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its dominant market position, strong financial health, and long-term strategic focus. The company's primary strengths lie in its vast market opportunity, powerful network effects, robust profitability, and a stable, experienced management team committed to reinvesting for growth. The only "No" reflects a lack of specific public evidence to deem its labor relations "outstanding," which is a very high bar. The variables most likely to change the overall score in the next 12-24 months are the execution of the "Connected Trip" strategy, the impact of AI on user adoption and margins, and the evolving regulatory landscape, especially in Europe. A successful, margin-accretive scaling of non-accommodation verticals would solidify the growth narrative, while adverse regulatory rulings could challenge its business model and long-term profitability.

fisher score is 14 / 15
