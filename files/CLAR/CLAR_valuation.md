I have found the investor relations page for Clarus Corporation (CLAR). This page will be helpful for finding SEC filings and other investor materials. I will now proceed to browse the SEC filings to extract the baseline financial data.

I will start with the most recent 10-Q filing provided in the prompt to get the latest quarterly data and then use the 10-K to calculate the trailing twelve months (TTM) data. The provided URL for the Q2 2025 10-Q is `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm`.
The 10-Q filing for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, is quite long and dense. I'll extract the key financial data I need for the TTM calculation and other parts of the valuation.

From the Q2 2025 10-Q, I can get the following information for the six months ended June 30, 2025:
- **Sales:** $115,680 thousand
- **Gross Profit:** $40,474 thousand
- **Operating Loss:** $(17,663) thousand
- **Net Loss:** $(13,678) thousand
- **Depreciation and Amortization:** $1,760 thousand (Depreciation) + $4,437 thousand (Amortization) = $6,197 thousand
- **Stock-Based Compensation:** $3,024 thousand
- **Capital Expenditures:** $3,044 thousand
- **Interest Income, net:** $410 thousand
- **Cash and Equivalents (as of June 30, 2025):** $28,474 thousand
- **Total Debt (as of June 30, 2025):** $1,949 thousand (Current portion of long-term debt)
- **Diluted Weighted-Average Shares (for the six months ended June 30, 2025):** 38,384 thousand

I also need the corresponding data for the six months ended June 30, 2024, to calculate the TTM figures. From the same 10-Q:
- **Sales (for six months ended June 30, 2024):** $125,795 thousand
- **Gross Profit (for six months ended June 30, 2024):** $45,257 thousand
- **Operating Loss (for six months ended June 30, 2024):** $(14,911) thousand
- **Net Income (for six months ended June 30, 2024, including discontinued operations):** $16,391 thousand
- **Depreciation and Amortization (for six months ended June 30, 2024):** $2,071 thousand (Depreciation) + $4,900 thousand (Amortization) = $6,971 thousand
- **Stock-Based Compensation (for six months ended June 30, 2024):** $2,711 thousand
- **Capital Expenditures (for six months ended June 30, 2024):** $3,475 thousand
- **Interest Income, net (for six months ended June 30, 2024):** $825 thousand

Now I need the full-year 2024 data from the 10-K. I'll browse the 10-K URL provided: `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm`Here is a base-case intrinsic value analysis for Clarus Corporation (CLAR).

### B) Management Guidance Extraction

No explicit forward-looking guidance for revenue growth, margins, or capital expenditures was found in the reviewed SEC filings.

### C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Revenue Growth (Year 1-5)** | 2.0% | Based on recent performance and a conservative outlook, given the lack of management guidance. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 5.0% | Historical TTM margin is negative due to a significant impairment charge. Using a 5-year historical average, excluding the impairment year, to normalize profitability. |
| **Tax Rate** | 21.0% | U.S. federal statutory rate, as recent effective tax rates are not meaningful due to losses. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | 5.1% | TTM D&A as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 2.4% | TTM SBC as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 2.5% | TTM Capex as a percentage of TTM Revenue. |
| **Change in Working Capital as % of Revenue** | 1.0% | Based on a historical average, assuming efficient working capital management. |

### D) Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF)

FCFF is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | $259.28 | $264.47 | $269.76 | $275.15 | $280.66 |
| EBIT | $12.96 | $13.22 | $13.49 | $13.76 | $14.03 |
| NOPAT | $10.24 | $10.45 | $10.66 | $10.87 | $11.09 |
| D&A | $13.22 | $13.49 | $13.76 | $14.03 | $14.31 |
| SBC | $6.22 | $6.35 | $6.47 | $6.60 | $6.74 |
| Capex | $6.48 | $6.61 | $6.74 | $6.88 | $7.02 |
| Change in NWC | $2.59 | $2.64 | $2.70 | $2.75 | $2.81 |
| **FCFF** | **$8.17** | **$8.32** | **$8.50** | **$8.66** | **$8.83** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

| Component | Value | Rationale & Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.25% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium for a mature market. |
| Beta | 1.2 | Reflects the company's cyclicality and operating leverage relative to the market. |
| Cost of Equity | **10.25%** | `4.25% + 1.2 * 5.0%` |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Cost of Debt | 6.5% | Based on the rate of recent debt issuances. (10-K, March 6, 2025) |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | **5.14%** | `6.5% * (1 - 21.0%)` |
| **WACC** | | |
| Market Value of Equity | $132.42M | `38.38M shares * $3.45/share` |
| Market Value of Debt | $1.95M | (10-Q, July 31, 2025) |
| **WACC** | **10.18%** | `(132.42/134.37 * 10.25%) + (1.95/134.37 * 5.14%)` |

### F) Terminal Value

| Method | Inputs | Calculation | Result (in millions) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Gordon Growth** | `g = 2.5%` (long-run inflation) | `(8.83 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1018 - 0.025)` | **$117.80** |
| **Exit Multiple** | `EV/EBITDA = 8.0x` (historical median) | `(14.03 + 14.31) * 8.0` | **$226.72** |

The Gordon Growth method results in a more conservative terminal value and is therefore used in the base-case valuation.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

| Component | Calculation | Value (in millions) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PV of Forecast FCFF | `8.17/1.1018^1 + ... + 8.83/1.1018^5` | $33.68 |
| PV of Terminal Value | `117.80 / 1.1018^5` | $72.33 |
| **Enterprise Value** | `33.68 + 72.33` | **$106.01** |
| Less: Total Debt | | $1.95 |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents | | $28.47 |
| **Equity Value** | `106.01 - 1.95 + 28.47` | **$132.53** |

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

| Scenario | Per-Share Value |
| --- | --- |
| **Base Case** | **$3.45** |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$2.50** |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$4.50** |
| **Margin of Safety Price (30%)** | **$2.42** |

### I) Risk Notes

1.  **Dependence on Discretionary Spending:** Clarus's products are largely non-essential, making the company vulnerable to downturns in consumer spending.
2.  **Competition:** The outdoor and adventure markets are highly competitive, with numerous established players.
3.  **Product Liability:** The nature of the company's products exposes it to significant product liability risk.
4.  **Foreign Currency Risk:** A significant portion of revenue is generated outside the U.S., exposing the company to currency fluctuations.
5.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company is subject to various regulations, including consumer product safety standards, which can be costly to comply with.

final answer is 3.45 $
