### Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)

#### 1. Catalyst Title: Share Repurchase Program
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program, allowing the company to repurchase up to $100.0 million of its common stock from January 1, 2025, through December 31, 2025. As of February 28, 2025, approximately $75.0 million remained available for share repurchase.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can lead to an increase in earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, all else being equal, can lead to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** January 1, 2025 - December 31, 2025
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $25.0 million of its common stock.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases an additional $50.0 million of its common stock.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases the full remaining $75.0 million of its common stock.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a history of completing its share repurchase programs.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price must be at a level that management deems attractive for repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and annual reports on Form 10-K for updates on share repurchase activity.
    *   Press releases announcing any new or expanded share repurchase programs.
    *   Daily stock price and volume.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   The company could decide to use its cash for other purposes, such as acquisitions.
    *   A downturn in the housing market could lead to a decrease in cash flow, limiting the company's ability to repurchase shares.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the company's quarterly reports and press releases for updates on share repurchase activity.

#### 2. Catalyst Title: Dividend Increase
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On May 6, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.29 per share, payable on July 24, 2025, to stockholders of record on July 3, 2025. This represents an increase from the previous quarterly dividend of $0.28 per share.
*   **Mechanism:** A dividend increase signals to investors that the company is confident in its future earnings and cash flow. This can lead to an increase in demand for the stock, driving up the price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing. Dividends are typically declared quarterly.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company maintains the current quarterly dividend of $0.29 per share.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company increases the quarterly dividend to $0.30 per share in the next 12 months.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company increases the quarterly dividend to $0.31 per share in the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (1-3%)
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a history of increasing its dividend.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's earnings and cash flow must continue to support a higher dividend.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly earnings reports and press releases for dividend announcements.
    *   Cash flow from operations.
    *   Payout ratio (dividends per share / earnings per share).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the housing market could lead to a decrease in earnings and cash flow, making a dividend increase less likely.
    *   The company could decide to use its cash for other purposes, such as share repurchases or acquisitions.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the company's quarterly earnings reports and press releases for dividend announcements.

### Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)

*   **Mechanism:** The new and expanded facilities are expected to improve service, production efficiencies, and safety. They will also reduce the company's reliance on outsourced finished goods and component products, and ensure ample capacity to meet customer needs. These improvements could lead to higher margins and increased market share, driving long-term earnings growth.
*   **Timing:** 2025 and beyond.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The new facilities lead to a 1% increase in operating margin.

    *   The new facilities may not achieve the expected efficiency gains.
    *   A downturn in the housing market could lead to a decrease in demand, making it difficult for the company to utilize the new capacity.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The new facilities are a significant long-term growth driver for the company.

### Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)

*   **Share Repurchase Program:**
    *   **Formula:** (Market Capitalization / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) \* P/E Ratio
    *   **Assumptions:** Market Capitalization = $8.2 billion, Shares Outstanding = 41.8 million, P/E Ratio = 25.
    *   **Calculation:** ($8.2 billion / (41.8 million - 0.4 million)) \* 25 = **$201.46 per share** (a 2.3% increase from the current price of $197.82).

*   **New Facility Openings and Expansions:**
    *   **Formula:** ((Operating Income \* (1 + Margin Increase)) / Shares Outstanding) \* P/E Ratio
    *   **Assumptions:** Operating Income = $430.0 million, Margin Increase = 2%, Shares Outstanding = 41.8 million, P/E Ratio = 25.
    *   **Calculation:** (($430.0 million \* (1 + 0.02)) / 41.8 million) \* 25 = **$205.49 per share** (a 3.9% increase from the current price of $197.82).

### Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal

The near-term catalysts for Simpson Manufacturing are largely positive, with a clear commitment to returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. The completion of the new facilities in late 2025 will provide a significant boost to the company's long-term growth prospects. The stock has already reached a 52-week high, suggesting that some of this positive news is already priced in. However, the company has a strong track record of execution, and the continued strength of the housing market should provide a tailwind for the stock in the near term.

### Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts

1.  **A significant downturn in the U.S. housing market:** A sharp decline in housing starts would lead to a decrease in demand for Simpson's products, negatively impacting sales and earnings.
2.  **A sharp increase in steel prices:** Steel is a key raw material for Simpson, and a significant increase in prices could lead to a decrease in margins.
3.  **A major operational issue at one of the company's new facilities:** Any significant delays or problems with the new facilities in Columbus and Gallatin could negatively impact the company's growth plans.

### Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)

Simpson Manufacturing is a well-run company with a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders. The new facilities in Columbus and Gallatin will be a significant long-term growth driver. The stock is currently trading at a 52-week high, so investors may want to wait for a pullback before initiating a position. The most important indicator to monitor is the health of the U.S. housing market.
