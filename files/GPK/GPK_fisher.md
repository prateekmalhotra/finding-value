Company: Graphic Packaging Holding Company (GPK)
Date of Analysis: August 22, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: FY2024 10-K, Q1 2025 10-Q, and Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Graphic Packaging operates in the consumer packaging industry, with a focus on fiber-based products like folding cartons and paperboard. The primary growth driver is the consumer and regulatory-driven shift away from plastic to more sustainable, fiber-based packaging solutions. In its 2024 10-K, the company notes that its "key growth platforms are fiber-based packaging solutions that serve as alternatives to less sustainable packaging." This trend supports demand in its core end-markets, including food, beverage, and foodservice, which themselves have stable, long-term demand characteristics. The company is actively investing in capacity to meet this anticipated growth, indicating a long runway.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes its focus on innovation to capitalize on the plastic substitution trend. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, the CEO highlighted the development of new products like Chick-fil-A's salad bowl and multi-pack beverage containers as examples of "executing on our innovation-led growth strategy." The company's 2024 10-K mentions its Innovation Centers in Atlanta, GA, and Bardon, UK, which are dedicated to developing new packaging solutions. This is further supported by strategic capital expenditures aimed at enhancing product capabilities and efficiency.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Graphic Packaging's R&D expenses were $62 million in 2024, representing approximately 0.7% of net sales. This percentage is modest, which is typical for a mature manufacturing industry focused more on process and material innovation than pure-play R&D. While the company highlights successful product launches like the aforementioned salad bowl, it does not disclose specific metrics such as the percentage of revenue from new products or patent filings that would allow for a rigorous assessment of R&D effectiveness versus peers. The focus appears to be on customer-led innovation rather than breakthrough, internally generated technology.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has long-standing relationships with major consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies and foodservice brands. Its 2024 10-K states, "We believe our long-term relationships with our customers are a key competitive advantage." However, the company does not provide specific data on customer retention/churn, net revenue retention (NRR), or new logo acquisition rates. While its position as a key supplier to blue-chip customers implies a competent sales force, there is insufficient public evidence to definitively conclude it is "above-average" compared to competitors.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Graphic Packaging reported a gross profit margin of approximately 22.1% and an operating profit margin of 10.5%. As of the first quarter of 2025, the company reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.1%. These margins are solid for a manufacturing business and have been a point of focus for management. They represent a significant improvement over historical levels, demonstrating the company's ability to generate strong profits in its industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1408075/000140807525000007/gpk-20241231.htm'] (February 23, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1408075/000140807525000013/gpk-20250331.htm'] (May 7, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through several levers. In its Q1 2025 10-Q, the company discusses pricing actions to offset inflation and favorable net performance related to "cost savings from procurement and other operational efficiencies." The company is also executing on significant capital projects, such as the new Waco, Texas, coated recycled board (CRB) mill, which is expected to be a lower-cost facility. In earnings calls, management frequently discusses productivity initiatives and operational excellence as core tenets of its strategy to sustain and enhance margins.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, approximately 46% of the company's employees were represented by a union. The 2024 10-K notes the risk of potential work stoppages but also states, "The Company believes that it has good relations with its employees." While there are no reports of significant recent labor strife, there is also a lack of publicly available data (e.g., employee turnover rates, engagement scores) to support a claim of "outstanding" relations. The high percentage of unionized labor itself introduces a level of complexity and potential risk not present in non-unionized workforces.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Graphic Packaging exhibits stability. Michael P. Doss has been CEO since 2016 and with the company for over 30 years. Other key executives also have long tenures, suggesting a cohesive and stable leadership environment. The company has a formal succession planning process discussed in its proxy statements. This stability at the top is a positive indicator of solid executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the long-tenured CEO and CFO, Graphic Packaging has a well-defined executive leadership team with clear responsibilities across divisions like the Americas and EMEA, and functions like human resources and supply chain. The company’s investor materials and SEC filings show a clear hierarchy and experienced leaders in key operating roles. This structure suggests a professional organization with sufficient depth to manage the business and mitigate key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1408075/000140807525000007/gpk-20241231.htm'] (February 23, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Graphic Packaging provides clear, segmented financial reporting for its key product lines (Paperboard, Americas, and EMEA). The company's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP. Furthermore, management's report on internal control over financial reporting confirmed its effectiveness, with no material weaknesses identified. This indicates robust and reliable accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the paper and packaging industry is vertical integration—owning the mills that produce the paperboard used in converting facilities. Graphic Packaging is highly integrated, which provides greater control over its supply chain, costs, and innovation capabilities. Its 2024 10-K details its network of mills and converting plants. This integration, combined with its scale, allows for production efficiencies and a more resilient supply chain compared to non-integrated competitors.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has undertaken significant multi-year capital expenditure projects, such as the Waco mill and the prior Kalamazoo mill, which required substantial upfront investment and temporarily suppressed free cash flow. These investments were made with the explicit goal of lowering long-term production costs and capturing future growth in recycled paperboard. This willingness to invest heavily for long-term structural advantages, as detailed in investor presentations and the 10-K's "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section, demonstrates a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1408075/000140807525000007/gpk-20241231.htm'] (February 23, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generates substantial operating cash flow ($1.4 billion in 2024). While leverage has been elevated to fund strategic investments and acquisitions, management has a stated goal of reducing debt. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, the CFO noted their focus on debt reduction. The company's growth plans and capital expenditures are funded through cash flow and debt, not through dilutive equity offerings. Its history is one of acquisitions and capital spending funded by debt and cash, with share buybacks often executed when leverage is lower.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a consistent rhythm of communication through quarterly earnings calls and participation in investor conferences. In reviewing earnings call transcripts, such as the Q1 2025 call, management addresses challenges directly, including volume declines in certain categories and the impact of inflation and scheduled maintenance downtime. They provide detailed financial guidance and are responsive to analyst questions, suggesting a healthy level of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/GPK/transcripts/'] (Q1 2025, May 7, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings, including the 2024 10-K, reveals no material legal proceedings that would suggest a lack of integrity at the executive level. There are no disclosed related-party transactions involving top management, and the company has a clear code of conduct. Governance structures appear standard, and the audit opinions are clean. There are no red flags to question the integrity of the leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Graphic Packaging Holding Company scores well against Fisher's checklist, particularly in areas related to its strategic position, financial health, and management quality. The company's strengths are its long runway for growth tied to the plastic-to-fiber substitution trend, its vertically integrated business model, a long-term investment horizon, and a stable, experienced management team with robust financial controls. The primary weaknesses identified are a lack of specific, public evidence to classify its R&D, sales, and labor relations as "outstanding" in the demanding Fisher sense, even if they are perfectly adequate. The score would be most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on the execution of its major capital projects, particularly the Waco mill. Successfully bringing that facility online to deliver expected cost and sustainability benefits would reinforce the long-term outlook, while any significant delays or cost overruns could call it into question. To flip the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to disclose more granular KPIs, such as revenue from new products (for R&D effectiveness) or customer retention rates (for sales force quality).

fisher score is 12 / 15
