**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the market's expectations, we solve for the revenue growth rate that justifies the current stock price, holding the TTM operating margin constant.

*   **Market Capitalization:** $5,720.87/share * 33.0M shares = **$188,789M**
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $188,789M (Market Cap) + $19,239M (Debt) - $17,595M (Cash) = **$190,433M**
*   **WACC (preliminary):** 9.72% (Calculated and justified in Part 2)
*   **TTM Operating Margin:** 33.26% ($8,324M / $25,025M)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

*   **Conclusion:** After iterating a DCF model, to arrive at an enterprise value of ~$190.4 billion, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 14.5%**, assuming operating margins remain constant at the current TTM level of 33.26%.

**This means that to justify today's stock price, one must believe Booking Holdings can grow its revenue by ~14.5% annually for the next five years while maintaining its current high level of profitability.**

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on conservative, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Review:** The market's implied 14.5% growth is robust. For comparison, BKNG's revenue growth from fiscal 2022 to 2023 was 25.0%, and from 2023 to 2024 it was 11.1%. An average of ~15% seems plausible but aggressive. My base case will assume a tapering growth rate.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1â€“5:** I will use a **12% growth rate in Year 1, tapering down by 1.5% each year to 6% in Year 5.** This reflects a moderation from recent high growth, acknowledges increasing scale and potential macroeconomic headwinds, and is more conservative than the market's implied rate.

8.  **Margin Path:** The TTM operating margin is 33.26%. The average operating margin for the last three full fiscal years (2022-2024) is approximately 29.4%. I will use a **constant operating margin of 31.0%** for the forecast period, slightly below the TTM level to be conservative but above the 3-year average to reflect recent efficiency gains.

9.  **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is 18.88%. I will use a **normalized effective tax rate of 20.0%** for the forecast, closer to historical norms and accounting for potential changes in global tax regulations.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex is 1.35% of revenue ($338M / $25,025M). I will assume **Capex remains at 1.4% of revenue.**
    *   **Working Capital:** TTM Change in WC is 4.5% of revenue. I will model **Change in Working Capital as 4.0% of *incremental* revenue**, reflecting historical efficiency.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** This is a real cost and will be subtracted from FCFF. I will model it as **2.0% of revenue**, slightly below the TTM level of 2.4% ($612M / $25,025M) as large companies often manage this down as a percentage of sales over time.
    *   **Share Count:** The diluted share count has decreased from ~41M in 2021 to 33M TTM, roughly a 5-6% annual reduction. The company has a significant share repurchase program. I will assume a **net annual share count reduction of 3.0%** going forward, a conservative estimate compared to the recent historical trend.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**
| Year | 1 (2026) | 2 (2027) | 3 (2028) | 4 (2029) | 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $28,028 | $30,971 | $33,913 | $36,626 | $38,824 |
| *Growth Rate* | *12.0%* | *10.5%* | *9.5%* | *8.0%* | *6.0%* |
| EBIT (31.0% margin) | $8,689 | $9,601 | $10,513 | $11,354 | $12,035 |
| NOPAT (20% tax) | $6,951 | $7,681 | $8,410 | $9,083 | $9,628 |
| D&A (3.1% of Rev) | $869 | $960 | $1,051 | $1,135 | $1,204 |
| SBC (2.0% of Rev) | ($561) | ($619) | ($678) | ($733) | ($776) |
| Capex (1.4% of Rev) | ($392) | ($434) | ($475) | ($513) | ($544) |
| Change in WC | ($120) | ($118) | ($118) | ($108) | ($88) |
| **FCFF** | **$6,747** | **$7,470** | **$8,190** | **$8,864** | **$9,424** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.26%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of Aug 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.).
    *   Beta: **1.20** (Revised). The original 5-year beta of 1.41 is high and likely influenced by post-pandemic volatility. As a market leader, Booking's long-term systematic risk should be closer to the market. A beta of 1.20 is a more normalized and realistic assumption for a mature-stage growth company in a cyclical industry.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.20 * 5.0% = 10.26%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   The implied rate of 9.77% is unrealistic. A **5.5%** pre-tax cost of debt is a more reasonable estimate for an investment-grade company of this scale.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.5% * (1 - 20.0%) = 4.40%**

16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   *Correction Note:* The original report contained a calculation error (`10.25 + 0.41 = 9.61`). The following is the corrected calculation with the revised Beta.
    *   Market Value of Equity (E): $188,789M
    *   Market Value of Debt (D): $19,239M
    *   **WACC = (E/(E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D/(E+D)) * After-Tax Cost of Debt**
    *   **WACC = (188,789/208,028) * 10.26% + (19,239/208,028) * 4.40% = 9.31% + 0.41% = 9.72%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Gordon Growth Method (as a check):**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**, reflecting long-term sustainable global economic growth and inflation.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   Terminal Value = ($9,424 * (1.025)) / (9.72% - 2.5%) = $9,659.6 / 0.0722 = **$133,790M**

18. **Exit Multiple Method (Primary Method):**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA: $12,035M (EBIT) + $1,204M (D&A) = $13,239M
    *   **Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple from Gordon Growth:** $133,790M / $13,239M = **10.1x**
    *   *Analysis:* The original report correctly identified that its GGM-implied multiple (8.9x) was too low. With our revised, more realistic WACC, the implied multiple is now a more plausible 10.1x. However, for a high-quality, capital-light market leader like Booking, this is still on the conservative side. Historically, the company and its sector have commanded multiples in the 12x-15x range. A **12.0x exit multiple** strikes a realistic balance: it is higher than the conservative GGM implies, acknowledging the company's quality, but it is below historical peaks, reflecting a transition to a more mature growth phase.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple Method) = $13,239M * 12.0 = $158,868M**
    *   This figure will be used for the final valuation as it better reflects realistic market expectations for a best-in-class company at the end of the forecast period.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: ($6,747/1.0972^1) + ($7,470/1.0972^2) + ($8,190/1.0972^3) + ($8,864/1.0972^4) + ($9,424/1.0972^5) = $6,149 + $6,236 + $6,231 + $6,158 + $5,930 = **$30,704M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: $158,868M / (1.0972^5) = **$99,848M**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $30,704M + $99,848M = $130,552M**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = $130,552M (Enterprise Value) - ($19,239M Debt - $17,595M Cash)
    *   **Equity Value = $130,552M - $1,644M (Net Debt) = $128,908M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Initial Diluted Shares: 33.0M
    *   Projected Year 5 Shares (with 3.0% annual reduction): 33.0 * (1 - 0.03)^5 = **28.3M shares**
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $128,908M / 28.3M shares = $4,555.05**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $4,555.05**
    *   **Low/Bear Case (~$3,650):** Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 8% tapering to 4%), margin compression to 28%, and a lower exit multiple of 10.5x, reflecting a recessionary environment.
    *   **High/Bull Case (~$5,800):** Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 15% tapering to 8%), slight margin expansion to 33%, and a higher exit multiple of 13.5x, reflecting continued market share gains and a strong travel market.

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% margin of safety below the base-case estimate provides a buffer against forecasting errors.
    *   **MOS Price = $4,555.05 * (1 - 0.25) = $3,416.29**

**Risk Notes**

The primary risks to this valuation include: 1) **Increased Competition:** Aggressive competition from platforms like Google Travel, Airbnb, and Expedia could pressure take rates and marketing efficiency. 2) **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a travel company, Booking is highly susceptible to economic downturns, which reduce discretionary consumer spending. 3) **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Particularly in Europe, regulations like the Digital Markets Act (DMA) could impact business practices and profitability. 4) **Geopolitical Instability:** Conflicts or global health crises can severely disrupt global travel patterns.

final answer is 4555.05 $
