### **2) Top 3 Prioritized Catalysts (Summary Table)**

| Catalyst Title | Type | Timing Window | Impact (Small/Medium/Large + % range) | Probability (0–100%) | One-Line Evidence Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Accelerated Share Repurchase Execution** | Corporate Action | 0-12 months | Medium (+10-20%) | 75% | $500M buyback program refreshed June 21, 2024, with ~$495M remaining. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025) |

### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Accelerated Share Repurchase Execution**
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Darling's Board authorized a $500 million share repurchase program, which was refreshed on June 21, 2024, and is valid through August 13, 2026. As of the end of fiscal 2024, approximately $494.9 million remained available under this authorization. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   **Mechanism:** Aggressively deploying the remaining buyback authorization would reduce the share count, directly increasing EPS. This signals management's belief that the stock is undervalued and provides a direct return of capital to shareholders, likely leading to a higher share price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026. The program is active and can be executed at management's discretion.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Repurchase of $150 million. At an assumed average price of $35/share, this retires ~4.3 million shares, or ~2.7% of the 159.0 million shares outstanding as of August 2, 2024. (Form 10-Q, Aug 2, 2024)
    *   **Base Case:** Repurchase of $300 million. At an assumed average price of $35/share, this retires ~8.6 million shares, or ~5.4% of shares outstanding.
    *   **High Case:** Repurchase of the full remaining $495 million. At an assumed average price of $35/share, this retires ~14.1 million shares, or ~8.9% of shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). A significant reduction in share count by 5-9% should lead to a corresponding increase in per-share value, amplified by improved market sentiment.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The program is authorized and funded. The degree of execution is the main variable and depends on market conditions and competing uses for cash.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Share price remaining at levels management deems attractive; sufficient free cash flow generation; no large, immediate M&A opportunities that would divert capital.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports (Form 10-Q/K) under "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities."
    *   Cash Flow Statement: "Repurchase of common stock" line item.
    *   Press releases announcing accelerated share repurchase (ASR) programs.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A large acquisition diverts cash planned for buybacks.
    *   A significant operational downturn reduces available free cash flow.
    *   Recent selling by the CEO could signal a lack of urgency to repurchase shares. (Insider Filings, Aug 2025)
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases in the upcoming quarterly filings as a key indicator of management's confidence and capital allocation priorities.

**2. Catalyst Title: Diamond Green Diesel (DGD) Margin Recovery**
*   **Type:** Financial / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Darling's share of its DGD joint venture's EBITDA fell to approximately $42.6 million in Q2 2025, down from $76.6 million in Q2 2024, due to a challenging renewable fuel environment. (Q2 2025 Transcript, Jul 24, 2025) A recovery in renewable diesel (RD) pricing, lower feedstock costs (like soybean oil), and higher values for government credits (RINs, LCFS) could restore profitability.
*   **Mechanism:** DGD is a significant contributor to Darling's earnings. A recovery in the spread between RD prices and feedstock costs, driven by stronger demand or more favorable government incentives, would directly increase the "Equity in net income of Diamond Green Diesel" on Darling's income statement, boosting overall profitability and cash flow.
*   **Timing:** 6–12 months. Dependent on market and regulatory factors.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Darling's share of DGD EBITDA remains depressed at a ~$200 million annual run-rate. (Derived from $48.7M in H1 2025). (Q2 2025 Transcript, Jul 24, 2025)
    *   **Base Case:** Margins recover partially, leading to a ~$400 million annual run-rate for Darling's share of DGD EBITDA.
    *   **High Case:** Margins return to levels seen in prior years, approaching the ~$739 million annual run-rate implied by H1 2023 results ($361.7M reported for nine months 2023). (Form 10-Q, Nov 1, 2024)
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A recovery to the H1 2023 earnings run-rate would add over $500 million in pre-tax earnings to Darling annually, which would have a dramatic positive impact on valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 50%. This catalyst is highly dependent on volatile commodity markets and unpredictable government policy (e.g., EPA's setting of RFS volumes).
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Higher prices for LCFS credits and RINs.
    *   Favorable pricing for renewable diesel relative to feedstock costs.
    *   Clarity and favorable implementation of the Clean Fuels Production Credit (CFPC), which replaced the blender's tax credit in January 2025. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   CME Soybean Oil Futures prices.
    *   California LCFS credit prices (reported by CARB).
    *   EPA announcements on RFS volume obligations.
    *   Darling's quarterly earnings releases (Equity in net income of DGD).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   EPA sets lower-than-expected RFS blending mandates.
    *   A surge in feedstock prices (soybean oil, tallow) compresses margins.
    *   An oversupply of renewable diesel from new competing projects pressures prices.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a high-impact but uncertain catalyst. Investors should monitor key DGD margin indicators closely.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title: Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) Production Ramp & Offtake Agreements**
*   **Type:** Product / Partnership
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The DGD Port Arthur plant completed a project in November 2024 enabling it to upgrade approximately 50% of its 470 million gallon annual renewable diesel capacity to Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025) As airlines globally seek to decarbonize, securing long-term, high-value offtake agreements for this SAF capacity will be a major long-term growth driver.
*   **Mechanism:** SAF is a key solution for decarbonizing aviation and is expected to command premium pricing over renewable diesel, supported by government incentives and corporate demand. As Darling and Valero lock in long-term sales contracts with major airlines, it will de-risk the DGD business and provide a clear, high-margin growth trajectory, leading to a higher valuation for DAR.
*   **Timing:** 12–60 months. Production capability is online; securing long-term contracts will occur over this period.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Plausible Scenario:** DGD dedicates 235 million gallons (50% of Port Arthur capacity) to SAF production.
    *   **Revenue Impact:** Assuming a conservative SAF price premium of $1.00/gallon over renewable diesel, this would generate an additional $235 million in annual revenue for the DGD joint venture.
    *   **EBITDA Impact:** Assuming a 50% margin on the premium, this translates to an additional ~$117.5 million in annual EBITDA for DGD, or ~$58.8 million for Darling's 50% share. This is likely conservative as government incentives (e.g., under the Inflation Reduction Act) could drive margins higher.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). The market is forward-looking. Announcing a major, multi-year offtake agreement with a flagship airline would validate the SAF strategy and likely cause a significant re-rating of the stock, as the market prices in a new, durable, high-growth earnings stream.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The production asset is complete and the demand for SAF from the aviation industry is structurally strong and growing. The primary variable is the timing and pricing of offtake agreements.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Favorable long-term government support for SAF (e.g., IRA tax credits); continued commitment from airlines to decarbonization goals; scaling of logistics to handle jet fuel.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Company press releases announcing SAF offtake agreements.
    *   Airline industry news on SAF procurement.
    *   Quarterly earnings call commentary on SAF production volumes and pricing.
    *   Updates on the implementation of the SAF tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Delays in policy implementation or less favorable-than-expected tax credit guidance.
    *   Airlines slowing their decarbonization investments due to economic downturns.
    *   New, more cost-effective SAF production pathways emerge from competitors (e.g., alcohol-to-jet).
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is a credible, high-impact, long-term catalyst. The investment has been made, and the market demand is structurally sound, providing a clear path to value creation.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**Catalyst 1: DGD Margin Recovery**
*   **Logic:** A return to historical profitability for the DGD segment would significantly increase Darling's earnings.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Darling Enterprise Value (EV): ~$9.0B (Inference based on market cap + debt)
    *   Current Darling Adj. EBITDA (ex-DGD): ~$800M (Inference from recent performance)
    *   Depressed DGD EBITDA (DAR's share): ~$200M (H1 2025 run-rate)
    *   Recovered DGD EBITDA (DAR's share): ~$600M (Midpoint between depressed and peak levels)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   *Current Implied EV/EBITDA:* $9.0B / ($800M + $200M) = 9.0x
    *   *Valuation with Recovered DGD:* ($800M Core + $600M DGD) * 9.0x EV/EBITDA = $12.6B EV
    *   *Implied Equity Upside:* ($12.6B New EV - $9.0B Current EV) / ~$5.8B Market Cap = **~62% upside**
*   **Citation:** DGD EBITDA figures inferred from Q2 2025 earnings call transcript. (Q2 2025 Transcript, Jul 24, 2025)

**Catalyst 2: Accelerated Share Repurchase**
*   **Logic:** Executing the full buyback reduces share count and increases EPS, which should lead to a higher share price, all else equal.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Shares Outstanding: 159.0 million (Form 10-Q, Aug 2, 2024)
    *   Remaining Buyback Authorization: $494.9 million (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
    *   Assumed Repurchase Price: $35/share
    *   Current Share Price: ~$31/share
*   **Calculation:**
    *   *Shares Repurchased:* $494.9M / $35/share = 14.14 million shares
    *   *New Share Count:* 159.0M - 14.14M = 144.86 million shares
    *   *Share Count Reduction:* 14.14M / 159.0M = 8.9%
    *   *Direct Price Impact (holding EV constant):* A ~9% reduction in shares should lead to a ~9% increase in share price to maintain the same equity value. However, the strong signal of a large buyback often adds a premium.
    *   *Estimated Price Impact:* **10-15%** (direct impact plus improved sentiment).

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term (0-12 months) catalyst balance for Darling Ingredients appears **cautiously positive**. The primary positive driver is the significant capacity remaining on the share repurchase program, which provides a tangible tool for management to support the stock and enhance per-share value. Continued margin stability in the core Feed and Food segments provides a solid foundation. However, this is weighed against the significant uncertainty surrounding the profitability of the DGD joint venture, which has been a major drag on recent results. The market signal is therefore mixed; a decisive upward move in the stock likely requires a tangible improvement in DGD's profitability or an aggressive deployment of the share buyback.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Sustained Collapse in Biofuel Margins:** A prolonged period of low renewable fuel prices combined with high feedstock costs could render the DGD segment unprofitable, wiping out a major earnings contributor and negating any positive momentum from the core business. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
2.  **Adverse Regulatory Changes:** The repeal or significant weakening of key biofuel mandates like the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) or California's Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) would severely damage the economics of the entire renewable diesel and SAF industry. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
3.  **Major Animal Disease Outbreak:** An outbreak of a disease like African Swine Fever (ASF) or a highly pathogenic Avian Influenza in North America could devastate raw material supply for the core Feed and Food segments, leading to plant shutdowns and severe volume reductions. (Form 10-K, Feb 25, 2025)

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

**Watch.** The investment thesis for Darling Ingredients hinges on the recovery of its highly impactful but currently underperforming Diamond Green Diesel segment. While the long-term potential of Sustainable Aviation Fuel is a powerful structural catalyst, and the active share repurchase program provides a near-term floor, the stock is unlikely to materially re-rate higher until there is clear evidence of a turnaround in biofuel margins. The single most important indicator to monitor is the spread between renewable diesel prices and soybean oil futures, as this is the primary driver of DGD profitability.
