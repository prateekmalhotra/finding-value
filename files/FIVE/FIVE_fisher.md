**Five Below, Inc. Analysis (August 21, 2025)**

Company: Five Below, Inc. (FIVE)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K (FYE February 1, 2025), Q1 2025 Earnings Release (Quarter Ended May 3, 2025), and Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (June 4, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below has a clear growth plan centered on expanding its physical footprint. The company intends to grow its store base from 1,771 locations (as of February 1, 2025) to a stated long-term potential of over 3,500 stores in the U.S.. For fiscal 2025 alone, the company plans to open approximately 150 new stores and is guiding for a comparable sales increase between 3% and 5%, indicating continued strong demand from its target market.. This dual strategy of new unit expansion and positive same-store sales growth points to a substantial runway for increased sales.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below's business model is built on continuous product and process development. Management's strategy is to offer a "dynamic, edited assortment of trend-right" merchandise that changes frequently to drive repeat visits. The company has also expanded its price points with the "Five Beyond" store-within-a-store concept. Furthermore, it is making significant capital investments in its supply chain, having recently built and expanded several large distribution centers to support its aggressive store growth, demonstrating a commitment to developing its operational processes..
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a retailer, "R&D" is best measured by the effectiveness of its merchandising, sourcing, and product development functions. Five Below’s model relies on quickly identifying and sourcing "trend-right" products for its teen and tween demographic, a process that appears highly effective given its growth. The strong financial performance, including a 19.5% year-over-year revenue increase and a 7.1% comparable sales increase reported in Q1 2025, serves as direct evidence of the success of its product selection and merchandising strategies.. While the company does not report specific R&D metrics, its results indicate a highly effective "R&D" function relative to its size in the retail industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below’s sales organization, comprising its store operations and marketing, demonstrates above-average performance through its powerful new store economics. The company's new store model achieves an average payback period of approximately one year on an initial investment of about $0.4 million, which is exceptionally strong. This is supported by robust recent performance, such as the 7.1% comparable sales increase in Q1 2025. The company's marketing leverages social media to build brand awareness effectively with its target demographic, further driving traffic and sales..
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGSm6kH-Nn49_qlX91JkLUQ1L_ku8et6nStLTTh03ctmnmBNRvF5eK77PJRRqjwnImTye2HTWh4G1f-XoF7tgvhovmQUOxM0BwinRxtcj8u1isxcnXHhfxNlu0tMoH_pw57-13vHWCLy8xCslwIsMe2RCTbiRGGPpFn5SAMlTgjmlNOJvoVC6JDlQEZ-ZD13nD-k6tIkEY3D1WniXCWTK1VuAhDQzXza_zumQbnCztjFAwcAeQ3fitdLqmwAd8iSOhfcMBn2KNL_nEDpeI=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGSm6kH-Nn49_qlX91JkLUQ1L_ku8et6nStLTTh03ctmnmBNRvF5eK77PJRRqjwnImTye2HTWh4G1f-XoF7tgvhovmQUOxM0BwinRxtcj8u1isxcnXHhfxNlu0tMoH_pw57-13vHWCLy8xCslwIsMe2RCTbiRGGPpFn5SAMlTgjmlNOJvoVC6JDlQEZ-ZD13nD-k6tIkEY3D1WniXCWTK1VuAhDQzXza_zumQbnCztjFAwcAeQ3fitdLqmwAd8iSOhfcMBn2KNL_nEDpeI=) (June 4, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below's profit margins are solid for a discount retailer but are facing pressure. In fiscal 2024, the company reported a gross margin of 34.9% and an operating margin of 8.4%. This was a decline from fiscal 2023's operating margin of 10.8%. The Q1 2025 earnings call transcript noted the company anticipates operating margin compression for the full year due to rising costs. While profitable, the declining trend and future guidance suggest margins are not currently "worthwhile" in the context of Fisher's preference for stable or expanding margins.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=) (June 4, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is taking actions to support margins, such as enhancing supply chain efficiencies and managing inventory shrink. However, these efforts are being offset by significant headwinds. The Q1 2025 earnings call transcript explicitly states that the company anticipates operating margin compression of approximately 200 basis points for the full year, driven by higher incentive compensation costs and investments in store labor. Because the net effect of the company's actions is a forecast of margin decline, the evidence does not support a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=) (June 4, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed information on its human capital strategy, emphasizing a positive work environment. Notably, none of its approximately 23,200 employees are part of a union or collective bargaining agreement. Five Below conducts an annual crew survey with Gallup, and it reports that its overall engagement levels "continue to outperform the Gallup Retail Industry Company Database Levels in the United States," which is a strong third-party validation of positive employee relations. The company also details a comprehensive "Total Rewards" benefits package.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been notable recent turnover in the executive ranks. Winnie Park assumed the role of CEO in December 2024. Subsequently, the company announced the departure of CFO Kristy Chipman in its Q1 2025 earnings release on June 4, 2025. While leadership changes are not inherently negative, such turnover at the highest levels within a short period does not align with Fisher's ideal of stable, long-tenured, and outstanding executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=) (June 4, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K lists its executive officers beyond the CEO, including heads of Retail, Merchandising, Legal, HR, and IT. However, the recent and impending departure of the CFO, a key leadership position, raises questions about management depth and succession planning. Public filings do not provide sufficient detail about the next layer of management or specific succession plans to confidently assess the bench strength as deep.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEgDrJp_7Q1t8yCpUOgHv1KgMOo2M91jH27aRIvFywE317rXlhxx3PKAawWJYAQ94ex-CjL4mzmAdracg5wOxur420SaCZ5-WEK8UmcJImVhTACvsRp4FELh-2t4BLrzmyV08GYXllVNyGhJgVVfEwUH7U=) (June 4, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, contains an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP. Furthermore, the report includes management's assertion that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of the same date. There is no history of significant restatements or disclosed material weaknesses, indicating that the company's accounting controls are sound and reliable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The most important clue for Five Below is its powerful and defensible brand niche. Unlike general discount stores, it has cultivated a specific identity focused on the "tween and teen" demographic with a high-energy, "treasure hunt" shopping experience. This focus on a specific customer segment with "trend-right" and constantly rotating merchandise creates a destination status that broader competitors like Dollar General or Dollar Tree cannot easily replicate. The success of its new store model, with paybacks around one year, is a direct result of this differentiated strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently prioritizes long-term growth over short-term profit maximization. The central corporate strategy is aggressive store expansion, with a goal to more than double the current store count. This requires significant capital expenditures, with a budget of $210 million to $230 million for fiscal 2025, to fund new stores and infrastructure. This commitment to reinvestment, even while forecasting near-term operating margin compression, is a clear indication of a long-range outlook focused on capturing market share and building a larger, more profitable enterprise in the future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGSm6kH-Nn49_qlX91JkLUQ1L_ku8et6nStLTTh03ctmnmBNRvF5eK77PJRRqjwnImTye2HTWh4G1f-XoF7tgvhovmQUOxM0BwinRxtcj8u1isxcnXHhfxNlu0tMoH_pw57-13vHWCLy8xCslwIsMe2RCTbiRGGPpFn5SAMlTgjmlNOJvoVC6JDlQEZ-ZD13nD-k6tIkEY3D1WniXCWTK1VuAhDQzXza_zumQbnCztjFAwcAeQ3fitdLqmwAd8iSOhfcMBn2KNL_nEDpeI=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGSm6kH-Nn49_qlX91JkLUQ1L_ku8et6nStLTTh03ctmnmBNRvF5eK77PJRRqjwnImTye2HTWh4G1f-XoF7tgvhovmQUOxM0BwinRxtcj8u1isxcnXHhfxNlu0tMoH_pw57-13vHWCLy8xCslwIsMe2RCTbiRGGPpFn5SAMlTgjmlNOJvoVC6JDlQEZ-ZD13nD-k6tIkEY3D1WniXCWTK1VuAhDQzXza_zumQbnCztjFAwcAeQ3fitdLqmwAd8iSOhfcMBn2KNL_nEDpeI=) (June 4, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong, debt-free balance sheet. As of February 1, 2025, Five Below held $331.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and $197.1 million in short-term investments, with no debt outstanding. For fiscal 2024, it generated $430.6 million in cash from operations. The company is actively repurchasing shares, having bought back $40 million in stock in fiscal 2024, demonstrating that its capital allocation strategy is returning cash to shareholders, not seeking new equity from them. This financial strength is more than sufficient to fund its planned capital expenditures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 19, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, executives discussed both strong top-line results and the specific challenges leading to a forecast of operating margin compression, citing investments in labor and higher incentive compensation costs. They also openly announced the transition of their CFO. This willingness to discuss challenges and negative trends alongside positive results meets Fisher's standard for transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is facing a securities class-action lawsuit filed in August 2024, alleging that management made materially false and misleading statements regarding the company's growth plan and ability to capitalize on trends. While Five Below states in its 10-K that it believes the lawsuit is "without merit," the existence of such a claim, which directly questions management's representations to investors, prevents the conclusion that integrity is "unquestionable.".
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Five Below scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, strong financial footing, unique market niche, and excellent labor relations. The company's primary strength lies in its aggressive but proven store expansion strategy, funded entirely by internal cash flow. However, the analysis reveals significant concerns in two key areas: profitability and management stability. The forecast for operating margin compression in fiscal 2025 is a material negative, suggesting that cost pressures are currently outpacing efficiency initiatives. The recent turnover in both the CEO and CFO roles, combined with a pending securities lawsuit, raises questions about executive stability and integrity. The score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on two factors: first, a reversal of the negative margin trend, which would require evidence of stabilizing labor and supply chain costs; and second, a favorable resolution of the class-action lawsuit and a period of stability within the C-suite. A full fiscal year of positive operating leverage would be the most critical evidence to flip the "No" on margins to a "Yes".

fisher score is 10 / 15
