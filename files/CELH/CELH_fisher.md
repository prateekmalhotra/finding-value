 Company, August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius Holdings operates in the growing global energy drink market, with a strong position in the expanding "healthy, functional" sub-segment. The company's market share in the U.S. energy drink category reached a combined 16.2% with the acquisition of Alani Nu in the first quarter of 2025. International expansion is a key growth driver, with a 41% increase in international sales reported. The company is also entering new product categories, such as the $1.4 billion hydration powder market with its CELSIUS HYDRATION line, indicating a strategy to broaden its addressable market beyond traditional energy drinks.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius has demonstrated a strong commitment to product innovation. Recent launches include new fizz-free flavors, Pink Lemonade and Dragon Fruit Lime, and the CELSIUS HYDRATION line. The acquisition of Alani Nu in April 2025 also diversifies the company's product portfolio and consumer base, targeting a different demographic. Management has explicitly stated that product innovation is a cornerstone of its long-term growth strategy, focusing on evolving consumer preferences for healthier beverage options.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius does not explicitly break out R&D spending in its financial statements, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, its effectiveness can be inferred from the successful launch of new products and flavors that drive incremental sales, such as the Sherbet Swirl and Cotton Candy flavors from the acquired Alani Nu brand. The company's innovation is closely tied to its marketing strategy, using influencer collaborations and social media campaigns to expand reach and brand engagement. The lack of specific R&D metrics prevents a definitive "Yes."
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius benefits from a powerful distribution network, significantly enhanced by its agreement with PepsiCo. This partnership provides access to a vast network of retailers and food service locations. The company is expanding its presence in various channels, with new placements in over 18,000 Subway locations and 1,800 Home Depot stores. The rapid growth in market share, with Celsius alone accounting for 50% of the growth in the US energy drink market by 2024, is a strong indicator of an effective sales and distribution strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. The company's gross margin was reported at 51.5% and 52.3% in recent reports, an improvement from the previous year. The adjusted EBITDA margin was approximately 21%. These margins are healthy for the beverage industry and indicate operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gross margin has been expanding due to lower production costs and better purchasing terms. The integration of the Big Beverages facility is expected to enhance supply chain efficiency and support scaling. Additionally, the operational leadership from PepsiCo is anticipated to further improve supply chain management. These actions demonstrate a focus on operational efficiency to drive margin improvement.

Without credible, recent evidence on this point, it is not possible to assess the quality of their labor relations.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The hiring of operational leadership from PepsiCo suggests a strategic move to bring in experienced talent to manage growth.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has been strengthening its management team, notably by bringing in executives with experience from PepsiCo to manage its supply chain and operations. This move suggests an effort to build a team capable of handling the company's rapid scaling. However, detailed information on the broader management team beyond the top executives is not readily available in the provided sources.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's ability to improve gross margins through lower production costs and better purchasing terms suggests effective cost analysis. However, a thorough assessment would require a review of the auditor's opinion and any remarks on internal controls within the 10-K, which is not available in the provided search results.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius has successfully built a strong brand identity around a "healthy, functional" image, which resonates with current consumer trends. The "LIVE FIT" campaign and alignment with health-conscious consumers differentiate it from traditional, high-sugar energy drinks. This brand positioning, combined with its powerful distribution network, gives Celsius a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's focus on international expansion, product innovation, and increased marketing investment suggests a long-range outlook. The acquisition of Alani Nu for $1.8 billion, despite concerns about increased debt, is a strategic move to bolster future growth. The company appears willing to make significant investments to capture market share and build a durable brand, prioritizing long-term growth over short-term profitability.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a "healthy financial balance sheet," which, combined with strong gross margins and a positive EBITDA margin, suggests it can internally fund some of its growth. However, the recent $1.8 billion acquisition of Alani Nu raises concerns about increased debt.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has communicated through periods of both strong performance and challenges. It acknowledged disappointing results in 2024, which led to a significant stock price decline, but has since reported a recovery and a turnaround in revenue. This indicates a willingness to communicate during difficult periods. A full assessment would require reviewing multiple earnings call transcripts over time.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the provided sources to suggest any issues with management's integrity, such as legal or regulatory problems, related-party transactions, or governance red flags. However, without a detailed review of proxy statements and legal filings, it is impossible to confirm this definitively.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Celsius Holdings scores positively on several key growth-oriented factors in Fisher's framework. The company's strengths lie in its well-positioned products within the expanding functional beverage market, a clear commitment to innovation, and a powerful sales and distribution organization bolstered by its PepsiCo partnership. Furthermore, Celsius has demonstrated the ability to generate worthwhile and improving profit margins. The primary areas of uncertainty, leading to "No" answers, stem from a lack of detailed public disclosures on R&D metrics, labor relations, management depth, and accounting controls—information typically found in detailed SEC filings not fully analyzed here.

Over the next 12-24 months, the score is most likely to be influenced by three variables: the successful integration and continued growth of the recently acquired Alani Nu brand, the pace and profitability of its international expansion, and its ability to manage the balance sheet and cash flow to fund growth without significant shareholder dilution. To flip the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to provide more granular disclosure on R&D spending and effectiveness, offer transparency into human capital metrics, and provide a clean auditor's opinion on internal controls in its annual report.

fisher score is 8 / 15
