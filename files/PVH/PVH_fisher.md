Company, PVH Corp. (PVH); date of analysis, August 23, 2025; primary sources reviewed, FY2024 10-K, Q1 2025 10-Q, Q1 2025 earnings call transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**  
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH's core brands, *Tommy Hilfiger* and *Calvin Klein*, are globally recognized, with over 70% of revenue generated internationally, suggesting broad market penetration. The company's multi-year "PVH+ Plan" is designed to drive long-term growth by enhancing these brands. However, recent performance and outlook are modest; revenue grew 2% in Q1 2025, and the full-year 2025 forecast is for revenue to be "flat to increase slightly." While the strategy to bring licensed businesses in-house presents a growth avenue, the current trajectory does not support the expectation of a "sizable" increase in sales against its ~$9 billion base in a challenging macroeconomic environment.  
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment is centered on the PVH+ Plan, a strategic framework focused on winning with product, consumer engagement, and a digitally-led marketplace. Evidence of this includes recent product launches, such as the Calvin Klein "Icon Cotton Stretch" franchise, which was amplified by a viral marketing campaign. The plan also involves process development, such as expanding the use of 3D design technology to shorten lead times and bringing key licensed product categories in-house to directly control and grow them.  
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an apparel company, PVH's research and development is focused on design, merchandising, and supply chain innovation rather than traditional R&D. The company's 10-K mentions using 3D design to accelerate its go-to-market calendar. However, the company does not disclose specific metrics, such as R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, that would allow for a quantitative comparison of its effectiveness relative to its size or peers. Without concrete data on outputs or efficiency, its effectiveness cannot be verified.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm) (filed April 1, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales performance is mixed across regions and channels, indicating an inconsistent, rather than "above-average," sales function. In Q1 2025, EMEA showed growth in both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels, but the Americas DTC business declined, and the entire APAC segment saw a 13% revenue decrease. While total wholesale revenue grew 6% and e-commerce grew 3%, the 5% decline in brick-and-mortar retail store sales points to significant challenges. A Morningstar analysis notes that PVH "has failed to connect with North American consumers as well as some peers have," further questioning the sales organization's overall effectiveness.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm) (filed June 4, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFOgZQf1fLm1-xo8cEee0Ufn5jSfc9ui3KcvottHQZ_9AvSHNAk4ZndiVE4gxmNpJ851m-yvxJSS249t_HNfXiII6ha_nINeG4DE6gQl3CMGeolCPDpMKfbgJ2rKBb0jJEasZQz6_kQrzn9y87z6JNnUpzBjY-Dh60LewGu2DjRGONrbavB6thjrocz9aWTGlB7] (June 5, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHdtWt4JAj2l9cpgN4Z0NhbkISGOTwgTJRB2OD3UeaB3YDa4XoNGiOSyz5iNP9mJwepuSJqApQo9qU1rVFYIT-hxj_--LMvwjGcd6GOxDeba0YSJ3w8D3k9jNaI38rp8Rj2lzyFmVBwv6AZD3tbkHpbX5H-MnBvOxEpn4-17UN9TwtbRRWqWn9vSaCrEQfbM1hOTFPLOAPDPhozNh_ATD88zNd4iDoopfHGbNIS2UI4kyU1YjWF6NOHtODEE5NTW8BOdgGX-oE=] (June 5, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** PVH achieved a gross margin of 59.4% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 10.0% in fiscal 2024. However, margins are under pressure, with Q1 2025 gross margin falling 280 basis points to 58.6%. The company has updated its full-year 2025 operating margin forecast downward to approximately 8.5% from a previous outlook of around 10.0%, citing tariff impacts and a promotional environment. This declining profitability trend suggests its margins are not consistently worthwhile, especially when compared to competitors who may have stronger pricing power.  
**Answer:** No

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively pursuing margin improvement through its "Growth Driver 5 Actions," a multi-year initiative to simplify its operating model. This plan is expected to generate $200 million to $300 million in annual cost savings by 2026. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, management highlighted that these cost-saving actions contributed to a 90 basis point SG&A improvement versus the prior year and that benefits are expected to grow. This demonstrates a clear and quantified strategy to improve profitability through cost efficiencies.  
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company states in its 10-K that "relations with our associates are good," and notes that only a small fraction (~1%) of its workforce is unionized. PVH is actively hiring for roles like "Employee Relations Director" to implement strategy across its regions. Third-party sources like Comparably give the company's culture a "B" grade, with employees rating the environment positively. While there are no visible signs of major labor strife, the available evidence supports a finding of "good" rather than "outstanding" personnel relations.  
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team has experienced notable turnover. While CEO Stefan Larsson has been in his role since 2021, other key positions have changed recently. The company appointed a new Chief Executive Officer, PVH EMEA in December 2024, a new Global Brand President for *Tommy Hilfiger* in April 2024, a new Chief Executive Officer, PVH Americas in October 2024, and a new Chief People Officer in February 2024. Such significant changes across top regional, brand, and functional leadership roles in a short period do not suggest outstanding stability in executive relations.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm) (filed April 1, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K lists nine executive officers in addition to the CEO. This team includes leaders for its major regions (Americas, EMEA), its two global brands (*Tommy Hilfiger*, *Calvin Klein*), and key corporate functions like Finance, Legal, People, and Operations/Supply Chain. This structure demonstrates a clear delegation of authority and functional expertise beyond the CEO, indicating sufficient management depth to run a complex global organization.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm) (filed April 1, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's accounting controls have a significant, disclosed deficiency. In its FY 2024 10-K, management concluded that internal control over financial reporting was "not effective" due to a "material weakness" related to ineffective information technology general controls in the EMEA region. The company's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an adverse audit report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of February 2, 2025. Such a finding represents a serious lapse in accounting controls.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000018/pvh-20250202.htm) (filed April 1, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the apparel industry, brand equity is a crucial indicator of competitive strength. PVH's two core brands, *Calvin Klein* and *Tommy Hilfiger*, are described in filings as "global iconic lifestyle brands" that together generated over 90% of the company's revenue. However, despite their scale, a 2024 Morningstar analysis concluded that "neither of PVH's major brands has the pricing power or competitiveness to provide an economic moat." The analysis also noted struggles in connecting with North American consumers compared to peers, suggesting that while the brands are valuable assets, they are not currently demonstrating an "outstanding" competitive edge.  
**Answer:** No

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a long-range outlook through its PVH+ Plan, described as a "multi-year, strategic plan." A key part of this plan involves bringing licensed product categories from G-III in-house; the company explicitly stated this transition would cause a 50 basis point decline in gross margin in 2025, a short-term cost for the long-term benefit of direct control. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, the CFO discussed taking "proactive measures, including investing in cut-through marketing campaigns and delivering increasing cost efficiencies" to "improve our trajectory in the second half." This willingness to invest and absorb near-term margin impact for future improvement is a hallmark of a long-range view.  
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively reducing its share count, not issuing new equity. The Board of Directors has authorized a $5.0 billion stock repurchase program running through July 2028. In April 2025, the company entered into a $500 million accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreement, a strong signal against dilution. The balance sheet as of May 4, 2025, shows $191 million in cash and significant long-term debt, but the company's cash from operations and access to credit facilities appear sufficient to fund operations, capital expenditures, and shareholder returns without needing to issue stock.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78239/000007823925000052/pvh-20250504.htm) (filed June 4, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its communications. In the Q1 2025 earnings release and call, the company directly addressed a 280-basis-point drop in gross margin, attributing it to a wholesale revenue mix shift, increased promotions, and freight costs related to product delays. They also openly discussed the "challenging consumer environment" in the APAC region and acknowledged the negative impact of U.S. tariffs, which led them to lower their full-year EPS outlook. This transparency about both operational missteps and external headwinds shows a commitment to keeping investors well-informed.  
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is a significant, ongoing issue that calls management's standing into question. In February 2025, China's Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) placed PVH Corp. on its "List of Unreliable Entities." The investigation relates to suspicions that the company took discriminatory measures regarding products from China's Xinjiang region. This action poses a material risk to the ~6% of revenue generated in China and represents a major international regulatory and ethical challenge. While the company has a formal Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, this major governmental sanction prevents an assessment of "unquestionable integrity."  
**Answer:** No

---  
**Synthesis:**  
PVH Corp.'s primary strengths through a Fisher lens are its clear long-term strategy (PVH+ Plan), shareholder-friendly capital allocation via buybacks, and candid investor communications. Management is taking identifiable steps to improve margins through cost savings and is willing to absorb short-term pain for long-range gain, such as bringing licensed businesses in-house. However, the company scores poorly on several critical points. Most notably, a material weakness in internal accounting controls and a major regulatory sanction from the Chinese government are significant red flags against quality and integrity. Furthermore, inconsistent sales performance, recent executive turnover, and a declining margin outlook suggest the company is not currently "outstanding" versus its competition. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the resolution of the "unreliable entity" listing in China and the successful remediation of its material weakness in internal controls. Flipping the "No" on accounting controls to "Yes" would require a clean audit opinion on internal controls in the next 10-K. A positive resolution in China, such as being removed from the list without significant penalty, would be needed to reconsider the "Integrity" point.

**fisher score is 6 / 15**
