**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

The company is also expanding into new, large addressable markets like food delivery, which is contributing to a quarterly active customer base growth of over 40% year-over-year. This indicates substantial market potential remains within China's vast e-commerce and related services sectors.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com's R&D is heavily focused on tangible, operational improvements, particularly in logistics and supply chain automation. As of June 2025, JD Logistics holds over 5,000 patents, with more than 3,000 related to automation and unmanned technology, including autonomous delivery vehicles. This investment translates to efficiency, which is a core part of JD's value proposition. While its R&D as a percentage of gross margin has historically been lower than competitors like Alibaba, the output in terms of proprietary logistics technology and infrastructure is a key competitive advantage.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com's ability to grow its quarterly active customer base by over 40% year-on-year in Q2 2025 demonstrates highly effective customer acquisition and retention. This growth significantly outpaced the broader market. User shopping frequency also rose by over 40% in the same period, indicating strong engagement. The company's success during major sales events like the "618 Grand Promotion" further highlights its marketing and sales execution capabilities.

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com's core retail business has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. The JD Retail segment's operating margin reached 4.5% in Q2 2025, a historical high for a promotional quarter and up from 3.9% in Q2 2024. The company has achieved 13 consecutive quarters of year-on-year gross margin expansion. However, at the consolidated level, the non-GAAP operating margin was only 0.3% in Q2 2025, down significantly from 4.0% a year prior, due to heavy investments in new businesses like food delivery. Because the profitable core is being weighed down by strategic investments, the consolidated margin is not currently worthwhile.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has explicitly stated a focus on improving operating efficiency. The core JD Retail business saw its operating margin expand to 4.5% in Q2 2025 from 3.9% the prior year, driven by supply chain optimizations. The company has achieved 13 straight quarters of gross margin expansion, highlighting a consistent ability to improve profitability in its core operations. CEO Sandy Xu stated the company will continue to focus on delivering the best user experience while lowering costs and improving efficiency.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com publicly emphasizes its commitment to employees, highlighting that JD Logistics provides full insurance and housing funds for frontline staff, with over 80% of these employees coming from rural areas. The company has job descriptions for roles like "Manager of Benefits and Employee Relations" which suggest formal structures are in place to address employee needs and conflict resolution. However, verifiable, recent, and independent data on employee satisfaction, attrition rates, or labor disputes is not readily available. The provided evidence consists primarily of company statements.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant management changes. In May 2023, Sandy Ran Xu was appointed CEO, succeeding Lei Xu who retired for personal reasons after a relatively short tenure. Founder Richard Liu stepped down as CEO in April 2022 but remains Chairman. While a new CEO and CFO were appointed in 2023, indicating a transition, the founder maintains a guiding role. This level of change at the highest executive ranks suggests a period of realignment rather than long-term stability.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a publicly listed management team with leaders for key functions like Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Compliance Officer. The recent elevation of the former JD Logistics CFO to group CFO suggests a degree of internal succession planning. However, the departure of the previous CEO in 2023 and the continued significant influence of the founder, Richard Liu, raise questions about the autonomy and depth of the broader management bench.
**Answer:** No

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com filed its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on April 17, 2025. This filing contains audited consolidated financial statements, indicating compliance with standard accounting and disclosure requirements. While the specific auditor's opinion on internal controls from this report was not found in the search, the timely filing of a 20-F with a major accounting firm implies that standard controls are in place and have been audited.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** JD.com's primary competitive advantage is its proprietary, in-house logistics and supply chain infrastructure. Unlike competitors who often rely on third-party logistics, JD's control over its network ensures delivery speed, reliability, and efficiency, which is a key differentiator in the Chinese e-commerce market. The company's significant and continued investment in supply chain technology, including thousands of patents in automation, further solidifies this structural advantage.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary and actions clearly prioritize long-term growth over short-term profits. The Q2 2025 earnings report shows that consolidated net income and operating margins fell sharply, which was explicitly attributed to "strategic investment in new businesses including our food delivery business." This willingness to absorb near-term margin headwinds to build out new, potentially large business lines is a classic indicator of a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong balance sheet and is actively returning capital to shareholders, indicating it is not in need of equity financing. As of June 30, 2025, JD.com held RMB 213.8 billion (approx. US$29.6 billion) in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Furthermore, the company has an active US$5.0 billion share repurchase program, under which it bought back US$1.5 billion in stock in the first half of 2025. This strong cash position and commitment to buybacks suggest a very low risk of dilutive equity financing.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q2 2025 earnings release and call, management was transparent about the negative impact of its strategic investments on current profitability. They explicitly stated that the decline in net income was a result of investments in new businesses like food delivery. They broke out the strong performance of the core JD Retail segment versus the losses in the new businesses, providing investors with a clear view of the underlying dynamics. This willingness to discuss challenges openly is a positive sign of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Founder and Chairman Richard Liu was the subject of a widely publicized rape allegation in 2018. While criminal charges were never filed by prosecutors due to "profound evidentiary problems," a civil lawsuit followed. This lawsuit was settled out of court in October 2022 just before the trial was set to begin. While the settlement is not an admission of guilt, the serious nature of the allegation and the subsequent civil suit prevent an assessment of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis**
JD.com scores well on factors within its direct operational control, such as its long-term growth strategy, R&D in logistics, sales execution, and financial strength. Its world-class supply chain remains a powerful competitive moat. The company's clear willingness to sacrifice near-term profits for long-term growth by investing in new ventures like food delivery is a key plank of the Fisher methodology. However, the analysis reveals weaknesses in "softer" factors, including management stability following a recent CEO change and questions surrounding the founder's past legal issues. The score could most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the performance of the new businesses and management stability. A successful scaling of the food delivery business that begins to show a clear path to profitability would flip the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" (Point 5) to a "Yes." Additionally, a period of stable execution under the current CEO without further high-level turnover would be required to change the answers on "Executive Relations" (Point 8) and "Depth of Management" (Point 9) to "Yes."

fisher score is 10 / 15
