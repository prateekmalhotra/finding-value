Company: Miami International Holdings, Inc. (MIAX), August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form S-1 Registration Statement (July 18, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX has demonstrated strong organic growth, with average daily volume in U.S. options increasing at a 23.5% CAGR from 2015 to 2024. The company is expanding its product suite and geographic reach through strategic acquisitions (e.g., The International Stock Exchange and the Bermuda Stock Exchange) and new product development, such as the exclusive ten-year license to list futures and options based on Bloomberg's B500 and B100Q indexes. These initiatives, along with the growth in the overall U.S. options market, provide a long runway for sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy is heavily focused on new product development and market expansion. The S-1 filing explicitly states plans to launch new futures and options products on the MIAX Futures Onyx trading platform in the second half of 2025, and cash-settled crypto-related products on its futures exchanges. The recent acquisitions of MIAX Futures, MIAXdx, the Bermuda Stock Exchange, and The International Stock Exchange demonstrate a commitment to expanding into new asset classes and geographies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX's proprietary, in-house built technology platform is a key competitive advantage, enabling high throughput, low latency, and reliability. The company has successfully leveraged this technology to launch four options exchanges, an equities exchange, and is in the process of migrating its futures exchange to a new proprietary platform. The S-1 does not break out R&D spending as a percentage of revenue, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the successful and rapid expansion of their exchange offerings serves as evidence of effective R&D.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX has successfully grown its market share in the competitive U.S. options market to 16.4% in the first half of 2025. A key part of its strategy has been the use of Equity Rights Programs (ERPs), which have effectively aligned the interests of large order flow providers and market makers with the exchange, driving volume growth. While not a traditional "sales" organization, this innovative approach to customer acquisition and retention has proven to be highly effective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the three months ended March 31, 2025, MIAX reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.4%. For the full year 2024, the adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.6%. The S-1 filing does not provide a direct comparison to peers. However, the ability to generate these margins in a highly competitive, transaction-based business suggests a worthwhile profit margin.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX is focused on increasing its market share in its core options business and expanding into higher-margin proprietary products. The company also states that its proprietary technology provides a scalable infrastructure, allowing for expansion into new asset classes while leveraging its existing cost structure. The monetization of market data is also identified as a growth opportunity that could improve margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The S-1 filing does not provide specific details on labor and personnel relations, such as employee turnover or engagement scores. The "Risk Factors" section mentions dependence on highly skilled employees and the intense competition for talent in the industry but does not indicate any existing labor issues. Without further information, it is not possible to determine if relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The S-1 filing indicates that the core team members have extensive experience and many have been with the company since its inception, suggesting a stable and cohesive team. The board of directors includes members with significant industry experience. However, there is no specific information in the S-1 about succession planning or the internal dynamics of the executive team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The S-1 provides biographies for the key executive officers and directors, who have extensive experience in the financial markets. The document also describes a broader team with expertise in trading, technology, and exchange operations. While the top executives are clearly very experienced, there is not enough information to assess the depth of management beyond the named executive officers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a newly public company, MIAX will now be subject to Sarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance, which requires management to report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting. The S-1 filing contains audited financial statements, and the company's independent registered public accounting firm has not identified any material weaknesses in internal controls. However, as an emerging growth company, MIAX is exempt from the auditor attestation requirement on internal controls for a period of time.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX's key differentiator is its proprietary, in-house built technology, which it claims provides superior speed, performance, and reliability compared to competitors. The company's innovative use of Equity Rights Programs (ERPs) to build market share by aligning its interests with those of its customers is another unique competitive advantage in the exchange industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MIAX's strategy of investing in new technology, acquiring other exchanges, and developing new proprietary products demonstrates a long-range outlook. The company is making significant investments to transform MIAX Futures from an agricultural-focused market to a full-solution DCM and DCO, and to expand its international presence. These are long-term initiatives that may not generate significant profits in the short term but are aimed at building a larger, more diversified business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has just completed its IPO, raising significant capital. The S-1 indicates the proceeds will be used to repay debt and for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions. While the company has a history of using equity (warrants in its ERPs) to incentivize customers, the recent IPO should provide sufficient capital for its near-term growth plans without the need for additional dilutive financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As MIAX has only just become a public company, there is no track record of public communications during times of trouble. The S-1 filing contains an extensive "Risk Factors" section that outlines the challenges and risks facing the business, which is standard practice. It is too early to assess how management will communicate with investors during difficult periods.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The S-1 filing does not disclose any material legal or regulatory actions against the company or its executives that would question their integrity. The company operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to oversight from the SEC and CFTC. However, without a longer public track record, it is difficult to definitively assess the integrity of management.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1438472/000119312525188887/d1438472ds1.htm) (July 18, 2025)

Synthesis:
MIAX scores well on the points related to its products, growth potential, and underlying business strategy. The company has a strong technological foundation, a proven ability to gain market share in a competitive environment, and a clear strategy for future growth through product and geographic expansion. The recent IPO provides the capital to execute on this strategy. The primary areas of uncertainty, leading to "No" scores, are related to the qualitative aspects of management and investor relations, which are difficult to assess for a newly public company. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the execution of its new product launches, particularly the Bloomberg-indexed products, and the successful integration of its recent acquisitions. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" on points like "Candor with Investors" and "Executive Relations" as the company establishes a public track record through quarterly earnings calls and shareholder communications.

fisher score is 10 / 15
