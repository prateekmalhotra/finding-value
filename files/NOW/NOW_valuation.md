Of course. Here is a critical review and corrected version of the valuation for ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW).

### **Critique of the Original Valuation**

The provided valuation is well-structured and detailed, but it contains a significant methodological flaw and several overly conservative assumptions that lead to an unrealistically low intrinsic value.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1.  **Flawed Free Cash Flow (FCFF) Calculation:** The primary issue is the formula used for FCFF: `FCFF = EBIAT + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in WC`. By subtracting the full, non-cash Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) expense, the calculation severely penalizes the resulting free cash flow. While SBC is a real economic cost to shareholders via dilution, the standard practice is to account for this cost by increasing the share count in the final per-share value calculation, not by subtracting it as a cash outflow (which it isn't). This flawed formula is the main reason the explicit period FCFF figures ($119M - $298M) are negligible for a company of ServiceNow's scale.
2.  **Unrealistic Share Count Projection:** The model assumes a *net 0.5% annual reduction* in shares. This is highly unlikely given that SBC is projected to be 17% of revenue—a massive number. The cash used for buybacks would need to be astronomically high to overcome the dilution from such a large SBC program. A more realistic assumption is a net *increase* in the share count.
3.  **Overly Conservative Margin Assumption:** Assuming a stable 20.0% EBIT margin for five years ignores the significant operating leverage inherent in a scaled SaaS business model. As ServiceNow grows, it is more realistic to expect some margin expansion as revenue growth outpaces the growth in operating expenses.
4.  **Terminal Value Disconnect:** The analyst correctly noted that the Gordon Growth method produced an absurdly low terminal value (due to the flawed FCFF), forcing a switch to an exit multiple. While the switch was the right move, the entire model is compromised because the near-zero cash flows in the explicit period make the valuation almost entirely dependent on the terminal value, diminishing the value of the five-year forecast.

### **Corrected and Revised Valuation of ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW)**

Here is a revised valuation that corrects the identified flaws and uses more realistic, balanced assumptions. The format and existing correct data have been preserved.

### **PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)**

*(This section is methodologically sound and remains unchanged. It effectively establishes the high expectations embedded in the current stock price.)*

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $735.50 (StockAnalysis.com, August 23, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (LTM as of June 30, 2025):** The following figures represent the trailing twelve months ending June 30, 2025, calculated from the company's SEC filings. All figures are in millions of USD.

| Metric | Value (Millions USD) | Source & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $10,955 | Sum of Q3'24, Q4'24, Q1'25, Q2'25 SEC Filings |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $2,191 | LTM GAAP Operating Income |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $730 | Sum of Q3'24, Q4'24, Q1'25, Q2'25 Cash Flow Statements |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $1,850 | Sum of Q3'24, Q4'24, Q1'25, Q2'25 Cash Flow Statements |
| Capital Expenditures | ($380) | Sum of Q3'24, Q4'24, Q1'25, Q2'25 Cash Flow Statements |
| **Cash & Equivalents** | **$5,500** | Q2 2025 10-Q, June 30, 2025 |
| **Total Debt** | **$1,490** | Q2 2025 10-Q, June 30, 2025 |
| **Diluted Shares** | **206** | Q2 2025 10-Q, June 30, 2025 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

*   **Market Capitalization:** $735.50/share * 206M shares = $151,513M
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $151,513M (Market Cap) + $1,490M (Debt) - $5,500M (Cash) = **$147,503M**
*   **WACC:** 9.9% (as calculated in Part 2)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

**Conclusion:** To justify the current market price of $735.50, one must believe ServiceNow can grow its revenues at a **compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 21.5% over the next five years**, assuming a stable 20% EBIT margin, a 9.9% WACC, and a 2.5% terminal growth rate.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** This revised valuation corrects the flawed FCFF calculation and incorporates more realistic assumptions about operating leverage and shareholder dilution. The goal is a balanced base case—not overly optimistic, but reflective of a market-leading enterprise software company's trajectory.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:** The tapering growth rate remains a sound approach.
    *   **Year 1:** 22.0%
    *   **Year 2:** 21.0%
    *   **Year 3:** 19.0%
    *   **Year 4:** 17.0%
    *   **Year 5:** 15.0%

8.  **Margin Path:** Assume modest operating leverage. The EBIT margin will expand by 50 bps per year from the current 20.0%, reflecting scale efficiencies that are common in mature SaaS companies.
    *   **EBIT Margin:** Starts at 20.5% in Year 1 and expands to **22.5% by Year 5**.

9.  **Taxes:** A **22% effective tax rate** remains a reasonable assumption based on historicals.

10. **Capital Intensity:** Historical averages remain appropriate.
    *   **Capex:** **3.5% of annual revenue**.
    *   **Working Capital:** **5.0% of the *change* in revenue**.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Model SBC as a declining percentage of revenue as the company matures and relies less on equity compensation. Taper from **17.0% of revenue in Year 1 down to 15.0% in Year 5**.
    *   **Share Count:** The cost of SBC will be reflected via dilution. Given the magnitude of SBC, it is more realistic to assume buybacks will only partially offset this dilution. Assume a **net 1.0% annual increase in shares outstanding**.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **Corrected FCFF Calculation:** The standard and correct formula for FCFF is used. SBC is a non-cash expense and is not subtracted. Its impact is captured in the share count.
    *   `FCFF = NOPAT + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital`
    *   Where `NOPAT = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate)`

13. **Rationale for Corrected FCFF:** This formula accurately measures the cash generated by the core business operations for all capital providers. The economic cost of SBC is properly accounted for by modeling an increase in the number of shares outstanding.

**Revised FCFF Forecast (in Millions USD):**

| Year | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $13,365 | $16,172 | $19,245 | $22,516 | $25,893 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *22.0%* | *21.0%* | *19.0%* | *17.0%* | *15.0%* |
| EBIT Margin | 20.5% | 21.0% | 21.5% | 22.0% | 22.5% |
| **EBIT** | **$2,739** | **$3,396** | **$4,138** | **$4,954** | **$5,826** |
| Tax (22%) | ($603) | ($747) | ($910) | ($1,090) | ($1,282) |
| **NOPAT** | **$2,137** | **$2,649** | **$3,227** | **$3,864** | **$4,544** |
| \+ D&A (6.7% of Rev) | $895 | $1,084 | $1,289 | $1,509 | $1,735 |
| \- Capex (3.5% of Rev) | ($468) | ($566) | ($674) | ($788) | ($906) |
| \- Chg in WC (5% of ΔRev) | ($121) | ($140) | ($154) | ($164) | ($169) |
| **FCFF** | **$2,443** | **$3,026** | **$3,689** | **$4,421** | **$5,204** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

*(The original WACC calculation is sound and remains unchanged.)*

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** 4.25% (RFR) + 1.15 (Beta) * 5.0% (ERP) = **10.0%**.
15. **Cost of Debt (After-Tax):** **5.5%**.
16. **WACC:** ($151,513/$153,003 * 10.0%) + ($1,490/$153,003 * 5.5%) = **9.9%**.

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Method Selection:** For a company like ServiceNow, which will still be growing at 15% in Year 5, an Exit Multiple approach is more realistic than a perpetuity growth formula (Gordon Growth), as it better reflects market pricing for mature but still-growing software businesses. The Gordon Growth model is better suited for companies in a true steady-state (2-4% growth).

18. **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT ($5,826M) + D&A ($1,735M) = **$7,561M**.
    *   **Exit Multiple:** A **20.0x EV/EBITDA multiple** remains a reasonable, balanced assumption. It's below the company's historical average, reflecting a transition to a more mature growth phase, but it appropriately values a market-leading SaaS business with high recurring revenue.
    *   **Terminal Value = $7,561M * 20.0 = $151,220M**.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value (EV):** `EV = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value`
    *   PV of FCFF (Years 1-5) = $2,443/(1.099)^1 + ... + $5,204/(1.099)^5 = **$14,332M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $151,220M / (1.099)^5 = **$94,360M**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $14,332M + $94,360M = $108,692M**

20. **Equity Value:** `Equity Value = EV - Net Debt`
    *   Net Debt = $1,490M (Total Debt) - $5,500M (Cash) = -$4,010M
    *   **Equity Value = $108,692M - (-$4,010M) = $112,702M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Projected Shares (Year 5):** 206M * (1 + 0.01)^5 = 216.5M shares.
    *   **Fair Value per Share = $112,702M / 216.5M = $520.56**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $520.56.** (As calculated above).
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $415.** (Assumes slower revenue growth tapering to 12%, EBIT margin expansion halts at 21%, and a 17x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $650.** (Assumes stronger revenue growth tapering to 18%, EBIT margins expand to 24%, and a 22x exit multiple).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:** A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a buffer against forecasting errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $520.56 * (1 - 0.30) = $364.39**

### **Risk Notes**

*(The original risks remain relevant.)*
The key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Competition:** Increased competition from larger software players (e.g., Salesforce, Oracle) could pressure growth rates and pricing power. 2) **Execution Risk:** Failure to effectively integrate new products and acquisitions could slow innovation and growth. 3) **Valuation Sensitivity:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the terminal exit multiple; a contraction in market multiples for software companies would significantly lower the intrinsic value. 4) **SBC Levels:** High stock-based compensation creates ongoing shareholder dilution. If buybacks are not sufficient to manage this, the impact on per-share value will be greater than modeled.

final answer is 520.56 $
