### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's management has a clear focus on long-term growth, as evidenced by their significant investments in Reality Labs and AI.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue is among the highest in the tech industry. While the ultimate success of their long-term bets on the metaverse remains to be seen, their investments in AI have already yielded significant improvements to their core advertising business through better recommendation algorithms. The company's large user base allows them to quickly test and deploy new features, giving them a significant advantage in R&D.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's self-serve advertising platform allows them to reach a massive number of customers with minimal sales friction. This has enabled them to build a highly profitable business with a relatively small direct sales force compared to other companies of their size. The company's ability to consistently grow its advertising revenue, even in a competitive market, speaks to the effectiveness of its sales and marketing efforts.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta has historically enjoyed very high profit margins, thanks to the high-margin nature of its advertising business. In the first quarter of 2025, the company's operating margin was 35%. While this is down from its peak, it is still well above the average for the S&P 500.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?

**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta has faced criticism in recent years for its intense work culture and the impact of its products on society. The company has also gone through multiple rounds of layoffs, which has likely impacted employee morale. While the company offers competitive compensation and benefits, the evidence does not suggest that its labor relations are outstanding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** No specific citations for this point.

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's executive team has been relatively stable, with Mark Zuckerberg as the founder and CEO since its inception. However, there have been some high-profile departures in recent years, including COO Sheryl Sandberg. The company's dual-class share structure gives Zuckerberg a significant amount of control, which could be a concern for some investors.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, publicly traded company, Meta is subject to stringent accounting standards and has its financial statements audited by a major accounting firm. The company provides detailed segment reporting for its Family of Apps and Reality Labs divisions, which gives investors good visibility into the performance of its different businesses.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's primary competitive advantage is its network effect. With billions of users across its family of apps, the company's platforms are essential for many people to stay connected with friends and family. This creates a powerful moat that is difficult for competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's management has a clear long-term focus, as evidenced by their willingness to invest billions of dollars in the metaverse, a project that is not expected to be profitable for many years. This has drawn criticism from some investors who are concerned about the impact on near-term profitability, but it is a clear indication of the company's long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta has a very strong balance sheet with a large cash position and no long-term debt. The company generates significant free cash flow, which is more than enough to fund its growth initiatives and share buybacks.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta's management is generally transparent with investors, providing detailed financial reporting and holding regular earnings calls. However, the company has been criticized in the past for its handling of controversies related to user data and content moderation.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** No specific citations for this point.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Meta has been at the center of numerous controversies over the years, including the Cambridge Analytica scandal and concerns about the impact of its platforms on mental health and political discourse. While the company has taken steps to address these issues, the repeated nature of these problems raises questions about the integrity of its management.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** No specific citations for this point.

---
**Synthesis:**
Meta Platforms scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its strong market position, profitability, and long-term growth potential. The company's massive user base and network effects give it a durable competitive advantage, while its investments in AI and the metaverse could drive growth for many years to come. However, the company faces significant challenges related to its labor relations, executive stability, and public perception. The biggest variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its Reality Labs division and its ability to navigate the evolving regulatory landscape. A significant improvement in employee morale and a reduction in the number of public controversies would be needed to flip the "No" answers to "Yes".
