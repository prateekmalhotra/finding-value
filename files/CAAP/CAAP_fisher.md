**Company:** Corporación América Airports S.A. (CAAP)
**Date of Analysis:** August 20, 2025
**Primary Sources Reviewed:** 2024 Form 20-F, Q2 2025 Earnings Release.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Corporación América Airports operates 52 airports in 6 countries, a business with a long runway tied to global and regional economic growth, tourism, and trade. In 2024, the company served 79.0 million passengers, still 6.2% below pre-pandemic levels, indicating a continued recovery potential. Passenger traffic grew by 13.7% in Q2 2025, reaching 20.7 million, with strong performance in key markets like Argentina, Brazil, and Italy, suggesting a sustained growth trajectory. The company is also focused on growing its commercial revenues, which increased by 22% in the second quarter of 2025, reducing its dependency on aeronautical fees and tapping into the growth of travel retail and other passenger services.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a commitment to ongoing development through strategic acquisitions and expansion of its service offerings. For instance, CAAP increased its stake in Toscana Aeroporti in May 2025, signaling a commitment to growth in its European operations. Furthermore, the nearly 19% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 2025 was not only driven by a rebound in passenger traffic but also by a significant 22% increase in commercial revenue, indicating a focus on developing higher-margin, non-aeronautical services. This strategy of expanding both its airport network and the commercial offerings within its existing airports points to a determination to increase sales potential beyond simple passenger growth.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Corporación América Airports, as an operator of airport concessions, does not have traditional R&D expenses in the same way a technology or pharmaceutical company would. Its development efforts are more focused on process improvements, operational efficiency, and the adoption of new technologies. The company's 2024 annual report mentions a focus on sustainability and compliance with new reporting standards, which involves process development. However, there are no specific metrics disclosed to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts in relation to the company's size.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s “sales” are driven by attracting airlines to its airports and increasing passenger traffic, as well as by growing its commercial revenues from retail, food and beverage, and other services. The 13.7% year-over-year growth in passenger traffic in Q2 2025, reaching a record level in Argentina, suggests success in attracting airlines and passengers. The 22% growth in commercial revenue in the same period further indicates an effective "sales" effort in its non-aeronautical segment. However, without specific data on airline route development, passenger incentives, or commercial space occupancy and leasing rates, it's difficult to definitively assess the sales organization as "above-average."

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Corporación América Airports demonstrated strong profitability in its most recent reporting period. In the second quarter of 2025, the company's adjusted EBITDA margin ex-IFRIC12 was 38.6%, an expansion of 140 basis points. The operating margin was 24.6%. For the full year 2024, the company reported a net income from continuing operations of $307.9 million on revenues of $1,843.3 million, resulting in a net margin of approximately 16.7%. These are healthy margins for an airport operator.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively working to improve its profit margins through cost controls and a focus on higher-margin revenue streams. In Q2 2025, adjusted EBITDA climbed 25.5% to $171.2 million, a result of what analysts described as "tighter cost management". The company is also strategically growing its commercial revenue, which is typically higher-margin than its aeronautical revenue. This is evidenced by the 22% increase in commercial revenue in the second quarter of 2025. This focus on cost discipline and a more profitable revenue mix contributed to a 140 basis point expansion in the adjusted EBITDA margin to 38.6%.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information available in the provided search results regarding the company's labor and personnel relations, such as employee turnover, union relations, or employee satisfaction surveys. While the company's operational performance has been strong, this does not provide direct evidence of outstanding labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The search results do not contain information about the company's executive relations, such as the tenure of the management team, board stability, or any internal conflicts. Therefore, it is not possible to assess the quality of executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The search results do not provide a detailed list of the company's management team beyond the CEO and the Investor Relations contact. While the company operates a large and complex business across multiple countries, which would suggest a significant management structure, there is no specific evidence of management depth or succession planning in the provided information.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial reporting is prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and is subject to audit. The company also deals with the complexity of hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina (IAS 29), which it reports on separately to provide a clearer picture of its underlying performance. This suggests a sophisticated level of accounting control. The ability to manage costs effectively, as evidenced by the margin expansion in Q2 2025, also points to strong cost analysis capabilities. The company's filings with the SEC are up to date, with the 2024 20-F filed on March 27, 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a private airport operator, Corporación América Airports' key competitive advantages lie in the long-term nature of its concession agreements and its geographic diversification. Operating 52 airports in 6 countries gives the company a unique platform and reduces its reliance on any single market. The company's ability to operate in complex regulatory environments, such as Argentina with its hyperinflationary economy, and still deliver strong growth and profitability, is a key indicator of its operational expertise. The record passenger traffic in Argentina in Q2 2025, a market where the company manages 37 of the 56 airports in the national system, demonstrates its strong position in that market.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy of expanding its airport network through acquisitions, such as the increased stake in Toscana Aeroporti, and investing in the growth of its higher-margin commercial revenues, points to a long-range outlook on profits. These investments may not always maximize short-term earnings but are designed to build a more profitable and resilient business in the long run. The company's focus on becoming less dependent on passenger numbers by growing its non-aeronautical services also supports this view.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company appears to have a strong financial position. As of the end of Q2 2025, Corporación América Airports had a strong liquidity position of $497 million and a low net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.0x. For the full year 2024, cash and cash equivalents totaled $439.8 million and the net debt to LTM Adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.1x, an improvement from 1.4x at the end of 2023. This strong balance sheet and low leverage suggest that the company is well-positioned to fund its growth initiatives without needing to resort to dilutive equity financing.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed financial results, including the impact of hyperinflationary accounting in Argentina, which demonstrates a commitment to transparency. They also hold regular conference calls with investors to discuss their results. However, the available information does not provide specific examples of management's communication during a period of significant trouble, making it difficult to fully assess their candor in such situations.
**Answer:** No

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The search results do not contain any information that would bring the integrity of the company's management into question, such as legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags. However, the absence of negative information is not sufficient to definitively answer "Yes" to this question without more direct evidence of the management's track record and reputation.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**Synthesis:**
Corporación América Airports S.A. scores positively on several of Fisher's key points, particularly those related to its business model, financial strength, and growth prospects. The company's geographically diversified portfolio of airports provides a long runway for growth, and management is actively pursuing both aeronautical and non-aeronautical revenue streams to improve margins. The strong balance sheet and low leverage mitigate the risk of equity dilution. However, the analysis is hampered by a lack of information regarding the management team's depth, executive and labor relations, and a track record of communication during challenging periods. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months by a sustained recovery in passenger traffic to above pre-pandemic levels, continued margin expansion driven by the growth of the commercial segment, and greater transparency from the company regarding its management team and their performance during periods of adversity. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" on "Above-Average Sales Organization" with more detailed disclosure on airline route development and commercial leasing success. Similarly, more insight into management's handling of a significant operational or financial challenge would be needed to change the answer on "Candor with Investors."

**fisher score is 8 / 15**
