*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's belief that the stock is undervalued.

*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Repurchase of $2 million worth of shares.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Repurchase of $4 million worth of shares.
    *   **High Scenario:** Repurchase of the full $8.1 million.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 2-5%. This is a conservative estimate based on the size of the repurchase program relative to the company's market capitalization.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The company has a history of share repurchase programs, and the current authorization is in place.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (short)**

**1. Sustained Same-Store Sales Growth**

*   **Formula:** Price Target = Current P/E \* (Current EPS \* (1 + EPS Growth Rate))
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current P/E: 15x (representative for the industry)
    *   Current EPS: $1.50 (annualized from the most recent quarter)
    *   Base EPS Growth (from same-store sales): 6%
    *   High EPS Growth (from same-store sales): 9%
*   **Calculation:**
    *   **Base Case:** 15 \* (1.50 \* 1.06) = $23.85
    *   **High Case:** 15 \* (1.50 \* 1.09) = $24.53

**2. Share Repurchase Program**

*   **Formula:** Price Target = (Market Cap / (Current Shares - Repurchased Shares)) \* P/E
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Market Cap: $500 million
    *   Current Shares: 22.9 million
    *   Repurchase Amount: $8.1 million
    *   Average Repurchase Price: $22
    *   Repurchased Shares: 368,181
*   **Calculation:**
    *   New Share Count: 22,900,000 - 368,181 = 22,531,819
    *   New Price per Share (pre-P/E adjustment): $500,000,000 / 22,531,819 = $22.19
