Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed: Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc., August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed include the company's 2024 10-K filing (for the year ended December 31, 2024).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The demand for behavioral healthcare services in the U.S. is substantial and growing, with over one in five adults experiencing mental illness. Acadia's growth strategy directly addresses this unmet need through a five-pathway approach: expanding existing facilities, forming joint venture partnerships, building new *de novo* facilities, making acquisitions, and broadening its continuum of care. The company is actively executing this strategy, having added 776 beds in 2024 and completed construction on approximately 1,300 new beds.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acadia's management has a clearly defined and consistently communicated growth strategy focused on capacity expansion. For 2024, capital expenditures were $690 million, a 78.7% increase from 2023, funding the addition of 776 beds through new facilities, joint ventures, and expansions of existing locations. The company projects another $630 million to $690 million in capital expenditures for 2025, demonstrating a sustained commitment to growth. Management has also established a long-term goal of adding 800-1,000 new beds annually.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025),

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a healthcare services provider, Acadia does not have traditional R&D expenses comparable to pharmaceutical or technology companies. Its "R&D" equivalent is the development of new service lines, facility designs, and treatment programs. The company's primary focus is on expanding its existing service offerings into new and existing markets, rather than developing entirely new treatment modalities. The effectiveness of this development is measured by the successful opening of new facilities and the expansion of bed capacity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acadia's "sales" are driven by patient referrals from a variety of sources, including healthcare practitioners, public programs, and managed care organizations. The company's growth in patient days, which increased 3.2% on a same-facility basis in 2024, indicates a strong and effective referral network. Acadia's strategy of forming joint ventures with leading health systems, such as Intermountain Health, serves as a key component of its sales and marketing efforts by creating built-in referral channels.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the year ended December 31, 2024, Acadia's net income margin was 8.4%. While this is a decrease from 2022's 10.7%, it is an improvement over 2023's net loss. The company's adjusted EBITDA margin guidance for 2025 is between $675 million and $725 million on revenues of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion, which implies a margin of approximately 20-21%. These margins are substantial for a healthcare facilities operator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acadia is focused on several initiatives to improve margins, including a plan to enhance the performance of a "handful of underperforming facilities." The company is also making significant investments in technology to increase operational efficiency. Additionally, Acadia's expansion strategy, particularly its joint venture model, is designed to generate strong returns on investment and improve margins as new facilities mature.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K notes that, like most healthcare providers, its facilities have experienced rising labor costs and turnover, and in some markets, the availability and retention of qualified medical personnel have become significant operating issues. The company has had to use more expensive contract labor at certain facilities. Only one of its facilities has a labor union, representing approximately 131 employees. While the company offers a comprehensive benefits package, the noted challenges with turnover and labor costs suggest that labor relations are not "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is some evidence of recent instability in the executive ranks. The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) recently stepped down, which can create uncertainty. However, the company's 2024 10-K states that the executive management team has over 225 combined years of experience in the healthcare industry. The CEO, Chris Hunter, has articulated a clear long-term vision for the company. Without further evidence of widespread turnover or internal conflict, it is difficult to conclude that executive relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K highlights the extensive experience of its executive management team. The company also has a decentralized management structure, with leadership at the facility level, including a chief executive officer, medical director, and director of nursing at each inpatient facility. This structure provides a layer of operational management depth below the executive level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's external auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. The 10-K also includes a "Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting," which concluded that internal controls were effective. There is no evidence of recent restatements or material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acadia's joint venture strategy with prominent non-profit health systems is a key competitive differentiator. These partnerships provide a capital-efficient way to expand, create strong referral streams, and enhance the company's reputation and market position. The company has 21 joint venture partnerships for 22 hospitals, with 12 already operational and 10 more planned. This strategy allows Acadia to embed itself within local healthcare ecosystems, creating a competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Acadia's management is clearly focused on long-term growth, even at the expense of short-term results. The company significantly increased its capital expenditures in 2024 to accelerate bed expansion, which is expected to pay off in 2026 and beyond. Management has also guided that startup costs for new facilities will be elevated in the first half of 2025. This willingness to invest heavily in future capacity demonstrates a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Acadia had $76.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $129.7 million in cash from operating activities for the year. The company has a revolving credit facility with $226.5 million of availability. The board also authorized a $300 million share repurchase program in February 2025, suggesting confidence in the company's financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, not diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent communications from the company indicate a high degree of candor. In its Q4 2024 earnings report and subsequent call, management provided what they termed "conservative guidance" for 2025 and acknowledged that startup costs for new facilities would be elevated in the near term. They also openly discussed the challenges of a "handful of underperforming facilities." This transparency, particularly when delivering news that may not be well-received by the market, is a positive sign.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has been involved in significant legal proceedings. In 2023, Acadia paid $400 million to settle three lawsuits related to its Desert Hills facility in New Mexico. While the settlements included no admission of liability, the size of the payment and the nature of the allegations raise serious questions. The company's 10-K also discloses ongoing governmental investigations. This history of legal issues prevents a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1520697/000095017025029095/achc-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025).

**Synthesis:**
Acadia Healthcare scores well on Fisher's checklist in areas related to its market opportunity, growth strategy, and financial management. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the significant and growing demand for behavioral healthcare services through a clear and aggressive expansion plan. Its joint venture strategy is a particular strength, creating a competitive moat and a clear path to growth. However, the analysis reveals weaknesses in labor relations, recent executive instability, and, most significantly, a history of legal and regulatory issues that call into question the integrity of the company's operations. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful integration and ramp-up of its new facilities, which would improve margins and demonstrate the effectiveness of its capital deployment, and the resolution of any outstanding legal matters without further significant financial or reputational damage. A "No" on integrity would flip to a "Yes" with a sustained period of no new major legal or regulatory actions and a clear demonstration that the issues at the Desert Hills facility were isolated and have been remediated.

fisher score is 11 / 15
