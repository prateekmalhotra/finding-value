**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Trip.com Group's R&D is focused on application and integration rather than pure research. Product development expenses were RMB 3.7 billion in Q1 2025, representing a significant investment. The output is visible in platform enhancements like the integration of AI tools (TripGen) and new features for content generation. The company's ability to quickly deploy these technologies to its massive user base suggests an effective R&D function focused on commercial outcomes.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific, recent, and verifiable evidence available in the annual report or earnings transcripts regarding employee turnover, engagement scores, or labor disputes. The company's 20-F provides standard disclosures on its workforce but lacks the detail required to make a definitive judgment on the quality of its personnel relations. Without concrete positive evidence, the answer must be negative per the decision rule.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a broad leadership team with executives overseeing key business units such as accommodation, transportation, and corporate travel, as well as functional heads for technology and finance. The long tenure of many senior leaders suggests a deep bench of experience. However, detailed succession plans beyond the top executives are not publicly disclosed, introducing a potential risk factor.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the OTA industry, scale and network effects are paramount. Trip.com's massive user base in China and its growing global presence create a virtuous cycle: more users attract more suppliers (hotels, airlines), which in turn provides more choice and better prices for users. The ownership of Skyscanner, a leading global travel meta-search engine, provides a significant competitive advantage in customer acquisition and market intelligence.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary consistently balances current profitability with investments for future growth. Their significant and sustained spending on technology (AI) and international expansion, even as the business recovers, demonstrates a willingness to reinvest for the long term. In earnings calls, they emphasize capturing the vast opportunities in the global travel market over maximizing short-term margins.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong balance sheet and robust cash flow. As of March 31, 2025, Trip.com Group held cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments of RMB 83.3 billion. The company also engages in regular share buybacks under its authorized program, indicating confidence in its financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a consistent and transparent communication schedule with investors through quarterly earnings calls and participation in industry conferences.

**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's 20-F filing under "Legal Proceedings" does not reveal any material litigation or regulatory actions that would call the integrity of senior management into question.

There are no prominent red flags concerning related-party transactions or governance issues.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**
Trip.com Group scores highly on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its dominant market position, strong financial health, and clear strategy for future growth. The company's main strengths lie in its technological investments (particularly in AI), its powerful multi-brand portfolio that creates significant network effects, and a stable, long-tenured management team. The primary negative is a lack of specific disclosures on personnel relations, a common issue for many large corporations but a failure under Fisher's strict criteria. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two factors: the pace and success of its international expansion beyond Asia, and its ability to maintain margin strength amid intense competition and a shifting global macroeconomic environment. A "No" on labor relations could flip to "Yes" with the inclusion of specific metrics like employee turnover or satisfaction scores in future ESG or annual reports.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
