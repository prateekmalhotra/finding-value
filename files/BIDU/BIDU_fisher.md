### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu's growth is increasingly propelled by its AI Cloud and other non-online marketing ventures. In the second quarter of 2025, the AI Cloud segment's revenue saw a 27% year-over-year increase, reaching RMB 6.5 billion. The company is also a significant competitor in China's autonomous driving sector. While the core online marketing business has faced challenges, evidenced by a 15% year-over-year revenue decline in Q2 2025, the expansion in AI and cloud services indicates substantial long-term growth potential.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the second quarter of 2025, research and development expenses represented 18% of Baidu Core's revenue. The 27% growth of the AI cloud business suggests that these R&D investments are effectively translating into commercial success in high-priority areas.

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the second quarter of 2025, Baidu Core reported a net margin of 28% and a non-GAAP net margin of 18%. These figures indicate strong profitability within the company's core operations.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The strategic shift towards the high-growth AI cloud business is a key driver for potential margin improvement. While the earnings call noted increased costs associated with this segment, the overall profitability of the core business remains robust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The available search results do not offer information on Baidu's labor and personnel relations, including metrics such as employee attrition or engagement.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Q2 2025 earnings call featured a consistent executive team, led by Co-Founder and CEO Robin Li. However, a comprehensive assessment of executive relations is not possible without additional information on board stability and succession planning.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The participation of the CEO, the EVP of the Mobile Ecosystem Group, the EVP of the AI Cloud Group, and the CFO in the Q2 2025 earnings call indicates a well-structured leadership team. Nevertheless, the provided information is insufficient to gauge the management depth beyond these top-level executives.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a company that files a Form 20-F with the SEC, Baidu adheres to a certain standard of accounting controls. A thorough evaluation of its cost analysis and internal controls would necessitate a review of the full filing.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's consistent emphasis on long-term investments in AI, even as the core advertising business faces headwinds, points to a long-range strategic outlook. The company is evidently prioritizing future growth in AI and cloud services.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Baidu reported a strong financial position with RMB 124.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and short-term investments. This substantial cash reserve suggests the company is well-equipped to finance its growth initiatives without the need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q2 2025 earnings call, Baidu's management openly addressed both the 4% year-over-year decline in total revenues and the 15% drop in online marketing revenue, while also emphasizing the growth in its AI cloud business. This transparent approach to discussing both successes and challenges indicates a high degree of candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

### Synthesis

Baidu's evaluation against Fisher's 15 points reveals a company with a strong foundation and a clear vision for the future, albeit with some unanswered questions. The company's strengths lie in its commitment to the long-term growth of its AI and cloud businesses, which are demonstrating significant revenue growth and possess a substantial runway for expansion. Furthermore, Baidu maintains healthy profit margins in its core operations and boasts a robust balance sheet, mitigating the risk of shareholder dilution from future financing needs. The primary areas of uncertainty stem from a lack of available information regarding the company's sales organization, labor relations, management depth, and accounting controls. Over the next 12 to 24 months, Baidu's Fisher score will likely be influenced by the continued execution of its AI strategy and the performance of the online advertising market. A more favorable score could be achieved with positive disclosures in these areas of uncertainty.
