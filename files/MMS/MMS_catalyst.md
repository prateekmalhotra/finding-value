### **2) Top 3 Prioritized Catalysts (Summary Table)**

| Catalyst Title | Type | Timing Window | Impact (Small/Medium/Large + % Range) | Probability (0–100%) | One-Line Evidence Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Share Repurchase Program Execution**| Corporate Action | 0-12 months | Small (2-5%) | 85% | Board authorized a $400 million stock purchase program in June and December 2024. |
| **U.S. Federal Services Segment Growth**| Operational | 0-12 months | Medium (10-20%) | 75% | Revenue increased 12.5% in the nine months ended June 30, 2025, driven by clinical programs. |
| **Resolution of Contract Recompetes**| Operational | 6-18 months | Large (>30%) | 60% | Recompetes for Contact Center Operations and VA MDE contracts are in progress. |

### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The Board of Directors authorized a $400 million stock purchase program in June and December 2024. As of June 30, 2025, $65.8 million remained available for future stock purchases.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). Higher EPS, even with the same net income, can lead to a higher stock price, assuming the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio remains constant.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with the current authorization likely to be executed over the next 6-12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: An additional $30 million in repurchases at an average price of $70/share would retire ~428,000 shares.
    *   Base Case: An additional $65.8 million in repurchases at an average price of $70/share would retire ~940,000 shares.
    *   High Case: The company could increase the authorization and repurchase up to $100 million in the next 12 months, retiring ~1.43 million shares at $70/share.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). The repurchase program is relatively small compared to the company's market capitalization, but it provides a consistent tailwind for the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has a history of executing on its repurchase authorizations.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Sufficient free cash flow generation and management's discretion to execute repurchases.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in Form 10-Q filings, announcements of new or expanded repurchase authorizations.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in business performance could lead the company to preserve cash and pause repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases as an indicator of management's confidence in the business outlook.

**2. Catalyst Title:** U.S. Federal Services Segment Growth and Margin Expansion
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The U.S. Federal Services segment, which accounts for over half of the company's revenue, has been a strong performer. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, revenue increased 12.5% and operating margin expanded to 15.3% from 12.5% in the prior-year period.
*   **Mechanism:** Continued growth and margin expansion in the largest segment directly drive higher consolidated earnings. This can lead to upward revisions in analyst estimates and a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with results reported quarterly.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: Segment revenue grows 5% with a 13% operating margin.
    *   Base Case: Segment revenue grows 10% with a 15% operating margin.
    *   High Case: Segment revenue grows 15% with a 16% operating margin.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). Continued strong performance in this segment is a key driver of the company's overall financial results.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The segment has strong momentum, but is subject to risks from contract recompetes.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful execution on existing contracts, winning new contracts, and managing costs effectively.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly segment revenue and operating margin, backlog by segment, announcements of new federal contract awards.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Loss of a major contract, such as the Contact Center Operations or VA MDE contracts, would have a significant negative impact.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The U.S. Federal Services segment is currently the primary growth engine for the company.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Resolution of Major Contract Recompetes
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Two of the company's most significant contracts, the Contact Center Operations (CCO) contract with CMS and the VA Medical Disability Examinations (MDE) contracts, are currently in the recompete process. The CCO contract represents 10-15% of total annual revenue.
*   **Mechanism:** A successful recompete of these large contracts would remove a major overhang on the stock and secure a significant portion of the company's revenue base for the long term. This would likely lead to a re-rating of the stock to a higher P/E multiple.
*   **Timing:** 6-18 months. The timing of government contract awards can be unpredictable.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Case: Loss of both contracts, leading to a significant revenue and earnings decline.
    *   Base Case: Win one of the two major contracts, resulting in a partial offset to the lost revenue from the other.
    *   High Case: Win both contracts, securing a large portion of the revenue base and providing a platform for future growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). The outcome of these recompetes is the most significant catalyst for the stock over the long term.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. Maximus is the incumbent provider on both contracts, which provides an advantage, but competition is fierce.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Competitive pricing, strong past performance, and favorable government procurement decisions.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Announcements from the company or government agencies regarding the status of the CCO and VA MDE contract awards.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Losing one or both contracts to a competitor would be a major blow to the company's growth prospects.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The uncertainty around these recompetes is a major risk, but a positive resolution would be a significant catalyst.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. U.S. Federal Services Segment Growth**
*   **Formula:** (Segment Revenue \* Segment Operating Margin) / Shares Outstanding = EPS Contribution
*   **Base Case:** ($2.74B \* 15%) / 56.35M shares = $7.28 EPS contribution
*   **High Case:** ($2.9B \* 16%) / 56.35M shares = $8.23 EPS contribution
*   **Citation:** Revenue and margin data from the Q3 2025 10-Q; share count from the Q3 2025 10-Q.

**2. Share Repurchase Program**
*   **Formula:** Net Income / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased) = New EPS
*   **Base Case:** $243.7M / (56.35M - 0.94M) = $4.40 EPS
*   **Current EPS:** $243.7M / 56.35M = $4.33 EPS
*   **Citation:** Net income and share count from the Q3 2025 10-Q. Repurchase scenario from this report.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Maximus are moderately positive. The ongoing share repurchase program provides a steady, albeit small, tailwind for the stock. The strong performance of the U.S. Federal Services segment is a significant positive, but this is somewhat offset by the uncertainty surrounding the major contract recompetes. The market is likely to remain in a "wait and see" mode until there is more clarity on the outcome of the CCO and VA MDE contracts.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Loss of Major Contracts:** The loss of either the CCO or VA MDE contract would have a material adverse effect on revenue and profitability, likely leading to a significant stock price decline.
2.  **Cybersecurity Incident:** The company has been dealing with the fallout from the MOVEit cybersecurity incident, including class-action lawsuits. A significant adverse judgment or a new major cybersecurity breach could lead to substantial costs and reputational damage.
3.  **Government Spending Cuts:** As a government contractor, Maximus is vulnerable to changes in government spending priorities. Significant budget cuts to the programs Maximus supports could lead to contract terminations or scope reductions.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Maximus presents a mixed investment case with significant potential upside but also substantial risks. The primary positive catalyst is the strong growth and profitability of the U.S. Federal Services segment. However, this is overshadowed by the uncertainty surrounding the recompetes for the CCO and VA MDE contracts. The most important indicator to monitor is any news regarding the status of these contract awards. A successful outcome on both recompetes could lead to a significant re-rating of the stock, while a loss of either would be a major setback.
