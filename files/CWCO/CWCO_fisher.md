Company: Consolidated Water Co. Ltd. (CWCO)
Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K filed March 17, 2025 (for fiscal year ended December 31, 2024).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Consolidated Water operates in regions like the Caribbean and the southwestern U.S. that have limited natural freshwater supplies, creating a durable and growing demand for its core desalination and water treatment services. The company's strategy, per its 2024 10-K, is to expand in markets with "significant unfulfilled demands for desalinated potable water, water treatment and reuse systems". Evidence of this expansion includes securing a contract in June 2023 to design, build, and operate a new desalination plant in Oahu, Hawaii, demonstrating entry into new geographies. The growth of its U.S. services segment, PERC, further supports this, as it addresses increasing demand for water treatment and reuse infrastructure.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a commitment to growth through both organic projects and strategic acquisitions. The company is actively investing in new capacity, including commissioning a new, larger seawater desalination plant in West Bay, Grand Cayman, in late 2023 and expanding its Aerex manufacturing facility, with completion expected in June 2025. Furthermore, the company expanded its service offerings by acquiring Ramey Environmental Compliance, Inc. (REC) in October 2023 to broaden its water and wastewater treatment operations in the U.S. These actions show a clear intent to reinvest capital to grow and diversify revenue streams beyond existing assets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements do not report any specific research and development expenses. Its business description mentions that its subsidiary, DesalCo, "sometimes tests new components and technology offered by suppliers" and collaborates with them on product development. This indicates a focus on applying and integrating existing technologies rather than conducting fundamental R&D to create proprietary technology or patents. As a utility and services provider, its focus is on operational efficiency, not R&D-led product innovation.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the 10-K does not detail a formal sales force, the company's long history of winning and renewing long-term, exclusive, and semi-exclusive government contracts in the Caribbean demonstrates significant business development acumen. More recently, its expansion in the U.S. has resulted in major contract wins, such as the Liberty Utilities water treatment plant in Arizona and the new desalination plant project in Hawaii. This ability to secure large, complex projects in competitive markets indicates an effective sales and bidding process.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has sustained strong profit margins. According to its 2024 10-K, consolidated gross profit margin was 34.0% in fiscal 2024 and 34.4% in fiscal 2023. The retail segment is particularly profitable, with a gross margin of 55% in 2024. These margins indicate a strong competitive position, pricing power in its licensed and contracted markets, and efficient operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's long-term contracts in its retail and bulk segments typically include provisions for annual inflation adjustments, which help protect margins from rising costs. In the services segment, management improved gross margins from 20% in 2022 to 32% in 2023 through improved execution on large construction projects. For the manufacturing segment, gross margin increased from 23% in 2023 to 30% in 2024 due to a strategic focus on a "higher margin product mix." These actions demonstrate a multi-faceted approach to margin maintenance and improvement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states, "We have historically experienced low employee turnover." It also explicitly notes, "We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and none are represented by labor unions. We consider our relationship with our employees to be very good." As of March 10, 2025, the company employed 307 people. The absence of reported strikes, disputes, or unionization efforts provides positive evidence of stable labor relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The management team exhibits stability. The President and CEO, Frederick W. McTaggart, has a long tenure with the company, and the 2024 10-K notes he has an employment agreement through December 31, 2027, indicating continuity in leadership. The corporate structure, with distinct leadership for its various segments, appears stable and organized. There are no reports of significant executive turnover or internal disputes in the company's filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates four distinct business segments (Retail, Bulk, Services, Manufacturing), each requiring specialized operational management. For instance, the services and manufacturing segments are run through U.S. subsidiaries (PERC, Aerex) with their own leadership structures, demonstrating a decentralized and deep management team beyond the corporate executive level. The acquisition and integration of REC in 2023 further attests to the company's ability to manage a diverse and growing organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Marcum LLP, identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The weakness related to "insufficient information technology general controls designed to monitor direct changes to databases within two accounting systems" for a portion of 2024. While the auditor's opinion on the financial statements themselves was unqualified, a declared material weakness indicates a significant deficiency in accounting controls.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's key competitive advantage is its exclusive 20-year retail license from the Cayman Islands government, which creates a regulated monopoly in its most profitable service area. This, combined with other long-term bulk supply contracts with governments, provides a durable, predictable revenue base that is difficult for competitors to disrupt. Decades of operational experience with reverse osmosis technology in sensitive tourism-dependent environments also serves as a significant non-replicable asset.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently demonstrates a focus on long-term growth. The 2024 10-K outlines a strategy of market expansion and pursuing acquisitions that enhance long-term capabilities. The company is making significant long-term capital investments, such as building a multi-year, $147 million desalination plant in Hawaii and expanding its manufacturing facilities in Florida. These substantial reinvestments into the business prioritize the creation of long-term, durable revenue streams over maximizing near-term earnings per share.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a very strong, liquid balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, it held $99.4 million in cash and cash equivalents with a working capital of $132.8 million and minimal long-term debt. Cash flow from operations was robust at $36.5 million in fiscal 2024. This strong internal liquidity position, coupled with a consistent history of funding capital expenditures and acquisitions with cash on hand, indicates a very low risk of needing to issue dilutive equity to fund foreseeable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is candid about its primary business challenges in its SEC filings. The "Risk Factors" and "MD&A" sections of the 2024 10-K provide extensive, multi-page discussions on the two most significant risks: the ongoing, protracted negotiations for the Cayman retail license and the recurring delays in collecting receivables from its Bahamas government customer. The company holds regular quarterly earnings calls, providing a consistent forum for investor communication. This transparency on key difficulties suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025); https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CWCO/transcripts/ (August 20, 2025).

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K reports no material legal proceedings against it. A review of the company's filings does not reveal any related-party transactions that would suggest self-dealing, nor are there any reports of regulatory scandals or major code-of-conduct breaches. The identified material weakness in internal controls appears to be a process/systems issue rather than an ethical lapse, and the company has been transparent in disclosing it.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/928340/000155837025003137/cwco-20241231x10k.htm (March 17, 2025).

**Synthesis**

Consolidated Water scores well on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting the characteristics of a durable, well-managed business operating in a niche market with favorable long-term trends. Its strongest positives are its fortress-like balance sheet, high and stable profit margins driven by regulated or long-term contracted assets, and a clear strategy of reinvesting for growth in new markets like the U.S. However, the analysis reveals two significant negatives that temper the score: the lack of a formal R&D effort and, more critically, the recently disclosed material weakness in internal accounting controls. The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12–24 months are the outcomes of the Cayman retail license renegotiation and the collection of delayed Bahamian receivables. A favorable new license agreement would solidify its most profitable segment for years to come, while continued delays in receivables could strain finances and investor confidence. To flip the "No" on accounting controls to "Yes," the company must remediate the identified material weakness and have its auditor certify the effectiveness of its internal controls in its next annual report.
