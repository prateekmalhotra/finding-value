### C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **1.5% annually.** No explicit guidance was given. This conservative rate reflects a mature industry and is based on a blend of recent performance (4% revenue growth in Q2 2025) and the need for a realistic, non-speculative long-term rate. | (Boyd Gaming Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 24, 2025). |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin** | **23.8%.** Kept stable at the TTM level. Management did not provide specific margin targets, and in the absence of clear initiatives for expansion, assuming a stable margin grounded in recent performance is the most realistic approach. | (Calculated from TTM Financials, August 21, 2025). |
| **Tax Rate** | **23.5%.** Based on the TTM effective tax rate. This is a reasonable long-term assumption as it reflects the company's recent tax position. | (Calculated from StockAnalysis TTM Data, August 21, 2025). |
| **Capital Expenditures** | **15.8% of Revenue.** The midpoint of full-year guidance ($625M) is 15.5% of TTM revenue. The historical average is slightly higher. A 15.8% of revenue assumption balances guidance with historical spending patterns. | (Boyd Gaming Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, August 5, 2025). |
| **Change in Working Capital** | **-2.9% of Revenue Change.** This is based on the TTM relationship between change in working capital and change in revenue. | (Calculated from TTM Financials, August 21, 2025). |
| **Stock-Based Compensation** | **0.83% of Revenue.** Based on the TTM ratio of SBC to revenue, grown in line with revenue projections. | (Calculated from TTM Financials, August 21, 2025). |
| **Diluted Shares** | **83.7 million.** The latest reported diluted weighted-average shares outstanding are used for the final per-share calculation. | (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025, p. 4). |

### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation

| (USD Millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,088.4 | $4,149.7 | $4,212.0 | $4,275.1 | $4,339.3 |
| EBIT | $973.0 | $987.6 | $1,002.4 | $1,017.5 | $1,032.8 |
| NOPAT | $744.4 | $755.5 | $766.9 | $778.4 | $790.1 |
| D&A | $285.9 | $290.2 | $294.6 | $299.0 | $303.5 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($33.9) | ($34.4) | ($35.0) | ($35.5) | ($36.0) |
| Capital Expenditures | ($646.0) | ($655.7) | ($665.5) | ($675.5) | ($685.6) |
| Change in NWC | ($1.7) | ($1.8) | ($1.8) | ($1.8) | ($1.9) |
| **FCFF** | **$348.6** | **$353.9** | **$359.2** | **$364.6** | **$370.1** |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is calculated to determine the appropriate discount rate for future free cash flows.

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | The current yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note. (YCharts, August 21, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.00% | A standard assumption for the U.S. market, reflecting the long-term excess return expected by investors over the risk-free rate. |
| Beta (Î²) | 1.24 | A public beta that reflects the stock's volatility relative to the broader market; a beta >1 suggests higher volatility and thus higher risk. (MarketBeat, August 18, 2025). |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **10.49%** | **Formula: Ke = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium** |
| | | |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | | |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 5.36% | Calculated as TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt. ($191.2M / $3,568.2M). (Calculated from TTM Financials, August 21, 2025). |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 4.10% | **Formula: Kd * (1 - Tax Rate)** |
| | | |
| **Capital Structure** | | |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $7,001.3M | Calculated as 83.7M shares * $83.65 (assumed current price). (Calculated August 21, 2025). |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $3,568.2M | Latest reported total debt balance. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025). |
| Total Capital (V) | $10,569.5M | **Formula: E + D** |
| Weight of Equity (E/V) | 66.2% | |
| Weight of Debt (D/V) | 33.8% | |
| | | |
| **WACC** | **8.33%** | **Formula: WACC = (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-t))** |

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

The Gordon Growth method is used to calculate the terminal value, representing the present value of all subsequent cash flows.

*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This rate is chosen as a realistic long-term growth expectation, in line with long-run inflation estimates, and appropriate for a mature company.
*   **Terminal Value (Gordon Growth):**
    *   **Formula:** TV = (FCFF in Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Calculation:** ($370.1 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0833 - 0.025) = **$6,549.9M**

*   **Cross-Check (Exit Multiple Method):**
    *   TTM EBITDA = $1,240M. Year 5 EBITDA is projected to be $1,343M (growing at 1.5% annually).
    *   A conservative 5-year historical median EV/EBITDA multiple of 6.5x is assumed.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple):** $1,343M * 6.5 = **$8,729.5M**

*   **Conclusion:** As per the instructions to choose the more conservative figure, the **$6,549.9M** terminal value from the Gordon Growth method will be used.

### I) ONE-PARAGRAPH RISK NOTES

The base-case valuation is exposed to several key risks. First, the casino industry is highly sensitive to the macroeconomic environment; a recession would significantly impact discretionary consumer spending and gaming revenues. Second, the increasing legalization and adoption of online gaming and sports betting presents both an opportunity and a threat, potentially cannibalizing revenue from traditional brick-and-mortar operations if not managed effectively. Third, the company operates in a highly regulated industry, and changes to gaming laws or tax structures in key jurisdictions could adversely affect profitability. Finally, the company's significant debt load, while manageable, could become a burden if interest rates rise or if cash flows decline unexpectedly.

final answer is 32.35 $
