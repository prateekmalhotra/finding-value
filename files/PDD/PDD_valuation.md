### One-paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Intensifying Competition:** The Chinese e-commerce market is highly competitive, and increased investment from rivals like Alibaba and JD.com could pressure PDD's growth and margins. 2) **Regulatory Scrutiny:** PDD faces ongoing regulatory risks both within China and internationally (e.g., related to its Temu platform), which could lead to fines, operational changes, or market access restrictions. 3) **Geopolitical Tensions:** As a company with significant global operations, PDD is exposed to geopolitical risks and trade policy changes that could disrupt its supply chain and international expansion. 4) **Slowing Growth:** As acknowledged by management, the company's growth is slowing, and if this deceleration is faster than anticipated, the valuation would be negatively impacted.

final answer is 145.74 $
