Company: ASML Holding N.V., August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 20-F for FY2024, Q2 2025 earnings release and transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML is the sole global supplier of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which are essential for manufacturing advanced semiconductor chips. The long-term demand for advanced and mature nodes is driven by global megatrends like AI, the energy transition, and electrification. ASML ended Q2 2025 with a backlog of €39 billion, providing significant forward visibility. The company projects a market opportunity of €44 billion to €60 billion by 2030, indicating a substantial runway for growth as new fabrication plants are built and existing ones are equipped with next-generation tools like High-NA EUV.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML's strategy is fundamentally based on continuous innovation to enable Moore's Law. The company invested €4.0 billion in R&D in 2024, representing a significant portion of its revenue. Its primary focus is on the next generation of lithography, High-NA EUV (the EXE platform), which will enable chipmakers to produce even more advanced semiconductors. The first High-NA system was shipped in December 2023, demonstrating a clear commitment to a product roadmap that extends beyond the current generation of EUV tools.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML’s R&D is highly effective, demonstrated by its near-monopoly in the high-end lithography market. Despite significant R&D spending (around 14-15% of 2024 net sales), the output is industry-defining technology that competitors have been unable to replicate. The successful commercialization of EUV technology after decades of investment, and now the shipment of the first High-NA EUV system, are testaments to its R&D effectiveness. This technological leadership creates a powerful competitive moat and allows for premium pricing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML's "sales" process is better characterized as a deep, long-term technical collaboration with a very small number of key customers (e.g., TSMC, Samsung, Intel). Given the strategic importance and high cost of its systems (€150M+ for EUV), the sales cycle is long and deeply integrated with customer technology roadmaps. The company's massive and sustained order backlog (€39 billion as of Q2 2025) is the ultimate evidence of its effectiveness in securing long-term commitments from all key players in the advanced semiconductor industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML consistently demonstrates strong profitability due to its unique market position. For the full year 2024, the company reported a gross margin of 51.3% and an operating margin of 31.5%. These margins are exceptionally high for an equipment manufacturer and reflect the immense value and pricing power associated with its technology. In its Q2 2025 results, the company guided for a gross margin between 50% and 51% for Q3 2025, showing sustained high profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.asml.com/en/investors/financial-results

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML focuses on several levers to maintain and improve its strong margins. This includes a product mix shift towards higher-margin EUV and upcoming High-NA EUV systems, which command premium prices. Furthermore, the company is growing its Installed Base Management business, which provides services, upgrades, and software to its vast installed base, generating high-margin, recurring revenue. In its Q2 2025 earnings call, management reiterated its focus on cost management and operational efficiency to navigate supply chain variables.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML has demonstrated strong and stable executive leadership. A planned succession occurred in April 2024, with Christophe Fouquet taking over as CEO from Peter Wennink, who had served for over a decade. The transition was announced well in advance, and Mr. Fouquet is a company veteran who was previously the Chief Business Officer, ensuring continuity. The long tenure of the top management team and the smooth transition point to stable and effective executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML’s management structure shows significant depth beyond the CEO. The Board of Management includes the CEO, CFO (Roger Dassen), and CTO (Martin van den Brink), all with extensive experience. The recent CEO succession, where a long-time internal leader was promoted, is strong evidence of a deep bench of talent that has been cultivated within the company. This internal promotion pipeline mitigates key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML's financial reporting is audited by KPMG, which issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024. The annual report also contains a management report on internal controls, which did not identify any material weaknesses. The company provides detailed segment reporting for its logic and memory businesses, as well as by system type and service revenue, indicating robust internal accounting controls.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML's financial position is exceptionally strong. The company is highly profitable and generates significant free cash flow. As of its Q2 2025 results, it holds a strong net cash position. Instead of issuing shares, ASML has a history of returning capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buyback programs, which are anti-dilutive. Its robust cash generation is more than sufficient to fund its R&D and capital expenditure needs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.asml.com/en/investors/financial-results

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ASML's management team is widely respected for its direct and transparent communication style. In earnings calls and presentations, they speak openly about complex topics, including cyclical industry downturns, supply chain constraints, and the impact of geopolitical issues like export controls. For instance, management has been upfront about the revenue impact of Dutch and US export regulations, providing clarity to investors even when the news is unfavorable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://discountingcashflows.com/company/ASML/transcripts/

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant governance issues, scandals, or major regulatory actions against ASML or its management. The company's annual report details a comprehensive code of conduct and adherence to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. The section on legal proceedings in its 2024 20-F filing does not reveal any issues that would call the integrity of its management into question.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
ASML scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its unique and powerful position as a technological monopolist in a critical growth industry. Its primary strengths are its insurmountable competitive moat in EUV technology, a clear roadmap for future growth with High-NA systems, and exceptionally strong financial characteristics, including high margins and robust cash flow. The management team is stable, transparent, and has a proven track record of long-term strategic execution. The two variables most likely to change this score in the next 12–24 months are geopolitical risk and cyclical industry dynamics. An escalation of export controls targeting China could impact the "Long Runway" thesis, while a deeper-than-expected semiconductor downturn could pressure "Worthwhile Profit Margins." However, given the current strong standing, no "Yes" answer appears at immediate risk of flipping.

fisher score is 15 / 15
