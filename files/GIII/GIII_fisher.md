G-III Apparel Group, Ltd., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025; Earnings Call Transcript list dated June 6, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III is executing a strategic pivot from its historically significant, but expiring, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses to its portfolio of owned brands. The company is investing heavily in its key owned brands like DKNY, Donna Karan, and Karl Lagerfeld, which accounted for approximately 52% of net sales in fiscal 2025, up from 47% in fiscal 2024. The relaunch of Donna Karan in Spring 2024 was the company's "most successful launch to date," and management sees significant opportunity for global growth. G-III is also expanding its licensed portfolio with new agreements for Converse and BCBG expected to launch in Fall 2025, and recently launched Nautica, Halston, and Champion, indicating a clear strategy to replace and grow revenues. Further, a new strategic investment in AWWG is designed to accelerate international expansion in Europe and other key markets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions demonstrate a strong commitment to developing new revenue streams to offset the planned wind-down of its PVH licenses. In fiscal years 2024 and 2025, G-III signed five major new licensing agreements: Nautica, Halston, Champion, Converse, and BCBG. The company also executed a significant brand relaunch of its owned Donna Karan brand in Spring 2024, backed by the "largest and most visible marketing investment" in the company's history. The full acquisition of the Karl Lagerfeld brand in May 2022 and the strategic investment in AWWG in May 2024 to build a European operational platform further underscore a forward-looking strategy focused on building a durable, owned-brand-centric portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III, like most apparel companies, does not report traditional R&D expenses. Its investment in development is reflected in design, merchandising, and marketing, which are embedded within Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses. The 10-K does not provide a specific breakdown of these costs, making a direct comparison to peers on an R&D-to-sales basis impossible. While the successful relaunch of Donna Karan and the acquisition of new licenses suggest effective product development and marketing efforts, the lack of quantifiable R&D metrics prevents a definitive assessment of its effectiveness relative to size.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III maintains a diversified distribution network, selling products to approximately 1,600 customers, including major department stores, specialty stores, and mass merchants. The company has deep, long-standing relationships with key retailers; sales to its top ten customers accounted for 69.6% of net sales in fiscal 2025, with Macy's (18.0%), TJX Companies (13.2%), and Ross Stores (12.6%) being the largest. The ability to manage these large, demanding wholesale accounts while simultaneously growing a direct-to-consumer and digital business for its owned brands (DKNY, Karl Lagerfeld) indicates a sophisticated and effective sales organization capable of operating across multiple channels.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2025, G-III reported a gross profit margin of 40.8% and an operating profit margin of 9.1%. The gross margin improved from 40.1% in fiscal 2024. G-III's operating margin of 9.1% is comparable to that of key competitor PVH Corp., which reported a GAAP operating margin of 8.9% for its fiscal year 2024. This performance is particularly noteworthy as the company is navigating a major business transition away from high-volume licensed brands. The ability to maintain margins in line with peers during this period suggests a worthwhile profit structure.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's primary strategy for margin improvement is shifting its sales mix towards its owned brands, which do not incur royalty expenses. The company explicitly states that the gross profit percentage in fiscal 2025 was "positively impacted by a shift in sales to product related to our owned brands which have no royalty costs." This transition is evident as owned brands' share of revenue increased from 41% in fiscal 2023 to 52% in fiscal 2025. Additionally, the company is executing a turnaround plan for its North American retail segment, which reduced its operating loss from $30.5 million in fiscal 2024 to $14.0 million in fiscal 2025, contributing positively to consolidated margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** G-III Apparel Group, Ltd. Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, filed March 24, 2025. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/821002/000155837025003540/giii-20250131x10k.htm]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of January 31, 2025, G-III employed approximately 3,500 full-time and 1,100 part-time staff. The company notes that it employs both union and non-union workforces and states that it believes its "relationships with our employees are positive." Crucially, the company also reports that it has "not experienced any interruption to our operations due to a labor disagreement with our employees." This lack of operational disruption is a strong indicator of stable labor relations. The "Human Capital" section also details commitments to diversity, with women comprising 73% of the overall workforce and 63% of the leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at G-III demonstrates remarkable stability and long tenure, which is indicative of strong internal relations. Morris Goldfarb, the Chairman and CEO, has been with the company for over 50 years. Other key executives, including Sammy Aaron (Vice Chairman and President), Neal Nackman (CFO), and Jeffrey Goldfarb (EVP), have been with the company for approximately 20 years or more. This long-term continuity in senior leadership suggests a cohesive and stable executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's leadership team extends beyond its long-tenured CEO. The executive team includes a Vice Chairman & President (Sammy Aaron), a Chief Financial Officer (Neal Nackman), and an Executive Vice President (Jeffrey Goldfarb), all with deep institutional knowledge. Furthermore, the company strengthened its management depth by hiring Dana Perlman as Chief Growth and Operations Officer in January 2024; Ms. Perlman brought over 20 years of industry experience, including a recent role as Chief Strategy Officer at PVH Corp. This blend of long-serving insiders and experienced external hires points to a management team with considerable depth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Form 10-K for the year ended January 31, 2025, management concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were "not effective" due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness was identified within the Karl Lagerfeld (KLH) subsidiary and relates to "the operating effectiveness of controls related to information technology general controls (“ITGCs”) over business applications that support the Company’s financial reporting processes." The company's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, also issued an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of internal controls. The existence of a declared material weakness forces a negative conclusion on this point.
**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** G-III's key distinctive feature is its mastery of a hybrid model, operating as a brand owner, brand manager, and licensee. The company's core competency is built on "expertise in design, sourcing, distribution and marketing" across a portfolio of over 30 brands. This allows it to serve a wide range of price points and distribution channels, from department stores to off-price retailers. The ability to successfully manage this complexity, particularly its vast sourcing network (sourcing 76% of product from Vietnam, China, and Indonesia in fiscal 2025) and relationships with ~1,600 customers, serves as a significant competitive advantage and barrier to entry. This operational excellence is a crucial clue to its long-term viability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's current strategy is explicitly focused on long-range profit and growth, even at the expense of significant near-term revenue. G-III is proactively managing the multi-year wind-down of its licenses for Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, which together represented 34% of sales in fiscal 2025. Instead of maximizing short-term profits from these licenses, it is reinvesting heavily in its owned brands through marketing (Donna Karan relaunch), acquisitions (completing the Karl Lagerfeld purchase), and strategic partnerships (AWWG investment for international growth). These actions are designed to build a more profitable and durable business centered on owned brands, demonstrating a clear long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial actions indicate a strong position that avoids shareholder dilution. In August 2024, G-III redeemed the entire $400 million principal of its Senior Secured Notes using cash on hand and its revolving credit facility. The company is actively returning capital to shareholders, having repurchased 2.2 million shares for $60.0 million in fiscal 2025 under a 10 million share repurchase program. As of January 31, 2025, the company had $181.4 million in cash and approximately $600.0 million available under its credit facility. These actions demonstrate that the company is funding its growth strategy through cash from operations and debt, not dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides clear and direct disclosure regarding its most significant business challenge: the expiration of the Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger licenses. The "Management's Discussion and Analysis" section of the 10-K includes a dedicated subsection, "Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger Licenses," which explicitly tables the revenue contribution of the expiring licenses by year. Furthermore, the "Risk Factors" section extensively details the risks associated with this transition. This high level of transparency about a major headwind, rather than obscuring it, is strong evidence of management's candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's latest 10-K reveals no significant red flags that would question management's integrity. The "Legal Proceedings" section states that the company is not party to any proceeding that it believes would have a material adverse effect on the business. The company's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, has served in its role since 2000, indicating a long-term, stable relationship with its auditor. While the material weakness in controls (Point 10) is a serious issue, it was self-disclosed and is related to an acquired subsidiary, and there is no indication that it stems from a lack of integrity at the senior management level.
**Answer:** Yes

***
**Synthesis:**

G-III Apparel Group presents a strong profile under Fisher's framework, scoring well on its forward-looking strategy, stable management, and financial discipline. The company's primary strengths are its proactive and aggressive pivot towards a portfolio of owned brands (DKNY, Donna Karan, Karl Lagerfeld) and new licenses (Nautica, Halston, Converse) to create a long runway for growth beyond the expiration of its PVH licenses. This transition, combined with a healthy balance sheet, active share repurchases, and improving margins, demonstrates a clear long-range outlook. The primary negative is the self-disclosed material weakness in IT controls at its acquired Karl Lagerfeld subsidiary, which is a significant governance issue that must be resolved.

Over the next 12–24 months, the Fisher score will most likely be impacted by three variables: 1) the successful remediation of the material weakness in accounting controls, 2) the sales and margin performance of the relaunched Donna Karan brand and the new licensed brands launching in Fall 2025, and 3) the pace of international expansion through the AWWG partnership. Evidence of the successful integration of the Karl Lagerfeld IT systems would flip the "No" on Point 10. Quantifiable data on new brand performance and international revenue growth would further solidify the "Yes" on Points 1 and 2.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
