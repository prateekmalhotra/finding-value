**Synthesis:** Mattel scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly in its strategic shift to an IP-driven entertainment company. The success of the "Barbie" movie has validated this strategy and opened up significant new avenues for growth. The company's strong brand portfolio, improving financials, and experienced management team are all key positives. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company can demonstrate sustained success in its new entertainment ventures, and provide more transparency on its R&D effectiveness. A "No" on R&D Effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosure of R&D spending and its impact on revenue growth. Similarly, a "No" on Labor Relations could be flipped with the publication of metrics on employee satisfaction and retention.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
