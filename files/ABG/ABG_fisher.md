Asbury Automotive Group, Inc., analysis date August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Q2 2025 investor presentation.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury operates in the mature U.S. automotive retail market but is pursuing aggressive growth through consolidation. The company has a stated goal to reach $30 billion or more in revenue by 2030, a significant increase from $17.2 billion in 2024. This growth is driven by large-scale acquisitions, such as the 2023 purchase of Koons Automotive and the pending 2025 acquisition of The Herb Chambers Companies, which significantly expand Asbury's dealership footprint and revenue base. Additionally, the company is focused on growing its high-margin parts and service business and expanding its captive finance and insurance (F&I) provider, Total Care Auto (TCA), across its network.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury's management is actively investing in process and technology development to drive future sales. A primary initiative is the company's omni-channel platform, including its online sales tool "Clicklane," which aims to create a seamless "end-to-end" digital retailing experience for customers. The company is also committed to expanding the offerings of its captive F&I provider, TCA, across its entire dealership portfolio, which is expected to be completed in 2025 and increase profitability. The ongoing strategy of growth through major acquisitions further demonstrates a commitment to increasing sales potential.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an automotive retailer, Asbury does not have a traditional R&D budget for product manufacturing. Instead, its "R&D" equivalent is investment in technology and retail process innovation. The company's primary development effort is its "omni-channel" strategy, manifested in the Clicklane digital retail platform. This platform has shown tangible results, with record sales of 15,201 units in Q2 2024, a 33% year-over-year increase, proving its effectiveness during a critical CDK system outage. While specific investment figures are not consistently disclosed, the clear sales results from this platform indicate an effective use of development resources for a company of its size.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury's sales performance shows a mix of strengths and weaknesses. The company has demonstrated strong revenue growth, targeting $30 billion by 2030, largely through an aggressive and successful acquisition strategy. However, total company gross profit margin declined from 18.6% in 2023 to 17.2% in 2024, and same-store new vehicle gross profit saw a significant 22% drop. A major concern is the pending FTC enforcement action filed in August 2024, which alleges violations related to the sale of add-on products, casting doubt on the quality and integrity of its sales practices in certain areas.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144980/000114498025000077/abg-20241231.htm (February 26, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury's gross profit margin was 17.2% for the full year 2024, a decrease from 18.6% in 2023. This is comparable to, and in some cases slightly below, its primary competitors. For example, AutoNation's average gross margin for 2024 was 18.23%, while Lithia Motors' gross margin was 15.3%. While Asbury's margins are within the industry range, the downward trend and position relative to the highest-performing peers suggest they are adequate but not superior. The high-margin Parts & Service segment is a positive contributor, accounting for 45.8% of gross profit in 2024.
**Answer:** No

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing several initiatives to improve profit margins. A key strategy is leveraging its scale to centralize back-office functions and streamline operations, thereby reducing SG&A expenses as a percentage of gross profit. The company is also systematically rolling out its own F&I provider, TCA, across all dealerships, which is expected to generate higher profits than selling third-party F&I products. Furthermore, there is a strong focus on growing the high-margin parts and service business to offset the more cyclical and lower-margin new and used vehicle sales segments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144980/000114498025000077/abg-20241231.htm (February 26, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury's public disclosures paint a positive picture of its labor relations. The company states it offers competitive compensation and benefits, including equity awards for frontline employees, and invests in training and development with a goal to promote from within. As of December 31, 2024, none of its approximately 15,000 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements, and the company believes it has good relations with them. The "Asbury Cares" program, providing 40 hours of paid volunteer time, further indicates a positive corporate culture. Without evidence of significant labor disputes or high turnover, the available information is positive.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Asbury appears stable and aligned. The core leadership, including CEO David Hult and other senior VPs, has been in place for several years, overseeing a period of significant growth and strategic acquisitions. The consistent messaging around the company's long-term revenue goals and capital allocation strategy in filings and investor calls suggests a cohesive and focused executive team. There is no public evidence of significant executive turnover, infighting, or misalignment that would indicate poor executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144980/000114498025000077/abg-20241231.htm (February 26, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury's management structure appears to have functional depth. The company's 10-K and corporate governance documents list a full suite of senior executives beyond the CEO, covering key areas like operations, finance, and marketing. Operationally, the company empowers local leadership, with the General Manager of each dealership responsible for the day-to-day performance and personnel of their specific location. This decentralized model requires a deep bench of capable operators at the dealership level, which is essential for successfully integrating large acquisitions like Koons and Herb Chambers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144980/000114498025000077/abg-20241231.htm (February 26, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury's accounting controls have a significant, officially disclosed weakness. In its 2024 10-K, management concluded that there was a "material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting" as of December 31, 2024. This weakness stemmed from deficiencies in IT general controls at a third-party software vendor for the newly acquired Koons dealership group. An adverse opinion on internal control over financial reporting was issued by their independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP. A disclosed material weakness represents a fundamental failure in accounting controls.
**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator in automotive retail is the ability to generate high-margin revenue streams to offset the cyclicality of vehicle sales. Asbury's ownership of Total Care Auto (TCA), a captive F&I product provider, is a significant competitive advantage. Owning the F&I provider allows Asbury to capture the full profit stream from these products, rather than just a commission, which should improve margins as TCA is rolled out across the entire network. Additionally, the company's aggressive and successful execution of large-scale acquisitions demonstrates a core competency in consolidating a fragmented industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a clear long-range focus. The company has established a strategic plan to reach revenues of "$30 billion or more by 2030." This goal is being pursued through major acquisitions that require significant upfront capital and integration efforts, which can depress short-term results. Furthermore, the multi-year rollout of their captive F&I provider, TCA, involves forgoing some immediate third-party commission revenue in favor of building a more profitable, long-term income stream. This willingness to invest heavily in acquisitions and internal initiatives for future growth demonstrates a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144980/000114498025000077/abg-20241231.htm (February 26, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Asbury's financial strategy strongly favors shareholder returns over dilution. The company is actively repurchasing its own stock, having bought back $183.0 million worth of shares in 2024 and approving a $400 million repurchase authorization in May 2024. Major acquisitions, like the $1.5 billion Koons deal, have been funded through debt and cash on hand, not by issuing new equity. With a transaction-adjusted net leverage ratio of 2.85x at year-end 2024, the company is operating within its target range and appears to have sufficient access to debt markets to fund its growth plans without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its communications. The 2024 10-K provides transparent and direct disclosure of significant challenges, including the material weakness in internal accounting controls and the details of the FTC investigation into their sales practices. In the MD&A section, the company also clearly quantifies the negative financial impact of external events like Hurricane Milton and the CDK cyber-incident. This willingness to openly discuss negative events in official filings indicates a culture of transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The integrity of management's practices is currently under question due to regulatory action. On August 16, 2024, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initiated an administrative proceeding against Asbury and three of its dealerships. The action alleges violations of the FTC Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act related to the sale of add-on products. While the company is vigorously disputing the allegations, a formal enforcement action from a major federal regulator raises significant concerns about the integrity of the company's sales and finance practices, which are core to its business.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1144980/000114498025000077/abg-20241231.htm (February 26, 2025)

---
**Synthesis**

Asbury Automotive Group scores positively on its clear long-range growth strategy, driven by large-scale acquisitions and investments in its omni-channel platform and captive F&I provider. The company has strong management depth, stable executive relations, and a commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks rather than equity dilution. However, the analysis reveals three significant red flags: a pending FTC enforcement action questioning the integrity of its sales practices, a disclosed material weakness in internal accounting controls following a major acquisition, and profit margins that are declining and not best-in-class.

The Fisher score will most likely change based on the resolution of the FTC investigation and the remediation of the material weakness. A favorable settlement or dismissal of the FTC case would flip point 15 to "Yes." Evidence of successful remediation of the internal control weakness in the next 10-K would be required to change point 10. A sustained improvement in gross margins relative to peers, driven by the TCA rollout and operational efficiencies, would be needed to reconsider point 5.

fisher score is 11 / 15
