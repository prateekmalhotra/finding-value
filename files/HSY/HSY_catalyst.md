### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

---

**1. Catalyst Title:** Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative Delivers Margin Expansion
*   **Type:** Operational / Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** A multi-year productivity program approved in February 2024 designed to optimize supply chain and SG&A spend, simplify processes, and generate long-term savings. The company expects total pre-tax costs of $200-$250 million through 2026 to achieve ongoing annual savings of approximately $300 million.
*   **Mechanism:** Realized cost savings will directly improve operating margins. As these savings flow to the bottom line, they will increase Earnings Per Share (EPS), which, assuming a constant P/E multiple, will drive the share price higher.
*   **Timing:** Q3 2025 - Q2 2026. The program is already underway, and the incremental benefits should become more visible in upcoming quarterly earnings reports.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** The company realizes $75 million of the targeted $300 million annual savings over the next 12 months. After a 21% tax rate, this adds ~$59 million to net income.
    *   **Base Case:** The company realizes $125 million of the targeted savings over the next 12 months. After a 21% tax rate, this adds ~$99 million to net income.
    *   **High Case:** The company realizes $175 million of the targeted savings over the next 12 months. After a 21% tax rate, this adds ~$138 million to net income.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** **Medium (5-15%)**.
    *   *Basis:* Using the FY2024 Net Income of $2,221.2 million as a base, the Base Case scenario represents a ~4.5% increase in net income. Given this is a multi-year program demonstrating disciplined cost control amidst inflation, the market may award a higher multiple, leading to a 5-15% potential share price impact as the savings are proven out.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** **90%**. The program has been formally approved by the Board and specific financial targets have been disclosed. The primary uncertainty is the exact timing and magnitude of savings realized within the near-term window.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful execution of workforce reductions and process changes without disrupting core operations.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reported operating profit margin vs. prior year. (Quarterly 10-Q)
    *   Management commentary on progress toward the ~$300M savings goal. (Earnings Calls)
    *   Reported business realignment costs; staying within the $200-$250M budget. (Quarterly 10-Q)
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Execution delays or higher-than-expected implementation costs could disappoint investors.
    *   Operational disruptions from restructuring could temporarily harm productivity.
    *   Savings could be reinvested in the business rather than flowing to the bottom line, muting the immediate EPS impact.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** **Watch**. Monitor quarterly earnings for evidence of margin improvement directly attributed to this program. Positive results could make it a "Buy."

---

**2. Catalyst Title:** Accelerated Execution of Share Repurchase Authorization
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In December 2023, the Board of Directors approved a $500 million share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $470 million remains available under this authorization.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of shares outstanding, which directly increases EPS. This action also provides a source of demand for the stock and signals management's confidence that the shares are undervalued.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with potential for acceleration in Q3 2025 - Q2 2026. Management has full discretion on the timing of execution.
*   **Quantification:** (Assuming a share price of ~$180)
    *   **Low Case:** Repurchase of $150 million in stock (~0.83 million shares).
    *   **Base Case:** Repurchase of $250 million in stock (~1.39 million shares).
    *   **High Case:** Repurchase of the full remaining $470 million in stock (~2.61 million shares).
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** **Small (2-8%)**.
    *   *Basis:* Using the 147.8 million Common shares outstanding as of Feb 10, 2025, the Base Case would reduce the share count by ~0.9%, providing a direct boost to EPS. The larger impact comes from the signal of confidence and the creation of demand for the shares, which could drive the price higher.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** **85%**. The program is fully authorized and funded. The only uncertainty is the pace of execution, which could be influenced by market conditions and alternative uses of capital.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Management's view of the stock's valuation versus other capital allocation priorities like M&A or debt repayment.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" section in quarterly 10-Q filings.
    *   Cash flow from financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.
    *   Changes in shares outstanding on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Management may choose to preserve cash for a large acquisition, slowing the pace of buybacks.
    *   Repurchases may be executed at high prices, destroying shareholder value.
    *   The impact could be offset by dilution from executive compensation plans.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** **Watch**. Look for accelerated buyback activity in the next 10-Q filing as a bullish signal.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

---

**1. Catalyst Title:** Successful Transformation into a "Leading Snacking Powerhouse"
*   **Type:** M&A / Strategy
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Management has stated its vision is to be a "leading snacking powerhouse," expanding beyond its confectionery core. This strategy involves both organic growth in its salty snacks portfolio (SkinnyPop, Dot's Pretzels) and bolt-on acquisitions like Sour Strips (acquired November 2024).
*   **Mechanism:** Successfully entering and scaling in adjacent, higher-growth snack categories will diversify Hershey's revenue base, accelerate top-line growth, and reduce its dependence on the volatile cocoa market. This could lead to a re-rating of the company's valuation multiple as it is viewed more as a diversified food company than a pure-play chocolate manufacturer.
*   **Timing:** Q3 2026 - Q3 2030. This is a multi-year strategic shift.
*   **Quantification:** (Illustrative Scenario)
    *   **Base Scenario:** The North America Salty Snacks segment grows from 10.1% of 2024 revenue ($1.14B) to 20% of a larger revenue base in 2029. Assuming total company revenue grows at 4% annually to ~$13.6B, this implies the salty snacks segment would need to reach ~$2.7B in revenue (a ~19% CAGR).
    *   **P&L Impact:** Achieving this scale should improve segment margins from 17.6% (2024 10-K) towards the corporate average through efficiencies, driving significant profit growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** **Large (>30%)**.
    *   *Basis:* A successful transition would fundamentally change Hershey's growth profile and risk factors (especially cocoa dependency). This could justify a significant expansion of its P/E multiple over the long term, in addition to the underlying earnings growth.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** **60%**. The strategy is clearly articulated and initial steps have been taken. However, M&A and integration are fraught with risk, and competing in the broader snack market against established players like PepsiCo is a significant challenge.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Ability to identify and acquire attractive snack brands at reasonable valuations; successful integration of acquired brands and leveraging Hershey's distribution network.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Revenue growth and profit margin of the North America Salty Snacks segment.
    *   Announcements of new acquisitions in the snacking category.
    *   Management commentary on the "snacking powerhouse" strategy.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Overpaying for acquisitions, leading to goodwill impairment and value destruction.
    *   Failure to effectively integrate new brands, leading to operational inefficiencies.
    *   Intense competition from larger, more established players in the salty snack category.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** **Buy**. This is the central pillar of the long-term equity story. The potential for a strategic re-rating is significant if execution is successful.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative (Base Case)**
*   **Logic:** Quantify the EPS impact from the Base Case scenario of realizing $125M in pre-tax savings.
*   **Formula:** (Pre-Tax Savings \* (1 - Tax Rate)) / Diluted Shares Outstanding
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Pre-Tax Savings: $125,000,000 (Analyst Base Case Estimate)
    *   Tax Rate: 10.2% (Effective tax rate for 2024 from 10-K)
    *   Diluted Shares Outstanding (Common): ~147.8M shares (as of Feb 10, 2025) + ~54.6M Class B shares = ~202.4M total shares.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   After-Tax Savings = $125,000,000 \* (1 - 0.102) = $112,250,000
    *   EPS Impact = $112,250,000 / 202,400,000 shares = **~$0.55 per share**
*   **Conclusion:** This single program could add over $0.55 to annual EPS, a significant boost to the 2024 diluted EPS of $10.92.

**2. Share Repurchase Program (Base Case)**
*   **Logic:** Calculate the EPS accretion from the Base Case scenario of repurchasing $250M of stock.
*   **Formula:** (2024 Net Income / New Share Count) - 2024 EPS
*   **Inputs:**
    *   2024 Net Income: $2,221,200,000
    *   Initial Share Count: ~202,400,000 shares
    *   Shares Repurchased: $250,000,000 / $180/share = ~1,388,889 shares (Base Case Estimate)
    *   New Share Count: 202,400,000 - 1,388,889 = 201,011,111 shares
*   **Calculation:**
    *   New EPS = $2,221,200,000 / 201,011,111 = $11.05
    *   2024 EPS = $10.92
    *   EPS Accretion = $11.05 - $10.92 = **~$0.13 per share**
*   **Conclusion:** The base case buyback alone provides a tangible ~$0.13 lift to EPS, independent of operational performance.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term outlook for Hershey's stock is cautiously optimistic, with a positive net catalyst balance. The "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative" provides a clear, high-probability path to significant margin expansion and EPS growth over the next 12 months. This operational catalyst is complemented by the financial catalyst of an active and well-funded share repurchase program, which should provide support for the share price and enhance EPS. However, these positive drivers are countered by significant macro headwinds, including extreme cocoa price volatility (up ~130% in 2024 per the 10-K) and shifts in consumer behavior due to "cost fatigue," which are creating volume pressures. The consistent pattern of insider sales is also a point of caution. The market signal is therefore mixed: while internal, company-controlled actions are positive, external market forces present substantial risks.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Extreme Commodity Price Inflation:** A continued surge in cocoa prices, which rose ~130% in 2024, could completely overwhelm cost-saving initiatives, severely compressing gross margins and forcing price increases that destroy volume.
2.  **Sustained Decline in Consumer Demand:** If "cost fatigue" and shifts in consumer spending away from premium snacks intensify, the resulting volume declines in the core North America Confectionery business could more than offset any gains from cost savings or buybacks.
3.  **Failed M&A or Integration:** A large, poorly executed acquisition as part of the "snacking powerhouse" strategy could lead to massive goodwill write-downs, operational disruption, and a loss of investor confidence that negates all other positive factors.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

I recommend a **Watch** rating for The Hershey Company, with a bias to Buy on any signs of success from its primary catalyst. The near-term "Advancing Agility & Automation Initiative" offers a clear path to an estimated +5-15% upside as margin improvements are realized over the next 12 months. However, this is balanced by severe commodity risks. The single most important indicator to monitor is the company's gross margin performance in its upcoming quarterly reports; a stable or expanding margin will be the first sign that cost savings are successfully offsetting historic cocoa inflation.
