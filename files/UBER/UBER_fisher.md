**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's research and development expenses were $3.109 billion in 2024, representing 7% of revenue. While this is a significant investment, the company has a track record of launching new products and features. The effectiveness of these efforts is demonstrated by the continued growth in Monthly Active Platform Consumers (MAPCs) and Trips.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's "sales organization" is unconventional, as it primarily relies on its platform to attract and retain customers. The company's sales and marketing expenses were $4.337 billion in 2024. The growth in MAPCs to 171 million in Q4 2024 suggests the effectiveness of its platform and marketing efforts.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's income from operations was $2.799 billion in 2024, representing an operating margin of 6%. The company's profitability is a recent development, and its margins are still relatively thin. However, the positive trend in profitability is a significant improvement.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber is focused on improving profit margins through a combination of strategies. These include increasing the scale and efficiency of its network, leveraging its technology to reduce costs, and growing higher-margin businesses like advertising. The company has also demonstrated a willingness to exit unprofitable markets.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's relationship with its drivers remains a significant challenge. The company faces ongoing legal and regulatory battles over driver classification. While Uber has taken steps to improve driver relations, such as providing more transparency and benefits, the issue is far from resolved.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's executive team has seen significant turnover in the past, but the current leadership team, led by CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, has been relatively stable. The company's 2024 10-K outlines the experience and qualifications of its executive officers.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly traded company, Uber is subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and is required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from management on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315125000008/uber-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315125000008/uber-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's key competitive advantage is its massive network of drivers and consumers, which creates a powerful network effect. This scale allows Uber to offer a more reliable and efficient service than smaller competitors. The company is also leveraging its network to expand into new verticals, such as advertising and healthcare.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber has historically prioritized growth over profitability, investing heavily in new markets and technologies. While the company has recently turned profitable, it continues to invest in long-term growth initiatives, such as autonomous vehicles and new delivery verticals. This indicates a willingness to trade short-term profits for long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber generated $6.895 billion in free cash flow in 2024 and had $5.9 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year. The company also has a share repurchase program in place, which reduces the risk of dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315125000008/uber-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315125000008/uber-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Uber's past is marked by a series of scandals that led to the ousting of its co-founder and former CEO. However, the current management team has made a concerted effort to change the company's culture and improve its reputation. While the company still faces legal and regulatory challenges, there is no evidence to suggest that the current management team lacks integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315125000008/uber-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000154315125000008/uber-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**Synthesis:** Uber's Fisher Score of 14/15 reflects its strong position as a market leader with a long runway for growth. The company's recent turn to profitability is a major positive, and its commitment to ongoing development and innovation is a key strength. The primary area of concern is labor relations, which remains a significant challenge. A resolution to the driver classification issue would likely have the biggest impact on the score in the next 12-24 months. Evidence of improved driver satisfaction and a more stable regulatory environment would be needed to flip the "No" to a "Yes".

fisher score is 14 / 15
