**1. Catalyst Title:** Successful Integration and Synergies from Recent Acquisitions
*   **Type:** M&A / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has recently acquired OddsJam, OpticOdds, and Spotlight.Vegas. The successful integration of these businesses will diversify revenue streams and enhance the company's sports data and marketing capabilities.
*   **Mechanism:** Increased revenue and EBITDA from new business lines, cross-selling opportunities to existing customers, and cost synergies from integrating operations would lead to higher earnings and a re-rating of the stock. The acquisition of Spotlight.Vegas is expected to yield $8 million in net revenue and $1.4 million in incremental Adjusted EBITDA in 2026.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026

*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Minimal buyback execution.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Full execution of the $10 million expansion.

### **Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Successful Integration of Acquisitions:**
*   **Assumptions:** Base case assumes the company achieves its full-year 2025 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $63 million (midpoint). A 15% increase in EBITDA from synergies and growth from acquisitions would result in an adjusted EBITDA of $72.45 million.
*   **Valuation:** Applying a 10x EV/EBITDA multiple (in line with industry peers) to the increased EBITDA results in an enterprise value of $724.5 million. This represents a significant upside from the current enterprise value.

**2. New State Launches:**
*   **Assumptions:** In a high-growth scenario where a large state legalizes online sports betting, Gambling.com Group's revenue could increase by an incremental $20 million in the first year. Assuming a 35% adjusted EBITDA margin, this would add $7 million to adjusted EBITDA.
*   **Valuation:** Applying a 10x EV/EBITDA multiple, this would add $70 million to the company's enterprise value, representing a significant increase from its current valuation.

### **Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Gambling.com Group are predominantly positive. The successful integration of recent acquisitions, coupled with an expanded share repurchase program, should provide a tailwind for the stock over the next 0–12 months. The market has reacted positively to the strong Q2 2025 earnings, and the company's guidance for the full year is encouraging. While there are risks related to the integration of acquisitions, the potential upside appears to outweigh the downside.

### **Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A significant Google algorithm update:** As a performance marketing company, Gambling.com Group is highly dependent on search engine rankings. A negative algorithm update could severely impact traffic and revenue.
2.  **Regulatory setbacks:** A reversal of the trend towards online gambling legalization in the U.S. or the implementation of unfavorable regulations in key markets could hinder growth.
3.  **Failed M&A integration:** The inability to successfully integrate recent acquisitions could lead to a failure to realize synergies and a drain on resources.

### **Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on the analysis, Gambling.com Group presents a compelling investment case with several near-term catalysts. The successful integration of recent acquisitions is the most significant catalyst, with the potential for a 15-25% upside in the share price. The most important indicator to monitor is the company's ability to deliver on its full-year 2025 guidance and demonstrate strong revenue and EBITDA contributions from its newly acquired businesses.
