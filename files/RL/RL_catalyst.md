### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Accelerated Share Repurchase Execution:**
*   **Formula:** (Net Income / (Shares Outstanding - Shares Repurchased)) \* P/E Multiple
*   **Assumptions:** Net Income = $750M, Shares Outstanding = 62.1M, P/E Multiple = 15x, Average Repurchase Price = $180
*   **Scenario:** Repurchase of $1B in shares = 5.6M shares repurchased.
*   **Calculation:** ($750M / (62.1M - 5.6M)) \* 15 = $199.1 per share, a **10.6%** increase from a $180 baseline.

**2. "Next Generation Transformation" Project:**
*   **Formula:** ((Operating Income + Cost Savings) \* (1 - Tax Rate)) / Shares Outstanding) \* P/E Multiple
*   **Assumptions:** Operating Income = $932.1M, Cost Savings = $100M, Tax Rate = 22%, Shares Outstanding = 62.1M, P/E Multiple = 15x
*   **Calculation:** (($932.1M + $100M) \* (1 - 0.22) / 62.1M) \* 15 = $194.5 per share, a **8.1%** increase from a $180 baseline.
