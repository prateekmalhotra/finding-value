### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Teleflex's sales growth is driven by several key product lines with large addressable markets.

In its most recent quarterly report for the period ending June 29, 2025, Teleflex highlighted a 7.2% increase in net revenues, primarily driven by volume growth in these areas. The company continues to expand into new geographies and seek expanded indications for its key products, further increasing its total addressable market.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Teleflex has a consistent record of investing in research and development to fuel its product pipeline. As stated in the 2024 10-K, the company is focused on developing new products and expanding the applications of existing ones.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Teleflex's R&D spending as a percentage of sales is in line with the medical device industry average. However, the company has a strong track record of translating R&D spending into commercially successful products. The UroLift system, a key growth driver, is a prime example of successful R&D. The company's focus on clinical data to support its products has also been effective in driving adoption. In 2024, R&D expense was approximately 7% of sales, which is a significant investment that has yielded positive results.
**Answer:** Yes

For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company's gross profit margin was 57.1% and its operating profit margin was 17.3%. While these are healthy margins, there has been some pressure on margins due to inflation and supply chain challenges. However, the company has been able to maintain strong profitability through a combination of price increases and cost-saving initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the medical device industry, a key competitive advantage is the strength of a company's relationships with physicians and hospitals.

Synthesis: Teleflex scores well on the majority of Fisher's 15 points, with the only "No" being due to a lack of specific data on labor and personnel relations. The company's strengths lie in its innovative products with long growth runways, its commitment to R&D, its strong financial position, and its experienced and transparent management team. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months would be a significant product launch that accelerates revenue growth, a major acquisition that expands the company's product portfolio, or a successful resolution of the ongoing supply chain challenges that leads to a significant improvement in profit margins. To flip the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes," the company would need to provide more transparency on key metrics such as employee turnover and engagement.

fisher score is 14 / 15
