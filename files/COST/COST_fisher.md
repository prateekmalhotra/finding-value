Company: Costco Wholesale Corporation (COST)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May 11, 2025; Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 1, 2024.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco continues to demonstrate a clear path for sustained growth through multiple channels. The company is expanding its physical footprint, with plans to open up to 29 new warehouses in fiscal 2025, adding to its base of 890 warehouses at the end of fiscal 2024. International markets and e-commerce are significant growth drivers; comparable sales for e-commerce increased 16% for the 36 weeks ended May 11, 2025, yet online sales still represent a small fraction of total revenue, indicating substantial upside potential. The warehouse club industry has consistently outgrown the broader retail market, and Costco holds a dominant market share within it.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively investing in growth initiatives beyond its core warehouse model. The company intends to spend over $5.0 billion on capital expenditures in fiscal 2025, targeting new warehouses, information systems, and distribution facilities. There is a clear focus on expanding the private-label Kirkland Signature brand, which differentiates its product mix and supports margins. The strong growth in e-commerce, supported by ongoing investment in its digital platform, demonstrates a commitment to evolving with consumer preferences and developing an omnichannel experience.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a retailer, "R&D" is best measured by investments in merchandising, supply-chain technology, and e-commerce. Costco does not report traditional R&D spending, but its investments in these areas appear effective. The sustained growth of the high-quality Kirkland Signature private label, which constitutes a third of total sales, demonstrates strong merchandising development. Furthermore, the 16% comparable sales growth in e-commerce during the first 36 weeks of fiscal 2025 points to successful investment in its digital platform. While direct R&D metrics are unavailable, these operational results indicate effective innovation relative to its retail model.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's "sales organization" is its membership-based warehouse model, which is exceptionally effective. The company achieves high sales productivity, with average sales per warehouse for locations open more than a year reaching $260 million in fiscal 2024. A critical indicator of sales success is the membership renewal rate, which was a very high 92.7% in the U.S. and Canada and 90.2% worldwide as of May 11, 2025. This demonstrates powerful customer loyalty and the success of the company's value proposition in retaining its customer base.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco operates on a low-gross-margin model by design to drive high sales volume and membership loyalty. For the quarter ended May 11, 2025, the company's gross margin was 11.25% and its operating margin was 4.0%. While these figures are low in absolute terms, they are highly effective within the company's business model. The operating margin is favorable compared to competitors like Walmart, whose net margins have been noted as lower than Costco's, and BJ's Wholesale, which reported a net margin of 2.76%. The model's success is proven by the significant profit generated from membership fees, which largely flows directly to the bottom line.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco focuses on improving margins through operational efficiency and merchandise mix. Management consistently highlights strategies like increasing the sales penetration of its higher-margin private-label Kirkland Signature brand. The company also enhances efficiency through its "no-frills, self-service warehouse facilities," volume purchasing, and an efficient distribution network that reduces merchandise handling. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, gross margin percentage increased by 41 basis points, driven by improvements in both core merchandise categories and ancillary businesses.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco has a strong, long-standing reputation for superior employee compensation and benefits relative to the retail industry, viewing it as essential for reducing turnover and increasing productivity. As of March 2025, the company raised its minimum wage to $20.00 per hour, and the average hourly rate for its U.S. and Canadian employees is over $31. However, the company faced contentious contract negotiations with the Teamsters union, representing 18,000 workers, in early 2025. While a new contract was successfully ratified, averting a strike, the friction indicates that relations are functional but not without significant challenges.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's executive team is characterized by stability and long tenure, with most officers having over 25 years of service. The recent CEO succession in early 2024 was a smooth transition, with Ron Vachris, a long-time company executive, taking the role. This demonstrates a strong internal pipeline and thoughtful succession planning. The board and executive team appear stable and aligned, with no public evidence of significant discord.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's leadership structure shows significant depth. The 2024 10-K filing lists a team of 12 senior executives beyond the CEO, covering all key operational and administrative functions. This includes separate Chief Operating Officers for the Northern, Eastern, Southwest, and International divisions, ensuring focused leadership across its vast geographic footprint. The recent seamless CEO transition, where an internal candidate was promoted, is strong evidence of a deep management bench and effective succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's accounting controls appear robust and reliable. The company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 1, 2024. The financial statements provide clear segment disclosures, and there is no history of recent material restatements. Management's discussion of results demonstrates a granular understanding of cost drivers, such as breaking out the basis-point impact of gasoline price deflation and wage increases on margins and SG&A.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Costco's membership model is a key differentiator and a powerful competitive advantage. The high-margin membership fee revenue ($4.8 billion in fiscal 2024) provides a stable profit stream that allows the company to offer goods at significantly lower gross margins than competitors. This creates a virtuous cycle: low prices drive membership growth and high renewal rates (90.5% worldwide in 2024), which in turn generates the profit to sustain the low-price strategy. The "treasure hunt" merchandising approach and the strength of the Kirkland Signature brand further lock in a loyal customer base, making its business model difficult to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management explicitly prioritizes a long-range outlook. The MD&A section of the 2024 10-K states, "We do not focus in the short-term on maximizing prices charged, but instead seek to maintain what we believe is a perception among our members of our 'pricing authority'". This philosophy demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice short-term margin for long-term member trust and loyalty. Similarly, the company's policy of paying industry-leading wages and benefits is a long-term investment in employee productivity and retention, even if it creates near-term expense headwinds.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, eliminating the need for dilutive equity financing. As of May 11, 2025, Costco had $13.8 billion in cash and cash equivalents. It generates substantial free cash flow from operations, totaling $9.5 billion in the first 36 weeks of fiscal 2025. Rather than issuing shares, Costco consistently returns capital to shareholders via dividends and a share repurchase program, under which $2.2 billion remained available as of May 11, 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company's SEC filings are detailed and transparently discuss both risks and negative factors impacting results, access to earnings call transcripts to evaluate management's direct responses to questions was not possible. For example, the Q3 2025 10-Q openly discusses how digital promotions negatively impacted membership renewal rate calculations. However, without reviewing unscripted remarks from an earnings call, a full assessment of management's candor under pressure cannot be made. Therefore, this criterion is not met with verifiable evidence.
**Answer:** No

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are reasons to question management's integrity. As disclosed in its 2024 10-K and subsequent 10-Q filings, Costco is subject to a Civil Investigative Demand from a U.S. Attorney's Office related to a False Claims Act investigation concerning prescription medications. Being under a federal investigation for potentially presenting false claims to the government is a significant red flag. While the company states it does not expect a material adverse effect, the existence of such an investigation prevents the conclusion that management has "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Costco scores highly on most of Fisher's points, reflecting a durable and well-managed business with a powerful, difficult-to-replicate competitive moat. Its strongest positives are the long runway for growth in e-commerce and international markets, an exceptionally effective sales model proven by high renewal rates, and a disciplined long-term focus on value for members. The primary negatives stem from governance and legal issues. The ongoing False Claims Act investigation is a significant concern that directly impacts the assessment of management's integrity. The score could improve over the next 12-24 months if the federal investigation is resolved favorably with no findings of wrongdoing, which would flip point 15 to "Yes". Additionally, access to and analysis of several quarters of earnings call transcripts demonstrating clear and candid discussions of challenges could change the score for point 14.

fisher score is 13 / 15
