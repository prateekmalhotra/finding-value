Autodesk, Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for FY2025 (filed May 31, 2025), Q1 FY2026 Earnings Call Transcript (May 22, 2025), and other public disclosures.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**  
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk serves large and growing markets including Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations (AECO), and Manufacturing (MFG). The company is capitalizing on the construction industry's digital transformation with its Autodesk Construction Cloud and is driving convergence between design and manufacturing with its Fusion 360 platform. In its Q1 FY26 earnings call, management noted broad-based growth in AEC and manufacturing across products and regions, indicating sustained demand. Total revenue grew 12% in fiscal 2025 to $6.13 billion, with AECO and MFG segments growing 14% and 12%, respectively.  
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk is heavily investing in its cloud platforms—Forma for AEC, Fusion for manufacturing, and Flow for M&E—to drive next-generation growth. In its Q1 FY26 earnings call, CEO Andrew Anagnost stated, "We are focusing our growth investments on our strategic priorities in cloud, platform, and AI." The company's strategy involves creating a single connected ecosystem for its applications, facilitated by Autodesk Platform Services, to support third-party development and connect customer workflows. In fiscal 2025, Autodesk also completed several strategic acquisitions, including Payapps and PIX, to enhance its construction payment and media production workflow capabilities.  
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk's R&D expense was $1.485 billion in fiscal 2025, representing approximately 24.2% of total net revenue. This level of investment is consistent with its historical spending and is high relative to many software peers. The R&D is focused on building out its industry clouds, enhancing AI capabilities, and connecting workflows. The sustained double-digit revenue growth and the successful transition to a subscription-based, cloud-centric portfolio suggest that its R&D investments are effective at delivering products that meet market demand.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk utilizes a combination of direct sales, particularly for large enterprise accounts, and a global indirect channel of distributors and resellers. The company is modernizing its sales motion by transitioning most of its indirect business to a new transaction model where it contracts directly with the end customer, designed to build more direct relationships and improve data access. As of January 31, 2025, the company's Net Revenue Retention Rate (NR3) was within the 100%-110% range, indicating solid customer retention and expansion. The consistent revenue growth and high recurring revenue (97% of total) demonstrate the sales organization's effectiveness.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal year 2025, Autodesk reported a GAAP operating margin of 22% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 36%. The company's gross profit margin was approximately 90.6% ($5.553 billion gross profit on $6.131 billion revenue), reflecting the high margins typical of a software business. These margins demonstrate strong profitability, even as the company continues to invest heavily in R&D and sales.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk is focused on driving efficiency and optimizing its go-to-market organization. In early fiscal 2026, the company initiated a restructuring plan to reallocate resources to strategic priorities like cloud and AI. The transition to a new direct-transaction model is expected to be broadly neutral to operating profit dollars but will help Autodesk gain operating leverage over time. Additionally, management has stated a focus on optimizing sales and marketing to drive higher margins.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF2rPP9lUSQRixdIMatL7MzAvnSs8nJQim9MPVGUCOJ1UtOIW8JIDnxkvyuojWq3Egr7mx_dsaf34EBKssslj2WUHUj2WwGd6BUUEcK4DoRAkkF_gVuv_2LwJdRkHo6M6-tKZ8o0Y9GrOGmisoFxcHKl4vi0doX4AdDWcg5WsEoNXFSnSO8SyYoBrCUiku-i54NKPTpFUYpaYlI45yoSFglphSfrkRrIubKfJ_sEo2qvKmfHcI= (May 22, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of January 31, 2025, Autodesk employed approximately 15,300 people and stated in its 10-K that "we believe our employee relations are strong." The company has been recognized on Glassdoor's list of Best Places to Work in 2024 and TIME's World's Best Companies in 2023, based on employee reviews. However, some employee reviews point to challenges with middle management and career growth opportunities, indicating relations are good but may not be uniformly "outstanding." Given the lack of union disputes and positive external awards, the evidence leans positive.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEzfmYLoUjWpE2ylMaN4nN4ix_8rpgc0pxH49ouf43beXT1mNULF2NqdciDAUC2ox1_1KZQp7MGXdRlKDevHHDH8cZ0how8RXN-sx4Ph_OrjcGPVzFk1UbFnKGziRWRqrejBZFn (August 22, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHppzaQoFMfzJHovP_giD4GAVzb5cA_hoYxwUcKrZigtaIuDjDUMkORczZ1YbYMG5ghM-YHDuC1r_Muk7FbMQb-rw2BSHD6v_lXyQmpEXKL3FYKfIbFHMCcklcczDJSmi65eBlCtZQDBqxq4NHL8fxD (August 22, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent internal investigation into the company's accounting practices, which concluded in May 2024, resulted in a significant management change. CFO Deborah Clifford was moved to the role of Chief Strategy Officer, and an Interim CFO was appointed. While the company stated the investigation found no need for a financial restatement, such a probe and the subsequent high-level personnel shift indicate a period of instability and scrutiny at the executive level.  
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk's executive team, detailed in its 10-K and on its website, includes leaders for its primary product groups (AECO, MFG), as well as functional leaders for technology, legal, and people. The appointment of a board member, Elizabeth "Betsy" Rafael, as Interim CFO demonstrates a bench of experienced leaders who can step into critical roles. However, the recent reshuffling in the CFO position following an internal investigation raises questions about the stability and depth in the most senior financial leadership roles.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHLaX_akcui6h54Yw25zC0-UWh9QhVNfsZQd5RA9q2T5FtwgmkAWmOqYKpcvM2n4dBVxulIZnlgwOelqs9-jyJ8VNmMuZ7rRufHOYAH0DhyJE4jPLUpQuSXT2nfO47cWIE7-dHl9VlJegI1syHp3xLrGwJ-_xtn2Ap2iyArFmxEU_NVzTtOa_f_7Q2gs4TQOkCKO_G_XibW8_vWpjwchiJSjAja_wbUKPxA11z11LHaeyQJ8vni_G4hMZxOA== (May 31, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's Audit Committee recently conducted an internal investigation into Autodesk's free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices. The investigation revealed that certain decisions about discretionary spending, collections, and accounts payable were informed by their anticipated effects on the company's external financial targets. While this did not lead to a financial restatement, the fact that an investigation into these practices was necessary indicates a significant weakness in accounting controls and cost analysis discipline. The company delayed its fiscal 2025 10-K filing as a result of the probe.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE66eCz4Sop_n1-pviAFHTQWJhD3Is297DKpjzLX7vhyKa2ZraofXBmpqN3QdoAZmajG_zxieuYdstddvct77W0Gc2KdXORJzPO2pfAwH2POEjp3IakJUQTJvJQytXGctvVIZTbNeI2zzBwTuMWHPp4IbAB3C518eVLnLwGcUWE_eidk96Tx5Pf4NfRTfeh9bWNc1OfARpFEAYzYwvW_r7rq1KxbzIlJkIDEeFc7P1bKodf24xcHls= (June 3, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk's key competitive advantage is the deep integration of its software into the workflows of the architecture, engineering, and construction industries, creating significant ecosystem lock-in. The company's subscription model, with over 97% recurring revenue, provides a stable and predictable financial foundation. Furthermore, the company's vast global network of users, third-party developers, and educational institutions creates powerful network effects that are difficult for competitors to replicate. Its flagship products, like AutoCAD and Revit, are industry standards, reinforcing its competitive moat.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes long-term strategy, focusing on the transition to its cloud platforms and new business models, even when these initiatives create short-term headwinds. The CEO's commentary in the Q1 FY26 earnings call highlighted focusing growth investments on "strategic priorities in cloud, platform, and AI" to "drive long-term shareholder value." The company's sustained high R&D spending as a percentage of revenue (over 24%) also demonstrates a willingness to invest for future growth at the expense of maximizing near-term profits.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF2rPP9lUSQRixdIMatL7MzAvnSs8nJQim9MPVGUCOJ1UtOIW8JIDnxkvyuojWq3Egr7mx_dsaf34EBKssslj2WUHUj2WwGd6BUUEcK4DoRAkkF_gVuv_2LwJdRkHo6M6-tKZ8o0Y9GrOGmisoFxcHKl4vi0doX4AdDWcg5WsEoNXFSnSO8SyYoBrCUiku-i54NKPTpFUYpaYlI45yoSFglphSfrkRrIubKfJ_sEo2qvKmfHcI= (May 22, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk has a strong financial position, generating $1.61 billion in cash flow from operations in fiscal 2025. As of January 31, 2025, the company held $2.15 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. Rather than issuing equity, Autodesk actively repurchases its own shares, buying back $858 million worth of common stock in fiscal 2025 under a Board-authorized $5 billion repurchase program. This strong cash generation and commitment to buybacks indicates a very low risk of dilutive equity financing.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's handling of the recent internal investigation raises concerns about its candor. The company announced the investigation and a delay to its 10-K filing on April 1, 2024, a month after its earnings release, stating that information was brought to management's attention *after* the February 29 release. This delay suggests a lack of proactive transparency. Following the announcement, the company entered a "closed period" and restricted communications with investors until the investigation's completion was announced on May 31, 2024, which is a form of "clamming up" during a period of trouble.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHLaX_akcui6h54Yw25zC0-UWh9QhVNfsZQd5RA9q2T5FtwgmkAWmOqYKpcvM2n4dBVxulIZnlgwOelqs9-jyJ8VNmMuZ7rRufHOYAH0DhyJE4jPLUpQuSXT2nfO47cWIE7-dHl9VlJegI1syHp3xLrGwJ-_xtn2Ap2iyArFmxEU_NVzTtOa_f_7Q2gs4TQOkCKO_G_XibW8_vWpjwchiJSjAja_wbUKPxA11z11LHaeyQJ8vni_G4hMZxOA== (May 31, 2024)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The audit committee's investigation into free cash flow and margin practices, which found that financial targets informed decisions on discretionary spending and collections, casts a serious shadow on management's integrity. While no financial restatement was required, the investigation itself and the subsequent CFO transition imply that practices were, at a minimum, questionable. This event, coupled with the ongoing SEC inquiry and shareholder lawsuits that have arisen from it, means management's integrity cannot be considered "unquestionable" at this time.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm) (May 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE66eCz4Sop_n1-pviAFHTQWJhD3Is297DKpjzLX7vhyKa2ZraofXBmpqN3QdoAZmajG_zxieuYdstddvct77W0Gc2KdXORJzPO2pfAwH2POEjp3IakJUQTJvJQytXGctvVIZTbNeI2zzBwTuMWHPp4IbAB3C518eVLnLwGcUWE_eidk96Tx5Pf4NfRTfeh9bWNc1OfARpFEAYzYwvW_r7rq1KxbzIlJkIDEeFc7P1bKodf24xcHls= (June 3, 2024)

### Synthesis
Autodesk scores positively on many of Fisher's points related to its business quality, market position, and financial strength. The company benefits from a long runway for growth in its core markets, a commitment to R&D, a highly effective and profitable subscription-based sales model, and strong competitive moats built on ecosystem lock-in. However, the analysis is overwhelmingly negated by recent governance failures. The internal investigation into accounting practices has critically damaged the scores for accounting controls, executive relations, management depth, candor, and integrity.

The most significant variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the fallout from this investigation. A clean resolution with the SEC, the successful installment of a permanent CFO who restores confidence, and a sustained period of transparent financial reporting without any control weaknesses are necessary to flip the multiple "No" answers to "Yes." Conversely, any negative findings from the SEC or further governance issues could solidify these weaknesses. Secondly, the successful adoption and scaling of its industry cloud platforms (Fusion, Forma, Flow) will be critical evidence for the continued effectiveness of its R&D and long-range strategy.

fisher score is 10 / 15
