**Company:** Armstrong World Industries, Inc. (AWI)
**Date of Analysis:** August 23, 2025
**Primary Sources Reviewed:** AWI Form 10-K (filed February 25, 2025), csmarket.com competitor analysis.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Armstrong World Industries holds a leadership position in the Americas' architectural ceilings and walls market. The company's growth strategy is twofold: strengthening its core Mineral Fiber segment, which primarily serves the large and stable renovation market, and aggressively expanding its Architectural Specialties segment through both organic growth and acquisitions. Recent acquisitions like 3form (architectural resin/glass) and Zahner (exterior metal solutions) have expanded the company into adjacent product categories, increasing its total addressable market. AWI is also capitalizing on key industry trends such as demand for improved acoustics, sustainability (Sustain® product family), and energy efficiency (Templok® products), which should provide demand tailwinds for years to come.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a clear and demonstrated commitment to developing new growth avenues. The company's strategy explicitly states a focus on "market-driven innovation and digital tools" alongside expanding its Architectural Specialties portfolio. This is evidenced by investments in developing new products like Templok® energy-saving ceiling tiles and a consistent track record of acquiring companies in new, adjacent categories. Between November 2022 and December 2024, AWI completed at least five significant acquisitions to build out its specialty products portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 Form 10-K, AWI states that product innovation is "important and necessary" but expenses these costs as incurred within Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) expenses. The specific dollar amount or percentage of sales dedicated to R&D is not disclosed, preventing a direct comparison to industry peers. While the company highlights new product families like Sustain® and Templok®, the lack of quantitative data on R&D investment and output makes it impossible to verify the effectiveness of these efforts relative to the company's size or competitors.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AWI utilizes a robust, multi-channel sales and distribution network that is a key competitive advantage. In 2024, nearly 65% of consolidated net sales were to building materials distributors, with two distributors (Foundation Building Materials, Inc. and GMS, Inc.) accounting for a combined $735.6 million in gross sales. This indicates deep, long-standing, and highly productive channel partnerships. An additional 10% of sales are through large home centers. The Architectural Specialties segment relies on direct sales to contractors, architects, and designers, and its strong growth points to an effective, specification-driven salesforce.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AWI demonstrates strong and improving profitability. For the full year 2024, the company reported a consolidated operating margin of 25.9% ($374.3 million in operating income on $1,445.7 million of net sales), an increase from 25.0% in 2023. The core Mineral Fiber segment is highly profitable, with a 32.7% operating margin in 2024. While direct competitor margin data is not readily available, one industry analysis notes AWI's net margin of 20.68% is higher than the average of its competitors, supporting the conclusion that its profitability is above-average for the sector.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)], [https://csimarket.com/stocks/compet_glance.php?code=AWI (Date of Access: August 23, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through multiple initiatives. The company successfully implemented price increases for its Mineral Fiber and WAVE grid products in 2024 and announced further increases for early 2025. Margin expansion in 2024 was driven by a favorable Average Unit Value (AUV), resulting from this like-for-like pricing and a favorable mix of higher-value products. AWI also benefited from improved manufacturing productivity and lower input costs, demonstrating a focus on operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company states in its 2024 10-K that "relations with our employees are constructive and positive." However, approximately 52% of its U.S. production workforce is unionized, and there is a history of labor friction. In 2022, the United Steelworkers (USW) publicly criticized AWI for "greed" in a trademark dispute with a spun-off company that the union claimed threatened hundreds of jobs. While historical, reports from 2011 detailed a contentious lockout of 260 union workers at a Pennsylvania plant. Given this history, there is insufficient evidence to classify the company's labor relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a consistent corporate strategy focused on core growth and expansion through acquisition. The successful execution of at least seven acquisitions since mid-2020 and their integration into the Architectural Specialties segment suggests a high degree of alignment and functional effectiveness between the senior management team and the Board of Directors. There are no public reports or disclosures that indicate any instability, infighting, or significant disagreements among senior executives or with the board.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AWI's successful execution of a complex strategy provides strong indirect evidence of management depth. The company simultaneously manages a large, mature Mineral Fiber business while executing a roll-up strategy in the diverse Architectural Specialties segment, which has involved the acquisition and integration of numerous distinct businesses. This operational complexity, spanning different materials, manufacturing processes, and sales channels, requires a skilled and deep bench of leadership below the CEO and CFO to manage effectively.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AWI's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. The company's management also certified the effectiveness of its internal controls. There were no material weaknesses identified, and the company has no recent history of financial restatements. The company also provides clear segment-level financial data, allowing for detailed analysis of revenues and operating income.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for AWI is its integrated ceiling solutions offering, bolstered by its 50% ownership of the WAVE (Worthington Armstrong Venture) joint venture. WAVE manufactures the suspension (grid) systems that are used to install AWI's ceiling tiles. This provides AWI with a secure supply chain, product compatibility, and the ability to sell a complete, branded system. This integration, combined with the industry's most recognized brand name and a dominant distribution network, creates a significant competitive moat that is difficult for rivals to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AWI's capital allocation strategy demonstrates a focus on long-range growth. The company is actively acquiring smaller, high-growth businesses in the Architectural Specialties segment, which currently have lower operating margins (12.0% in 2024) than the core Mineral Fiber segment (32.7%). This strategy dilutes the company's overall margin in the short term but builds a foundation for future growth in higher-end, specified products. This willingness to invest in acquisitions and new product development (Templok®) for future growth, rather than maximizing near-term margins, is a hallmark of a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, with robust cash flow generation. In 2024, AWI generated $266.8 million in cash from operating activities. The company funds its capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases through cash from operations and debt, with no indication of a need for dilutive equity financing. In fact, the company is actively anti-dilutive, having repurchased $55.0 million of its common stock in 2024 under a board-authorized share repurchase program.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's disclosures in its 2024 10-K exhibit a high degree of candor. In the Management's Discussion & Analysis, the company directly addressed a volume decrease in its Mineral Fiber segment, attributing it to inventory-level changes at home center customers rather than obscuring the issue. The Risk Factors section provides specific, non-generic risks, including the potential impact of sustained remote/hybrid work models on future office renovation demand, demonstrating transparency about potential headwinds.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's 2024 10-K and a search for public records revealed no evidence of fraud, corruption, or major governance scandals related to the current management team. The company's independent auditor issued a clean opinion on the financial statements and internal controls. Disclosed legal proceedings relate to legacy environmental matters common to industrial manufacturers and do not pertain to management's integrity. Searches for fraud or SEC investigations related to "Armstrong World Industries" yielded no relevant results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/7431/000095017025026060/awi-20241231.htm (February 25, 2025)]

---
**Synthesis:**
Armstrong World Industries scores well against Fisher's framework, exhibiting the hallmarks of a durable, well-managed business. The company's strongest positives are its dominant market position, strong brand and distribution network, high profitability in its core business, and a clear, well-executed strategy for long-term growth through acquisitions and innovation. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful integration of its recent, large acquisitions (Zahner and 3form) and their ability to contribute to margin expansion in the Architectural Specialties segment. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could flip to a "Yes" if the company began disclosing its R&D spending and could demonstrate a high return on that investment through new product vitality. The "No" on labor relations would require a prolonged period without public disputes and a successful, amicable renegotiation of the collective bargaining agreements expiring in 2025 to change.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
