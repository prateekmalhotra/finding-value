### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** "Back to Starbucks" Strategic Plan

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** A comprehensive plan to revitalize the brand and drive growth through enhanced customer experience, operational efficiencies, and renewed focus on the core coffeehouse concept. The plan includes the rollout of the "Green Apron Service" model to over 2,000 U.S. locations by the end of the fiscal year to improve service speed and partner engagement.
*   **Mechanism:** The plan aims to increase customer traffic and transaction volume by improving the in-store experience and streamlining operations. Successful execution could lead to higher same-store sales and improved operating margins, driving earnings growth and a higher stock valuation.
*   **Timing:** The plan was initiated in the second half of fiscal 2024 and is expected to show more significant results over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 1% increase in same-store sales, 50 bps margin improvement.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 2-3% increase in same-store sales, 100 bps margin improvement.
    *   **High Scenario:** 4-5% increase in same-store sales, 150 bps margin improvement.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-30%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. Management has expressed strong confidence in the plan, and early indicators from the Canadian market, which has returned to positive comps, are promising.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful rollout of the "Green Apron Service" model, positive customer reception to new marketing campaigns and product innovations, and stable macroeconomic conditions.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Same-store sales growth, customer traffic trends, partner turnover rates (currently at a record low), and operating margin performance.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Failure to execute the plan effectively, negative consumer response, or a downturn in the broader economy could derail the turnaround.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the key performance indicators to gauge the plan's traction before committing further capital.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has an ongoing share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors. As of September 29, 2024, 29.8 million shares were available for repurchase.
*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, all else being equal, can lead to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with the pace of repurchases at the discretion of management.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Repurchase of 5 million shares.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Repurchase of 10-15 million shares.
    *   **High Scenario:** Repurchase of 20-25 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 0-10%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. Starbucks has a consistent history of returning cash to shareholders through buybacks.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's cash flow generation, alternative uses of capital, and prevailing market conditions.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in the company's 10-Q filings.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in business performance could lead to a suspension or reduction in the buyback program.

*   **Mechanism:** New store openings contribute directly to revenue growth. As these stores mature, they are expected to improve profitability and contribute to overall earnings growth.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing over the next 12-60 months.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. "Back to Starbucks" Strategic Plan - Base Scenario**

*   **Assumptions:** 2.5% same-store sales growth, 100 bps operating margin improvement.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   FY2024 Revenue: $36.2 billion.
    *   Incremental Revenue from same-store sales growth: $36.2B \* 2.5% = $905 million.
    *   FY2024 Operating Income: $5.4 billion.
    *   Incremental Operating Income from margin improvement: $36.2B \* 1% = $362 million.
    *   **Total Incremental Operating Income:** $905M (from sales) \* 15% (margin) + $362M = $497.75 million.
*   **Valuation Impact:** Assuming a 15x P/E multiple and a 24% tax rate, the incremental value would be approximately $5.7 billion, or a ~6% increase in market capitalization. This does not account for the full potential impact of restored investor confidence.

**2. Global Store Expansion - Base Scenario**

*   **Assumptions:** 5% net new store growth, average revenue per store of $900,000, and a 15% operating margin.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Incremental Stores: 40,500 \* 5% = 2,025 stores.
    *   Incremental Revenue: 2,025 stores \* $900,000/store = $1.82 billion.
    *   Incremental Operating Income: $1.82B \* 15% = $273 million.
*   **Valuation Impact:** At a 15x P/E and 24% tax rate, this would add approximately $3.1 billion in market value, or a ~3.5% increase.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts present a mixed but cautiously optimistic picture. The "Back to Starbucks" plan has the potential to drive a meaningful recovery in same-store sales and margins, but execution is key and the results are not yet guaranteed. The share repurchase program provides a layer of support. However, the company is still facing significant headwinds, including a challenging macroeconomic environment and a 1% decline in global comparable store sales in Q2 2025. The short-term market signal is neutral to slightly positive, contingent on early signs of success from the turnaround plan.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Sustained Global Economic Downturn:** A significant recession could severely impact discretionary consumer spending, rendering the "Back to Starbucks" plan ineffective and halting store expansion.
2.  **Failure of the "Back to Starbucks" Plan:** If the new operational and marketing initiatives fail to resonate with customers, the company could see a continued decline in traffic and sales, leading to a significant drop in profitability.
3.  **Intensified Competition:** Increased competition from both specialty coffee shops and quick-service restaurants could erode Starbucks' market share and pricing power, negating the benefits of any operational improvements.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

The investment case for Starbucks hinges on the successful execution of its "Back to Starbucks" turnaround plan. The potential for a 10-30% upside is plausible if the company can restore positive same-store sales growth and improve margins. However, the risks are significant, and the most important indicator to monitor is the trend in customer traffic and transaction volume over the next two quarters.
