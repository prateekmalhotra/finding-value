### **4) Forecast & Assumptions**
*   **Forecast Horizon:** 5 years (2026-2030)
*   **Revenue Growth:** A conservative 5% annual growth is assumed, which is below the most recent TTM growth of 19.08% and provides a buffer for potential market volatility. (StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement, TTM ended June 30, 2025)
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin of 72.67% will be used and held flat, as it is in line with recent historical margins and no specific drivers for expansion were cited. (StockAnalysis.com, Income Statement, TTM ended June 30, 2025)
*   **Tax Rate:** A conservative 21% tax rate is assumed, representing the U.S. federal statutory rate.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled at 1.0% of revenue, consistent with the TTM figure of approximately 0.99% of revenue.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Due to its volatility and nature in a brokerage business, a conservative assumption of 0 is made for forecasting purposes.
    *   **D&A:** Projected at 1.6% of revenue, in line with the TTM figure of approximately 1.64% of revenue.
*   **SBC and Dilution:** Stock-Based Compensation will be treated as a real cash expense and subtracted from FCFF. The diluted share count of 439 million will be used and grown at a conservative 1% annually to account for future grants.

### **10) One-paragraph Risk Notes**
Key downside risks to this valuation include a significant downturn in global trading volumes, which would directly impact commission revenues. A sustained period of low interest rates could compress net interest margins, a primary driver of profitability. The company's reliance on proprietary technology also introduces operational risks, including system failures or cybersecurity breaches that could disrupt business and damage its reputation. Finally, increased competition from other low-cost or zero-commission brokers could pressure margins and market share.

final answer is 48.20 $
