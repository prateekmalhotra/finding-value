Upwork Inc., August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K (FY2024, filed February 13, 2025), Q2 2025 Earnings (reported August 6, 2025), and company press releases.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork operates in the global gig economy, a large and growing market. The company is expanding its reach within this market by moving beyond its core marketplace to serve larger enterprise clients. On August 19, 2025, Upwork launched "Lifted," a new subsidiary focused on providing a full suite of contingent workforce solutions for enterprises, addressing needs like talent sourcing, contracting, and management. This initiative, combined with ongoing investments in AI-powered features and a large addressable market, suggests a long runway for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork demonstrates a clear commitment to ongoing development through acquisitions and internal investment. In November 2024, Upwork acquired Objective AI for $19.1 million to bolster its AI and search capabilities. The launch of the enterprise-focused subsidiary "Lifted" in August 2025, which integrates technology from other recent acquisitions, further proves this commitment. The company's 2024 10-K also notes an 18% increase in R&D expenses, driven by investments in generative AI features.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full fiscal year 2024, Upwork's R&D expenses increased by 18%, a significant investment aimed at enhancing its platform with generative AI features and improving search functionalities. This investment appears productive, leading to tangible outcomes like the acquisition of Objective AI to accelerate its AI roadmap. The recent launch of enterprise solutions via its "Lifted" subsidiary also points to R&D efforts translating into strategic market expansion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/) (February 13, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is strategically shifting its sales focus. Sales and marketing expenses decreased by 16% in 2024 as part of a cost-saving plan, which included reduced brand marketing investment. However, the launch of "Lifted" in August 2025 signals a renewed and targeted push into the enterprise market, which requires a sophisticated sales approach. While total revenue grew 12% to $769.3 million in 2024, the reduction in sales spend suggests a focus on efficiency over aggressive expansion, making it difficult to classify the organization as "above-average" without more data on win rates or sales productivity post-reorganization.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/) (February 13, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Upwork has demonstrated strong and improving margins. The company reported a record gross margin of 77.8% for the second quarter of 2025. For the full fiscal year 2024, the gross margin was 77%, up from 75% in 2023. The company also achieved a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.3% in Q2 2025, showing significant profitability on a non-GAAP basis. This indicates a strong core business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UPWORK-INC-46786888/news/Upwork-Investor-Presentation-August-2025-46786888/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UPWORK-INC-46786888/news/Upwork-Investor-Presentation-August-2025-46786888/) (August 7, 2025), [https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/) (February 13, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through both strategic pricing and cost discipline. The Marketplace take rate increased to 18.0% in 2024 from 15.4% in 2023, driven by changes in service fees. Furthermore, in October 2024, the company initiated a restructuring plan that included a 21% workforce reduction to enhance operational efficiency. These actions directly contributed to the gross margin expansion and the swing from an operating loss in 2023 to operating income of $65.2 million in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/) (February 13, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In October 2024, Upwork announced a significant restructuring plan which involved a 21% reduction in its workforce. While described as a move to increase efficiency and innovation, such a large layoff can negatively impact morale and employee relations. There is no publicly available, verifiable evidence from filings or major news outlets to suggest the company has "outstanding" relations following this event.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/) (February 13, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is evidence of recent change at the top. On August 12, 2025, the company announced the appointment of a new Chief Operating Officer, effective September 2, 2025. While management changes are normal, a transition in a key role like COO does not, by itself, demonstrate outstanding relations. Without further evidence of long-term stability or a clear succession plan narrative from the company, this point is not met.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://stocktitan.net/news/UPWK/upwork-inc-reports-material-event-8-k-filing-reveals-coo-u3z1q8g9q8i4.html](https://stocktitan.net/news/UPWK/upwork-inc-reports-material-event-8-k-filing-reveals-coo-u3z1q8g9q8i4.html) (August 12, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations page and SEC filings list a full executive team beyond the CEO, including a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Technology Officer, and a new Chief Operating Officer joining in September 2025. The creation of the "Lifted" subsidiary to target the enterprise market also suggests a growing layer of senior leadership managing key business units. This indicates a functional management structure with specified leaders for key areas.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork's financial statements are audited by a reputable firm, and the 2024 Form 10-K, filed February 13, 2025, contains an unqualified audit opinion. The company provides segment revenue information for its Marketplace and Enterprise offerings, giving investors insight into performance drivers. There is no recent history of material weaknesses in internal controls or financial restatements, suggesting the controls are adequate and effective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1627475/000162747525000011/upwk-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1627475/000162747525000011/upwk-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a two-sided marketplace, Upwork's success hinges on network effects. The company facilitated $4.0 billion in Gross Services Volume (GSV) in 2024, indicating a very liquid and active platform. Upwork’s ability to attract and retain a large base of both skilled talent and clients is its primary competitive advantage. The scale of its GSV is a key indicator of its strength relative to smaller competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/) (February 13, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions indicate a balanced approach. The company undertook a significant restructuring in 2024 to improve near-term profitability and efficiency. Simultaneously, it is making long-term growth investments, such as the acquisition of Objective AI and the launch of the Lifted subsidiary, which are not expected to pay off immediately. This willingness to invest in new growth areas while also focusing on core profitability supports a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/](https://www.tradingview.com/news/reuters/2025-02-13:upwork-inc-sec-10-k-report/) (February 13, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork appears to be in a strong financial position to fund its growth. As of the end of Q2 2025, the company had approximately $635 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. It also generated a strong free cash flow of $65.6 million in the same quarter. This robust liquidity and internal cash generation capacity should be sufficient to fund operations and strategic investments without needing to issue dilutive equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UPWORK-INC-46786888/news/Upwork-Investor-Presentation-August-2025-46786888/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/UPWORK-INC-46786888/news/Upwork-Investor-Presentation-August-2025-46786888/) (August 7, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork holds regular quarterly earnings calls that are publicly accessible via webcast. The company provides detailed financial results and hosts a Q&A session with analysts, suggesting a commitment to transparency. For instance, in its 2024 10-K, it openly discusses risks such as macroeconomic impacts on Gross Services Volume (GSV) and competition. This open disclosure of challenges indicates a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/upwork-inc.-scheduled-to-report-q2-2025-financial-results-on-august-6-2025-2025-07](https://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/upwork-inc.-scheduled-to-report-q2-2025-financial-results-on-august-6-2025-2025-07) (July 15, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of legal proceedings in the most recent 10-K and a search for major regulatory actions or scandals do not reveal any issues that would call the integrity of the senior management team into question. The company has standard governance structures in place. There is no evidence of significant related-party transactions, audit issues, or governance red flags that would challenge this point.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1627475/000162747525000011/upwk-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1627475/000162747525000011/upwk-20241231.htm) (February 13, 2025)
---
Synthesis:
Upwork scores well on factors within its direct control: product development, margin improvement, and financial strength. The company's strong gross margins and recent move to positive operating income and free cash flow are significant positives. Its strategy to expand into the enterprise market with the "Lifted" subsidiary and invest in AI demonstrates a clear plan for future growth. The primary negatives are concentrated in personnel and sales. The large 2024 layoff and a recent COO transition create uncertainty around employee and executive relations, while a 16% cut in sales and marketing spend makes it difficult to assess the strength of its go-to-market engine. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on the execution of its enterprise strategy; strong adoption of "Lifted" would prove out its sales and R&D efforts, likely flipping the "Above-Average Sales Organization" score to a "Yes."

fisher score is 12 / 15
