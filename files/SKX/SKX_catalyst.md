*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which can increase earnings per share (EPS) and signal management's confidence in the company's future prospects, potentially leading to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** The program is active and runs through July 25, 2027. Repurchases can occur at any time within this window.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $200 million of stock in the next 12 months.

*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**

    *   Stock price levels, as repurchases are often more aggressive at lower valuations.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in business could reduce the cash available for buybacks. The company may choose to prioritize other investments, such as capital expenditures or acquisitions.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (Short)**

**1. International Growth (Base Scenario)**
*   **Assumption:** International sales grow by 15% in the next 12 months.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   International sales for the six months ended June 30, 2025: $3,135.8 million.
    *   Annualized international sales: $3,135.8 million \* 2 = $6,271.6 million.
    *   15% growth: $6,271.6 million \* 0.15 = $940.7 million in additional sales.
    *   Assuming a 10% net margin on these sales: $940.7 million \* 0.10 = $94.1 million in additional net income.
*   **Valuation Impact:** At a 15x P/E multiple, this could add approximately $1.41 billion to the market capitalization.

**2. Share Repurchase Program (Base Scenario)**
*   **Assumption:** The company repurchases $400 million of stock in the next 12 months.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Current market capitalization (approximate, for illustrative purposes): $10 billion.
    *   Number of shares (approximate): 150 million.
    *   Current stock price (approximate): $66.67.
    *   Shares repurchased: $400 million / $66.67 = 6 million shares.
    *   Reduction in shares outstanding: 6 million / 150 million = 4% reduction.
*   **Valuation Impact:** This would lead to a ~4% increase in EPS, which could translate to a similar increase in the stock price, all else being equal.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for Skechers appears positive. The ongoing share repurchase program provides a direct mechanism for returning capital to shareholders and supporting the stock price. More significantly, the strong and consistent growth in international markets, particularly in EMEA and APAC, is a powerful driver of revenue and profitability. While there are risks, the current momentum suggests a positive outlook for stock performance in the 0–12 month timeframe.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Global Economic Downturn:** A significant global recession would likely reduce consumer discretionary spending, negatively impacting sales across all regions and channels.
2.  **Supply Chain Disruptions:** As most products are manufactured in China and Vietnam, any major disruptions due to political instability, trade disputes, or other factors could severely impact the company's ability to meet demand.
3.  **Intensified Competition:** The footwear market is highly competitive. Increased competition from major players or new entrants could lead to price wars, reduced market share, and lower profitability.

Based on the analysis, Skechers presents a compelling investment case with a positive balance of near-term catalysts. The top catalyst is the strong international growth, which is expected to drive significant revenue and earnings upside. The share repurchase program provides additional support. The most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly sales growth in the EMEA and APAC regions.
