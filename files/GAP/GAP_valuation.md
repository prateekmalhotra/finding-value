*   **Cost of Equity:** 4.28% + 1.2 * 6.0% = 11.48%
*   **Cost of Debt:** 89 / 1490 = 5.97%
*   **WACC:** (11.48% * (Market Cap / (Market Cap + Debt))) + (5.97% * (1 - 0.266) * (Debt / (Market Cap + Debt))). Assuming a market cap of ~$8B based on recent stock prices, the WACC is ~10%. For conservatism, a **WACC of 10.5%** is used.

*   **Method:** Gordon Growth Model
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0% (Long-run inflation proxy).

### **10) One-paragraph Risk Notes**

Key downside risks to this valuation include the highly competitive nature of the apparel industry, which could pressure margins and growth. A failure to accurately predict and respond to changing consumer fashion trends could lead to excess inventory and markdowns. Furthermore, the company's reliance on a global supply chain exposes it to geopolitical risks and trade policy changes, such as tariffs, which could increase costs and disrupt operations.

final answer is 12.86 $
