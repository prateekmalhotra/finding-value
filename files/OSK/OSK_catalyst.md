**3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV) Production Ramp-Up
    *   **Type:** Operational
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Oshkosh Defense was selected by the USPS to build their NGDV under an indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity (IDIQ) contract that allows the USPS to purchase up to 165,000 units over ten years. The company began shipping the NGDV in April 2024 and expects to increase production throughout 2025 to reach full-rate production by the start of 2026.
    *   **Mechanism:** Increased production and delivery of the NGDV will lead to higher revenue and operating income for the Defense segment, which will in turn increase the company's overall profitability and potentially lead to a higher stock price.
    *   **Timing:** Throughout 2025, with full-rate production expected by the start of 2026.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** Slower than expected ramp-up, resulting in lower-than-expected revenue and a minimal impact on the stock price.
        *   **Base Scenario:** Production ramps up as expected, leading to a significant increase in Defense segment revenue and operating income. This could result in a 10-20% increase in the stock price.
        *   **High Scenario:** Faster-than-expected ramp-up and additional orders from the USPS could lead to a more significant increase in revenue and operating income, potentially resulting in a stock price increase of over 20%.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a firm contract with the USPS and has already begun production and delivery.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful and timely ramp-up of production, no major supply chain disruptions, and no changes to the USPS contract.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on NGDV production and delivery numbers, Defense segment revenue and operating income, and any announcements of new orders from the USPS.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Production delays, supply chain issues, or any negative changes to the USPS contract could negatively impact the catalyst.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The NGDV contract provides a clear path to significant revenue and earnings growth for the Defense segment.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program
    *   **Type:** Corporate Action
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of 12 million shares in May 2022, of which approximately 10.2 million shares remained as of December 31, 2024.
    *   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share and can lead to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
    *   **Timing:** Ongoing, with no expiration date.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases a small number of shares, resulting in a minimal impact on the stock price.
        *   **Base Scenario:** The company continues to repurchase shares at a steady pace, leading to a 5-10% increase in the stock price over the next 12 months.
        *   **High Scenario:** The company accelerates its share repurchase program, leading to a more significant reduction in outstanding shares and a potential stock price increase of over 10%.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a history of share repurchases and a significant authorization remaining.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's stock price remaining at a level that management deems attractive for repurchases, and sufficient cash flow to fund the repurchases.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on the number of shares repurchased and the remaining authorization.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive, or a downturn in the business could reduce the cash available for repurchases.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the company's share repurchase activity and consider buying on any dips in the stock price.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Increased Dividend
    *   **Type:** Corporate Action
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company announced an increase in its quarterly dividend rate of 10.9%, to $0.51 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2025. This was the company's eleventh straight year of a double-digit percentage increase to its dividend rate.
    *   **Mechanism:** A higher dividend increases the return to shareholders and can make the stock more attractive to income-oriented investors, potentially leading to a higher stock price.
    *   **Timing:** The increased dividend began in the first quarter of 2025.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Scenario:** The dividend increase has a minimal impact on the stock price, as it is already priced in.
        *   **Base Scenario:** The dividend increase attracts new income-oriented investors, leading to a 2-5% increase in the stock price.
        *   **High Scenario:** The dividend increase, combined with other positive catalysts, leads to a more significant increase in the stock price.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** 2-5%
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has already announced the dividend increase.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's continued ability to generate sufficient cash flow to support the dividend.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly dividend announcements and the company's cash flow statements.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Any unexpected negative event that impacts the company's cash flow could put the dividend at risk.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The consistent dividend growth provides a steady return to shareholders and demonstrates the company's financial strength.
