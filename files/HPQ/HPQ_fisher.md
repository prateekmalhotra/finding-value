Company: HP Inc. (HPQ)
Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: FY2024 10-K, Q1-Q2 2025 10-Q filings, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's core markets, PCs and printing, are mature and cyclical. While the company is banking on a PC refresh cycle driven by the end of Windows 10 support and the introduction of AI-powered PCs, the overall PC market is projected to have modest single-digit growth. The printing segment remains challenged, with revenue declines noted in the most recent quarterly report. While HP is investing in growth areas like gaming peripherals and conferencing solutions, these are not yet large enough to drive a sizable increase in overall sales for several years.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's management is focused on a "Future Ready" plan, which involves investment in "Hybrid Systems," "Gaming," and "Print Services". The company is heavily promoting its new line of AI PCs, developed in partnership with Microsoft, as a key driver of future sales. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Enrique Lores stated, "we are positioning the company to create long-term value" by focusing on these growth areas. These initiatives demonstrate a commitment to developing new products beyond the mature PC and printer markets.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, HP spent approximately $1.5 billion on R&D, which represents about 2.8% of its net revenue. This percentage is relatively low compared to other major tech companies, which often spend in the high single digits or double digits. While HP is launching new products like AI PCs, its R&D spending reflects a focus on incremental innovation within existing product lines rather than breakthrough technologies. The effectiveness is therefore constrained by the relatively low investment level for a company of its size.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP possesses a vast, global, and multi-channel sales network, leveraging distributors, resellers, and direct sales. The company has deep-rooted relationships in both commercial and consumer markets. The latest 10-K highlights this extensive network as a key strength. However, the sales organization is facing challenges, with overall net revenue declining year-over-year in the most recent quarter, indicating that while extensive, it is not consistently outperforming the market.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm'] (December 18, 2024), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721725000043/hpq-20250430.htm'] (May 30, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its second quarter of 2025, HP reported a GAAP gross margin of 22.1% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 8.8%. These margins are relatively thin, characteristic of the competitive and mature hardware industry. For the full fiscal year 2024, the GAAP operating margin was 7.5%. While the company is profitable, these margin levels do not suggest a significant competitive advantage or pricing power.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721725000043/hpq-20250430.htm'] (May 30, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm'] (December 18, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing margin improvement through its "Future Ready" transformation plan. This plan includes workforce reductions, portfolio optimization to focus on higher-margin products, and supply chain efficiencies. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CFO Tim Mertes highlighted progress on the plan's structural cost savings, noting they are on track to deliver an incremental $200 million in savings. This focus on cost discipline and portfolio mix is a clear effort to bolster margins.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP is in the midst of a significant restructuring plan, announced in 2022, which includes reducing its global headcount by 7,000-9,000 employees. Such large-scale layoffs can negatively impact morale and employee relations. While the company offers standard benefits and has not faced major labor disputes recently, the ongoing workforce reduction prevents a classification of its personnel relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior management team at HP, led by CEO Enrique Lores, appears stable, with key executives having been with the company for several years. The company’s latest proxy statement (DEF 14A) outlines a clear link between executive compensation and company performance, which suggests alignment with shareholder interests. There is no public evidence of significant infighting or instability at the executive level.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's management structure includes experienced presidents for its key business segments (Personal Systems and Printing), as well as leaders for various functions like strategy, operations, and technology. This divisional leadership structure suggests a good depth of management beyond the CEO and CFO. The company has a history of promoting from within, indicating a pipeline of talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/47217/000004721724000080/hpq-20241031.htm'] (December 18, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, established public company, HP has extensive and audited financial reporting. The company's 2024 10-K filing confirms that management has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2024. The auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, provided an unqualified opinion on the financial statements. There is no recent history of material weaknesses or restatements to suggest poor controls.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP's key competitive advantage in the printing segment is its "razor-and-blade" model, where printers are sold at low margins to drive high-margin sales of proprietary ink and toner supplies. This installed base provides a recurring revenue stream. However, this model is under pressure from third-party supplies manufacturers and a consumer shift towards subscription services. The company's large market share in the PC industry provides economies of scale, but the industry is highly commoditized and competitive.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's "Future Ready" plan and its emphasis on investing in growth areas like AI PCs and gaming indicate a long-range outlook. However, the company is also executing significant share buybacks and cost-cutting measures, which are often aimed at bolstering near-term EPS. This balanced approach suggests that while long-term growth is a goal, it is not pursued at the expense of short-term profitability.
**Answer:** No

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** HP generates strong free cash flow and has a consistent policy of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, not issuing new shares. As of April 30, 2025, the company had $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents. Its strong balance sheet and cash generation capabilities make it highly unlikely that it would need to issue equity to fund growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its quarterly earnings calls, management openly discusses challenges. For example, in the Q2 2025 call, they directly addressed the revenue declines in the Printing segment and the competitive pressures in the PC market. They provide detailed financial guidance and a clear narrative on both the headwinds and tailwinds affecting the business. This level of transparency suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HPQ/transcripts/'] (May 29, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent, major legal or regulatory actions against HP's senior management that would call their integrity into question. The company has a corporate code of conduct, and its financial reporting appears to be transparent and compliant with regulations. While all large corporations face some litigation, there are no widespread scandals suggesting a lack of integrity at the top.
**Answer:** Yes

**fisher score is 9 / 15**

**Synthesis:**
HP Inc. scores well on foundational aspects like management stability, financial controls, shareholder-friendly capital allocation, and transparency. However, its Fisher score is significantly hampered by its core business fundamentals. The company operates in mature, low-growth, and highly competitive markets (PCs, printers), leading to low profit margins and a lack of a compelling long-runway for sales growth. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the commercial adoption rate of its new AI PCs and the success of its "Future Ready" cost-cutting and portfolio optimization plan. A "No" on "Products/Services with Long Runway" would flip to "Yes" if the AI PC refresh cycle proves to be substantial and sustained, driving multi-year revenue growth well above current low-single-digit market forecasts. Similarly, a "No" on "Worthwhile Profit Margins" could change if the company's cost-saving measures and a shift toward higher-margin services and peripherals lead to a significant and durable expansion of operating margins into the double digits.
