Synthesis
Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. scores very well on the Fisher 15-point checklist, with the main strengths being its long growth runway, commitment to innovation, strong profit margins, and excellent management team. The company has a clear plan for continued growth, both in the U.S. and internationally. The one area of concern is labor relations, which could become a more significant issue as the company grows. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the company's international expansion, its ability to continue to innovate and stay ahead of the competition, and its ability to manage its labor relations effectively. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" on labor relations if there is a sustained period of positive employee feedback and a reduction in unionization efforts.

fisher score is 14 / 15
