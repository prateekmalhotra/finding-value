### 8) Executive Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K does not provide specific details about executive relations. However, the executive team has been stable, with the President and CEO, Badrinarayanan Kothandaraman, leading the company since 2017.

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enphase's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting. This suggests that the company has effective accounting controls in place. The company's financial statements are detailed and provide a clear breakdown of costs and revenues.

**Answer:** Yes

**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1463101/000146310125000024/enph-20241231.htm) (February 7, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enphase's key competitive advantage is its microinverter technology, which offers superior performance, reliability, and safety compared to traditional string inverters. The company's focus on a complete energy management system, including storage and EV charging, provides a strong ecosystem lock-in. Enphase's strong brand recognition and extensive installer network also serve as significant competitive advantages.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enphase is focused on long-term growth and is investing heavily in R&D and global expansion. The company's willingness to make significant investments in new products and markets, even at the expense of short-term profitability, demonstrates a long-range profit outlook. Management's commentary in earnings calls consistently emphasizes long-term strategy and market leadership over short-term gains.

**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enphase has a strong balance sheet with $1.7 billion in net working capital as of December 31, 2024. The company generated $513.7 million in cash from operations in 2024. This strong financial position, along with access to debt markets, should allow the company to fund its growth initiatives without significant equity dilution.

**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Enphase's management team holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed financial results and outlook. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed challenges such as elevated microinverter channel inventory and the impact of tariffs. This transparency, even during challenging periods, indicates a commitment to candor with investors.

**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence to suggest that Enphase's management lacks integrity. The company is subject to the scrutiny of public markets and regulators. While the company has been named in putative securities class action lawsuits, this is not uncommon for publicly traded companies and does not in itself indicate a lack of integrity. The company has stated its intention to defend these matters vigorously.

**Answer:** Yes

---
Synthesis: Enphase Energy scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in product innovation, long-term growth potential, and financial strength. The company's commitment to R&D and its expansion into new markets and product categories bode well for its future. The primary area of concern is the company's reliance on a small number of customers. A key variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the company's ability to diversify its customer base and reduce its sales concentration. A "No" on the sales organization point could be flipped to a "Yes" with evidence of a more diversified revenue stream and reduced customer concentration risk.

fisher score is 14 / 15
