### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

This growth is driven by rising health consciousness and the continued popularity of athleisure.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE's business model is centered on continuous innovation. The company's fiscal 2025 10-K emphasizes its focus on producing products that enhance athletic performance, reduce injury, and maximize comfort. This is achieved through a dedicated staff of specialists in biomechanics, chemistry, engineering, and digital technologies, who work on proprietary technologies like Nike Air, Dri-FIT, Flyknit, and ZoomX.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE does not disclose a separate figure for Research & Development, including it within "Operating overhead expense". However, the company's "Product Research, Design and Development" efforts are described as a key factor in its success. The constant introduction of new technologies and product lines, such as the Vomero 18, demonstrates a commitment to innovation. While direct R&D spending as a percentage of revenue is not available, the company's market leadership and brand strength suggest its investment in innovation is effective.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE utilizes a multi-channel sales approach, combining its NIKE Direct operations (including company-owned stores and digital platforms) with a global wholesale network. In fiscal 2025, NIKE Direct accounted for approximately 42% of total NIKE Brand revenues, showcasing a strong direct-to-consumer connection. The company's global reach, with 57% of sales coming from international markets, and its significant investments in digital platforms and retail experiences, demonstrate an above-average sales organization. The company's ability to maintain its position as the world's largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel further supports this.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018725000047/nke-20250531.htm']

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2025, NIKE's gross margin was 42.7% and its EBIT margin was 8.2%. While the gross margin is substantial, it experienced a 190 basis point decrease from the prior year due to higher discounts and inventory obsolescence reserves. The company's operating margin has historically been in the low-to-mid teens. While currently compressed, the margins are still significant for a consumer products company of its scale.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to improve profitability. These actions include reducing the supply of certain footwear products to rebalance its portfolio, repositioning its digital platform as a full-price channel, and reinvesting in wholesale distribution to clear inventory. The company also expects to benefit from lower product costs and has identified opportunities for up to $2 billion in cumulative cost savings over the next three years.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018725000047/nke-20250531.htm']

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE has established programs like the Engagement and Wellbeing (EWB) survey to track and improve worker satisfaction in its supply chain. The company's Code of Conduct and Code Leadership Standards outline requirements for suppliers regarding working conditions, compensation, and health and safety. However, the company has faced recent criticism and allegations of wage theft and refusal to pay severance in its supply chain, creating a contradictory picture. Given these unresolved issues, labor relations cannot be considered "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a stable, experienced board of directors, with an average tenure of 7.3 years. The recent appointment of Elliott Hill, a 32-year Nike veteran, as President and CEO in October 2024, signals a return to experienced internal leadership. This move suggests a cohesive vision at the executive level. The company has clear stock ownership requirements for its directors and executive officers to align their interests with shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE’s executive team comprises seasoned leaders with extensive experience within the company and the industry. The “Information about our Executive Officers” section of the FY2025 10-K details a team with deep backgrounds in key areas like product innovation, commercial operations, finance, and human resources. The recent leadership changes, which brought back several experienced executives, further underscore the company's bench strength and focus on leveraging its historical knowledge.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE's internal control over financial reporting was deemed effective as of May 31, 2025, by both management and its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, according to the FY2025 10-K. The auditor's report was unqualified, indicating that the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects. The company provides detailed segment reporting, offering transparency into revenues and EBIT for each of its geographic regions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018725000047/nke-20250531.htm']

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE's primary competitive advantage lies in its powerful brand, which is built on a long history of product innovation and extensive marketing, including high-profile athlete and team endorsements. This brand strength creates a significant moat, allowing the company to command premium pricing for its products. In the athletic apparel industry, where trends change rapidly, NIKE's ability to create and shape culture through its marketing and products is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018725000047/nke-20250531.htm']

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is currently executing a strategy that prioritizes long-term brand health and market positioning over short-term financial results. Actions such as reducing the supply of certain products, increasing markdowns to clear inventory, and boosting marketing investment have negatively impacted revenues and gross margin in the short term. However, these moves are intended to "reignite brand momentum and reposition our business to drive long-term shareholder value," indicating a clear long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018725000047/nke-20250531.htm']

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE has a strong financial position with $9.2 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments as of May 31, 2025. The company consistently generates strong operating cash flow ($3.7 billion in fiscal 2025) and has access to a $3 billion commercial paper program and committed credit facilities. Furthermore, the company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through a multi-billion dollar share repurchase program, not issuing new shares, indicating no risk of dilution from equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018725000047/nke-20250531.htm']

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its fiscal 2025 10-K, management openly discusses the challenges facing the business, including decreased traffic and the need to reduce the supply of certain products through increased markdowns, which negatively impacted revenues and gross margin. They also acknowledge external risks such as geopolitical dynamics and new tariffs. This level of transparency about both successes and challenges in official filings demonstrates a commitment to candor with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/320187/000032018725000047/nke-20250531.htm']

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While NIKE has a corporate Code of Conduct and emphasizes ethical practices, the company faces ongoing legal and ethical challenges that call its integrity into question. These include allegations of wage theft in its supply chain, a class-action lawsuit for "greenwashing," and past issues related to a toxic corporate culture. Although the company has taken steps to address these problems, the persistence of such issues prevents a conclusion of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
NIKE scores well on most of Fisher's points, demonstrating strong market potential, a deep commitment to innovation, a powerful sales organization, and a solid financial position. The management team is experienced, with a clear long-term strategy, and maintains transparent communication with investors. The primary weaknesses identified are in the areas of labor relations and overall corporate integrity, where ongoing controversies and legal challenges tarnish an otherwise strong profile. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on the success of its product portfolio reset and margin improvement initiatives. A successful execution of the new product cycle and achieving the targeted $2 billion in cost savings would solidify the "Yes" answers for points 5 and 6. Conversely, further negative developments or failure to resolve current disputes in its supply chain could reinforce the "No" on points 7 and 15 and potentially impact the company's brand image.

fisher score is 13 / 15
