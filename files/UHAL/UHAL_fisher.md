The self-storage segment, a key growth driver, added 6.5 million net rentable square feet in fiscal 2025, with occupancy rates at a healthy 91.9%. The company is also expanding its network of independent dealers, which stood at over 21,600 as of March 31, 2025, providing a capital-light way to increase market penetration.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While U-Haul does not disclose specific R&D spending, its effectiveness can be inferred from its product and service innovations. The company's in-house design and manufacturing of its rental equipment, including the "Mom's Attic" feature and "Gentle Ride Suspension," demonstrate a focus on product differentiation. The development of the "Truck Share 24/7" platform, which was developed in-house over a decade, is a significant technological achievement that enhances customer convenience and operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** U-Haul's sales organization is a key competitive advantage, characterized by its extensive network of nearly 2,400 company-owned stores and over 21,600 independent dealers. This hybrid model allows for broad market coverage and a capital-efficient expansion strategy. The company's online reservation system and the U-Haul app are significant drivers of rental transactions, providing a convenient and efficient sales channel for customers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, U-Haul reported total revenues of $5.83 billion and earnings from operations of $716.2 million, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 12.3%. While this is a respectable margin, it is a decrease from the previous year's operating margin of 17.4% ($977.8 million in operating income on $5.63 billion in revenue). The decline was primarily due to increased operating expenses and lower gains on the disposal of rental equipment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** U-Haul is taking several actions to maintain and improve profit margins. The company is focused on increasing transaction volume and improving pricing and utilization for its self-moving equipment rentals. They are also expanding their higher-margin self-storage business, which provides a more stable revenue stream. Additionally, the company's investments in technology, such as the "Truck Share 24/7" platform, are aimed at improving operational efficiency and reducing costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025), EnvZone, "Inside U-Haul's Story in Self-Move Market Dominance from Family Investment," October 18, 2020.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, U-Haul employed approximately 35,100 people in the United States and Canada. The company offers a range of benefits, including a 401(k) plan, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP), and various health and wellness programs. The company's 10-K does not mention any significant labor disputes or unionization efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Shoen family has a long history of managing U-Haul, with Edward J. Shoen serving as Chairman and CEO. The family's significant ownership stake (approximately 50.1% of voting common stock) aligns their interests with those of long-term shareholders. While this concentration of ownership could be a corporate governance concern for some investors, it also provides stability and a long-term perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information regarding the depth of management beyond the named executive officers is limited in the provided documents. The company's long history and consistent strategy suggest a stable management team, but more disclosure on succession planning and the roles of other key executives would be needed for a more thorough assessment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** U-Haul's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting. The company's segment reporting provides a good level of detail into the performance of its different business lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** U-Haul's key competitive advantage is its extensive and integrated network of company-owned stores and independent dealers, which is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's vertical integration, including the in-house manufacturing of its trucks and trailers, allows for greater control over product quality and cost. The U-Haul brand is also a significant asset, with strong name recognition in the do-it-yourself moving and storage market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025), EnvZone, "Inside U-Haul's Story in Self-Move Market Dominance from Family Investment," October 18, 2020.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** U-Haul's consistent investment in its rental fleet and self-storage properties, even during periods of economic uncertainty, suggests a long-range outlook. The company's focus on building out its digital capabilities and expanding its network of dealers and storage affiliates also points to a long-term growth strategy. Management's commentary often emphasizes the long-term value creation potential of their investments.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** U-Haul has a strong financial position, with significant cash flow from operations. The company has historically funded its growth through a combination of internally generated funds and debt financing, without resorting to significant equity issuance. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $988.8 million in cash and cash equivalents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** U-Haul's management provides regular updates to investors through quarterly earnings calls and SEC filings. The company's disclosures appear to be transparent, and management provides detailed explanations for the company's performance, both positive and negative. The company's investor relations website also provides a wealth of information for investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided documents to suggest that U-Haul's management is not of unquestionable integrity. The company has been in business for over 75 years and has a strong reputation in the market. The company's 10-K does not disclose any material legal or regulatory proceedings that would call into question the integrity of its management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/4457/000095017025078451/uhal-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025).

---
**Synthesis:**

U-Haul scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its long-term growth prospects, commitment to innovation, and dominant market position. The company's extensive network, vertical integration, and brand recognition are significant competitive advantages. The two "No" answers are related to a recent decline in profit margins and a lack of disclosure on management depth. The biggest factor that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the company's ability to improve its profit margins in the face of inflationary pressures and a potentially softening consumer environment. A "No" on profit margins could be flipped to a "Yes" with a sustained improvement in operating margins back to the levels seen in previous years. The "No" on management depth could be addressed with more detailed disclosures on succession planning and the roles of key executives beyond the named officers.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
