Pebblebrook Hotel Trust, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-Q filed May 1, 2025, investor presentations from May 2025 and July 2024, and Q1 2025 earnings call transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pebblebrook Hotel Trust has strategically shifted its portfolio towards leisure-focused resorts and away from urban, business-transient hotels. This move capitalizes on the growing trend of leisure travel. The company's May 2025 investor presentation highlights that since 2019, they have acquired 5 upper-upscale and luxury resorts for $802 million while selling 15 urban properties for $1.2 billion. This has resulted in the resort segment's contribution to EBITDA rising from 17% to 45%. The recovery of urban markets and group travel also presents a significant opportunity for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pebblebrook has demonstrated a strong commitment to reinvesting in its properties to drive growth. The company has invested over $280 million in ROI-related redevelopments and repositionings, which are expected to drive significant organic EBITDA growth. For 2025, the company plans to invest $65.0 million to $75.0 million in capital investments for renovations and repositioning projects at several properties. This ongoing capital investment program indicates a focus on maintaining and enhancing the competitiveness of its assets.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a REIT, "R&D" translates to capital allocation effectiveness. Pebblebrook's strategy of recycling capital from lower-quality urban assets into higher-growth resort properties demonstrates an effective approach to capital allocation. The company's focus on "operational and redevelopment opportunities" is a core part of its mission. The company has a demonstrated track record of repositioning assets to enhance their value and market position.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a REIT, Pebblebrook relies on its hotel operators for sales and marketing. However, the company's asset management team works closely with the operators to drive revenue. In Q1 2025, Same-Property RevPAR was flat, but Same-Property Total RevPAR increased, indicating strength in non-room revenues. The company's strategic shift to a 50/50 business/leisure customer mix and a focus on group travel has diversified its revenue base.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Q1 2025, Pebblebrook's Hotel EBITDA was $60.8 million on $319.9 million of hotel revenues, for a Hotel EBITDA margin of approximately 19.0%. While this is a key profitability metric for hotel REITs, it is important to consider the broader economic context and the ongoing recovery in the travel industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pebblebrook is focused on proactive revenue generation and expense management. The company's asset management team works with hotel operators to improve property efficiencies, lower costs, and maximize revenues. Their capital investment program is aimed at repositioning properties to better compete and command higher rates, which should support margin expansion. The company is also focused on growing its portfolio of higher-margin resort properties.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information available in the provided documents regarding Pebblebrook's labor and personnel relations, such as employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations. Without credible, recent evidence, it is not possible to assess this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's corporate profile and investor presentations show a stable and experienced executive team. Jon E. Bortz has served as Chairman, President, and CEO since the company's inception in 2009. This long tenure suggests a stable and effective leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pebblebrook's investor relations website lists a detailed executive team with significant experience in the hospitality and real estate industries. The team includes executives with backgrounds in finance, asset management, and investments, indicating a well-rounded and deep management team beyond the CEO.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pebblebrook's quarterly and annual filings are detailed and provide segment-level data, which suggests robust accounting controls. The company's 10-Q report includes a statement on the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures, signed by the CEO and CFO. There is no indication of any material weaknesses or restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pebblebrook's strategic shift to a portfolio of unique, lifestyle-oriented resorts and urban hotels provides a competitive advantage. This focus on experiential travel allows for higher pricing power and less exposure to commoditized business travel. The company's intensive asset management approach, where they work closely with operators, also differentiates them from more passive REITs.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's multi-year portfolio transformation and significant capital investments in redevelopment projects indicate a long-range outlook. Management's focus on "long-term industry-leading total returns" in its mission statement further supports this. The willingness to undertake major renovations, which can disrupt short-term results, for the sake of long-term value creation is a key indicator.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Pebblebrook has a share repurchase program in place, indicating that management believes the shares are undervalued and is committed to returning capital to shareholders. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company repurchased 1.2 million common shares for $13.3 million. The company's primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations, borrowings under its credit facilities, and proceeds from property sales, not equity issuance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1474098/000147409825000070/peb-20250331.htm) (May 1, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed investor presentations and holds regular earnings calls. The Q1 2025 10-Q acknowledges the challenges of near-term forecasting due to uncertainty around trade policy and economic conditions. The transcripts of their earnings calls show a willingness to answer a wide range of analyst questions.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no legal proceedings mentioned in the 10-Q that would suggest a lack of integrity. The company's filings appear to be transparent and straightforward. There are no red flags related to governance, related-party transactions, or accounting practices in the provided documents.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**

Pebblebrook Hotel Trust scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its primary strengths being its strategic portfolio transformation towards higher-growth leisure and resort assets, a clear commitment to reinvesting in its properties, and a stable and experienced management team. The company's long-term outlook is evident in its multi-year redevelopment projects and its focus on creating unique, high-quality assets. The main area of uncertainty is labor relations, a common challenge in the hotel industry, where information is not readily available in public filings. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of its renovation projects, leading to measurable improvements in RevPAR and margins, and the continued recovery of urban and group travel. A "No" on labor relations could be flipped to a "Yes" with disclosures on employee satisfaction, turnover rates, or industry awards for being a top employer.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
