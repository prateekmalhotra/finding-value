Herbalife Ltd. (HLF), analysis date August 22, 2025, based on a review of the company’s 2024 and 2025 SEC filings and recent earnings call transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Herbalife operates in the large and growing global health and wellness market. The company's product portfolio addresses several key market segments, including weight management, sports nutrition, and targeted nutrition. However, recent performance shows declining net sales, with a 2.7% decrease in 2023 and a 1.2% decrease in the first quarter of 2024. While the market has potential, the company's ability to capitalize on it is not clearly demonstrated, as evidenced by stagnant or declining sales in multiple regions.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management frequently discusses product innovation in its communications. The 2024 10-K mentions that new products and product reformulations are a key part of their growth strategy. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, the CEO highlighted the launch of new products and flavors as a driver for future growth. The company is also investing in technology to create a better digital experience for its distributors.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Herbalife’s R&D spending is modest. In 2023, the company spent $48.2 million on R&D, which is less than 1% of its $5.1 billion in net sales. While the company launches new products, the overall impact on sales growth has been limited in recent years. The company does not provide specific metrics on the success rate of new products.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Herbalife’s sales organization is its network of independent distributors. The company's success is heavily reliant on the ability of these distributors to sell products and recruit new members. Recent trends show a decline in the number of active sales leaders. The multi-level marketing model is also subject to regulatory scrutiny and public criticism, which can impact its effectiveness.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2023, Herbalife’s gross profit margin was 77.2%, but its operating margin was a much lower 6.6%. The high gross margin is characteristic of the industry, but the operating margin is more indicative of the company's profitability after accounting for operating expenses, including significant selling, general, and administrative costs associated with its distribution model. These margins have been declining in recent years.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has discussed several initiatives aimed at improving margins. These include price increases, cost-saving measures, and a focus on operating leverage. The 2024 10-K mentions a transformation program focused on improving efficiency. In recent earnings calls, the company has discussed efforts to manage expenses and optimize its supply chain.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLF/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLF/transcripts/)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's workforce consists of employees and independent distributors. While the 10-K does not indicate any major labor disputes with its employees, the relationship with its distributors is more complex. The MLM model has faced criticism and legal challenges regarding the classification of its distributors and their ability to earn a significant income.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced some turnover in its executive ranks in recent years. However, the current management team has been in place for a few years and appears to be stable. The 10-K provides detailed information on the executive team and their experience. There are no indications of major disputes among the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s 10-K and proxy statements list a number of experienced executives in key roles beyond the CEO, including a CFO, COO, and regional presidents. This suggests a reasonable depth of management. The company also has a board of directors with a mix of backgrounds and experiences.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the auditor's opinion in the 2024 10-K does not raise any material concerns about the company's accounting controls. The company provides detailed segment information, which allows for a reasonable level of cost analysis. There is no recent history of major restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The key distinguishing feature of Herbalife is its multi-level marketing (MLM) distribution model. While this model provides a large and motivated sales force with low fixed costs, it also faces significant challenges, including high distributor turnover and regulatory scrutiny. The company's brand is well-known, but the MLM model itself is a point of controversy and a potential liability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management often speaks about long-term growth initiatives. The company's investments in technology and its transformation program suggest a focus on the long term. However, the company also provides quarterly guidance and is subject to the short-term pressures of the market. There is a balance between long-term and short-term focus.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, the company had a significant amount of debt and a negative stockholders' equity. The company's cash flow from operations has also been declining. This financial position could make it difficult to fund growth without resorting to potentially dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** No

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management regularly holds earnings calls and provides detailed financial information. In recent calls, they have addressed the challenges facing the business, such as declining sales and distributor numbers. While the narrative is generally positive, they do not seem to hide from the key issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLF/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/HLF/transcripts/)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Herbalife has a history of regulatory scrutiny and legal challenges related to its business practices, particularly its MLM model. The company has paid significant fines to settle allegations of deceptive marketing practices. While the current management team may be working to improve the company's reputation, the legacy of these issues raises questions about the company's integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1180262/000095017025023207/hlf-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

Synthesis:
Herbalife's strengths lie in its established brand, global presence, and commitment to product development. The company has a deep management team and good accounting controls. However, it faces significant challenges, including declining sales, a controversial business model, and a weak financial position. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are a sustained turnaround in sales and distributor growth, a significant improvement in profitability, and a reduction in debt. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" on the "Long Runway" point if the company can demonstrate consistent organic growth. The "Unquestionable Integrity" point could also change if the company can avoid major legal and regulatory issues for a sustained period.
