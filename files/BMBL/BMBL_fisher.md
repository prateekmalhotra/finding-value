Bumble Inc. (BMBL), August 23, 2025, Primary Sources Reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K, 10-Q), Earnings Call Transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The online dating market is still growing, but Bumble's user growth has stalled. The company is attempting to address this by introducing new AI-powered features and focusing on user quality. However, these initiatives may negatively impact user and payer growth in the short term. Total paying users dropped to 3.8 million in the second quarter of 2025, down from 4 million in the first quarter and 4.2 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year. The company's revenue for the second quarter of 2025 was down 7.6% on a year-over-year basis.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bumble is rolling out new AI-powered features to expand trust and safety tools. While analysts believe this strategy will weigh on user and payer growth in the near term, it shows a commitment to product development.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bumble's R&D spending is not explicitly broken out in the provided search results, making a direct comparison to competitors difficult.

**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the online dating industry, brand differentiation and network effects are crucial. Bumble's "women-make-the-first-move" approach is a key differentiator. However, the recent decline in paying users suggests that this may not be enough to maintain a competitive edge.

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?

**Answer:** Yes

**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Bumble is at a pivotal point. The company is facing declining user and revenue growth, and its profitability is a major concern. Management is taking steps to address these issues by investing in new AI-powered features and focusing on user quality, which demonstrates a long-term outlook. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is uncertain and is expected to have a negative near-term impact. The ongoing investigation into securities fraud is a significant red flag that raises serious questions about the integrity of the company's management. To improve its Fisher Score, Bumble will need to demonstrate a return to user and revenue growth, achieve profitability, and resolve the securities fraud investigation.

fisher score is 4 / 15
