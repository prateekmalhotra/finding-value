### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** TSM consistently prioritizes long-term technology leadership over short-term margin optimization. Its massive and sustained capital expenditure and R&D budgets are evidence of this. For example, during the 2023 semiconductor downturn, TSM did not dramatically cut its CapEx or R&D, choosing instead to invest through the cycle to ensure it was ready for the rebound with next-generation technology. Management's public commentary consistently focuses on technology roadmaps and capacity plans that span 3-5 years into the future.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** TSM has a formidable balance sheet and strong cash flow generation. As of June 30, 2025, the company held over $55 billion in cash and marketable securities. It generated over $12 billion in free cash flow in the first half of 2025 alone, despite record-high capital expenditures. This strong internal cash generation, combined with a low debt-to-equity ratio and access to debt markets, is more than sufficient to fund its aggressive expansion plans without needing to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** TSM's management maintains a consistent and transparent communication style. During earnings calls, they address challenges directly, as seen in their open discussions about the cyclical inventory correction in 2023 and the specific timeline adjustments and skilled labor issues at the Arizona fab. They provide detailed quarterly guidance and are forthcoming about macroeconomic headwinds and demand fluctuations in various end markets. This consistency in good and bad times builds credibility.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
TSM scores exceptionally well against Fisher's checklist, reflecting its status as a dominant, high-quality technology leader. Its primary strengths lie in its unassailable technological leadership, deep and trusted customer relationships, and a robust long-term vision supported by massive, well-directed investment. The company's financial discipline is evident in its stellar profit margins and fortress balance sheet. The only significant weakness identified is in labor relations, specifically related to the cultural and operational challenges of its overseas expansions. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables: first, the successful execution and ramp-up of its Arizona and Japan fabs, which would flip the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes." Second, any sign of losing its process technology lead to competitors like Samsung or Intel on the critical 2nm or 1.6nm nodes would jeopardize nearly all other "Yes" answers, from margins to sales organization effectiveness.

fisher score is 14 / 15
