### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Verbatim extracts from the Q2 2025 earnings conference call on July 23, 2025:
*   **Full Year 2025 Revenue Growth:** "net sales to improve in the back half of the year and for the full year to grow by one to three% in constant currency."
*   **Full Year 2025 Adjusted Gross Margin:** "adjusted gross margin to be approximately 50%"
*   **Full Year 2025 Adjusted Tax Rate:** "no change in adjusted tax rate of 23 to 24% for the year"

---

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1:** 2.0% (Midpoint of 1-3% guidance). Rationale: Directly reflects management's 2025 outlook.
    *   **Years 2-5:** 2.5% annually. Rationale: A modest acceleration from the 2025 guidance, tapering towards the long-run inflation expectation, reflecting a mature industry.

*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin (EBIT):** 13.6% of revenue, held constant. Rationale: This is the TTM operating margin (stockanalysis.com, Aug 21, 2025). Management did not provide specific guidance on EBIT margin expansion initiatives, so a stable margin reflecting recent historical performance is a realistic base case.

*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 23.5% (Midpoint of 23-24% guidance). Rationale: Directly uses management's explicit guidance for the forecast period.

*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** 3.8% of Revenue. Rationale: This is the average Capex as a percentage of revenue over the last three fiscal years (2022-2024), providing a normalized rate of investment.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** 2.5% of *incremental* revenue. Rationale: Based on the historical relationship between revenue changes and working capital needs, this assumes a consistent level of efficiency.

*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** 1.5% of Revenue. Rationale: This aligns with the TTM SBC as a percentage of revenue ($80M / $5,336M).
    *   **Diluted Share Count:** 334 million shares, held constant. Rationale: Uses the latest reported TTM diluted weighted-average shares outstanding.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,443 | $5,579 | $5,718 | $5,861 | $6,008 |
| **EBIT (13.6%)** | **$740** | **$759** | **$778** | **$797** | **$817** |
| EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) | $566 | $580 | $595 | $610 | $625 |
| \+ D&A (assumed stable) | $168 | $168 | $168 | $168 | $168 |
| \- SBC (1.5% of Rev) | ($82) | ($84) | ($86) | ($88) | ($90) |
| \- Capex (3.8% of Rev) | ($207) | ($212) | ($217) | ($223) | ($228) |
| \- Chg. in WC (2.5% of Incr. Rev) | ($3) | ($3) | ($3) | ($4) | ($4) |
| **Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF)** | **$442** | **$449** | **$457** | **$463** | **$471** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** `Ke = Rf + β * ERP`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate (Rf):** 4.30%. (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. (Standard market premium for a mature market).
    *   **Beta (β):** 0.91. (GuruFocus, Aug 21, 2025). Rationale: This reflects the stock's historical volatility relative to the market. A beta less than 1 suggests slightly lower volatility than the broader market.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 0.91 * 5.0% = 8.85%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt (Kd):** 4.36%. (TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $117M / $2,682M)
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.36% * (1 - 23.5%) = 3.34%**

*   **WACC Calculation:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1-T)`
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** $5,912M (334M shares * $17.70/share as of Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $2,682M
    *   **Total Capital (V):** $8,594M
    *   **WACC = (5912/8594) * 8.85% + (2682/8594) * 3.34% = 6.09% + 1.04% = 7.13%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** `TV = (FCFF_Year5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. Rationale: This is a realistic long-term growth rate for a mature company in a stable industry, capped at the long-run inflation expectation.
    *   **Terminal Value = ($471 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0713 - 0.025) = $483 / 0.0463 = $10,432M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA =** Year 5 EBIT ($817M) + D&A ($168M) = $985M
    *   **Historical Median EV/EBITDA:** A typical range for the consumer discretionary sector is 8x-12x. Assuming a conservative 10x multiple.
    *   **Terminal Value (Multiple) = $985M * 10.0 = $9,850M**
    *   **Decision:** The Gordon Growth method and Exit Multiple method yield similar results. The Exit Multiple is slightly lower and more conservative, so we will proceed with the **$9,850M** terminal value.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** `EV = PV(FCFFs) + PV(Terminal Value)`
    *   PV of Explicit FCFFs = ($442/1.0713¹) + ($449/1.0713²) + ($457/1.0713³) + ($463/1.0713⁴) + ($471/1.0713⁵) = $413 + $391 + $370 + $351 + $333 = **$1,858M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $9,850M / (1.0713⁵) = $6,975M
    *   **Enterprise Value = $1,858M + $6,975M = $8,833M**

*   **Equity Value:** `Equity Value = EV - Net Debt`
    *   **Net Debt:** Total Debt ($2,682M) - Cash & Equivalents ($870M) = $1,812M
    *   **Equity Value = $8,833M - $1,812M = $7,021M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   `Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   **Value per Share = $7,021M / 334M = $21.02**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$21.02**. Assumes 2.0-2.5% revenue growth and stable 13.6% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **~$16.00**. Assumes 0% revenue growth, margin compression to 12.0%, and a lower exit multiple (8.5x), reflecting increased competition and poor execution on brand strategy.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **~$27.00**. Assumes 4% revenue growth from successful entertainment tie-ins, modest margin expansion to 14.5% from cost savings, and a higher exit multiple (11.5x).

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value.
    *   **MOS Price = $21.02 * (1 - 0.30) = $14.71**

### **One-Paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Evolving Consumer Preferences:** The toy industry is subject to rapid shifts in trends, including the continued rise of digital entertainment, which could reduce demand for physical toys. 2) **Retailer Dependence & Inventory Risk:** Mattel relies heavily on a few large retailers (like Walmart and Target), whose ordering patterns can create volatility, as seen in the recent quarter. Mismanagement of retail inventory can lead to markdowns and margin erosion. 3) **Entertainment Franchise Execution:** A significant part of the bull case rests on successfully translating IP like Barbie and Hot Wheels into recurring, profitable entertainment franchises; failure to create compelling content could stall growth. 4) **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As a consumer discretionary company, sales are sensitive to economic downturns that reduce household spending on non-essential goods.
