---
**Synthesis:**
Clarus Corporation is a company with a portfolio of well-regarded brands in the outdoor enthusiast market. The company has a long-term growth strategy focused on both organic growth and acquisitions. However, the company has faced a number of challenges in recent years, including declining sales and profitability. The company is taking steps to address these challenges, but its high debt level and the competitive nature of the industry present significant risks. The key variables that could change the company's score in the next 12-24 months include its ability to successfully execute its restructuring plan, improve its profitability, and reduce its debt. Evidence of a sustained turnaround in sales and profitability would be needed to flip the "No" answers to "Yes."
