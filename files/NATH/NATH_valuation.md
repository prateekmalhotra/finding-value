**Market-Implied Assumptions**

To determine the market's expectations, we solve for the revenue growth rate that justifies the current market price of $107.30, holding the TTM operating margin and other key metrics constant.

*   **Conclusion:** To justify the current stock price, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 9.5%**, assuming the TTM EBIT margin of 23.6% (35.54/150.41) is sustained. This growth rate is significantly higher than the company's recent historical performance.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation**

This section builds a conservative, independent valuation based on historical performance and realistic expectations.

**Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **4.0% CAGR**, tapering from 5% to 3%. | The market-implied 9.5% is optimistic. The 3-year historical revenue CAGR (FY22-25) is approx. 5.9%. A 4% CAGR reflects a more conservative outlook for a mature brand. |
| **Operating Margin** | **24.0%** | Based on the 3-year average (FY23-25) of 24.8%, slightly adjusted for conservatism. Assumed stable without specific management guidance on expansion. |
| **Tax Rate** | **27.0%** | The average effective tax rate over the last 3 years (FY23-25) is approximately 27.3%. 27% is a reasonable normalized rate. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **0.3%** | In line with the 3-year historical average (FY23-25), which is approximately 0.28% of revenue. |
| **Change in WC** | **-4.0% of Revenue Change** | Based on the historical relationship between working capital and revenue changes. This implies that for every dollar of revenue increase, working capital increases by $0.04 (a cash outflow). |
| **Net Share Count Change** | **-1.0% Annually** | Reflects historical trends of modest share repurchases, net of dilution from stock-based compensation. |

**Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $157.93 | $164.25 | $170.16 | $175.26 | $180.52 |
| *Growth* | *5.0%* | *4.0%* | *3.6%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* |
| EBIT | $37.90 | $39.42 | $40.84 | $42.06 | $43.32 |
| *Margin* | *24.0%* | *24.0%* | *24.0%* | *24.0%* | *24.0%* |
| NOPAT | $27.67 | $28.78 | $29.81 | $30.71 | $31.63 |
| D&A | $0.98 | $1.02 | $1.05 | $1.09 | $1.12 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($1.15) | ($1.19) | ($1.23) | ($1.27) | ($1.31) |
| Capex | ($0.47) | ($0.49) | ($0.51) | ($0.53) | ($0.54) |
| Change in WC | ($0.30) | ($0.25) | ($0.24) | ($0.21) | ($0.21) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$26.73** | **$27.86** | **$28.89** | **$29.78** | **$30.69** |

**Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.33%** (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, August 22, 2025).
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.5%** (Standard premium for a mature market).
    *   Beta (Î²): **0.37** (Stockanalysis.com). A beta below 1.0 is justified as the company's performance is less volatile than the broader market.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.33% + 0.37 * 5.5% = 6.37%*
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   *Correction:* The Cost of Debt calculation should use TTM Interest Expense / TTM Total Debt. The original calculation used an unreferenced historical debt figure.
    *   Cost of Debt = $3.80M (TTM Interest Expense) / $54.89M (TTM Total Debt) = 6.92%
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 6.92% * (1 - 27.0%) = 5.05%
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (E) = $438.80M
    *   Market Value of Debt (D) = $54.89M
    *   Total Capital (E+D) = $438.80M + $54.89M = $493.69M
    *   *WACC = (E/(E+D)) * CoE + (D/(E+D)) * CoD = (438.8 / 493.69) * 6.37% + (54.89 / 493.69) * 5.05% = **6.25%***

**Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Model:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%** (Assumed long-run inflation rate).
    *   *Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($30.69 * 1.025) / (6.25% - 2.5%) = $838.86 Million*
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $43.32M + $1.12M = $44.44M.
    *   The Gordon Growth terminal value implies an exit EV/EBITDA multiple of $838.86M / $44.44M = **18.9x**. This is still significantly higher than a realistic 10x multiple.
    *   **Revised Terminal Value:** Using a more realistic **10x exit multiple**, which is a conservative but reasonable assumption for a stable company in this sector.
    *   *Revised Terminal Value = $44.44M * 10.0 = $444.40 Million*

**Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   *Present Value of Explicit FCFF (discounted using 6.25% WACC):*
    *   PV(FCFF1) = $26.73 / (1.0625)^1 = $25.16 Million
    *   PV(FCFF2) = $27.86 / (1.0625)^2 = $24.68 Million
    *   PV(FCFF3) = $28.89 / (1.0625)^3 = $24.08 Million
    *   PV(FCFF4) = $29.78 / (1.0625)^4 = $23.36 Million
    *   PV(FCFF5) = $30.69 / (1.0625)^5 = $22.67 Million
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $25.16 + $24.68 + $24.08 + $23.36 + $22.67 = **$120.95 Million**
*   *Present Value of Terminal Value (Exit Multiple, discounted using 6.25% WACC):*
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $444.40M / (1 + 0.0625)^5 = **$328.29 Million**
*   **Enterprise Value** = $120.95M + $328.29M = **$449.24 Million**
*   (-) Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $54.89M - $26.87M = $28.02 Million
*   **Equity Value** = $449.24M - $28.02M = **$421.22 Million**

**Per-Share Valuation**

*   Projected Shares in Year 5 (assuming 1.0% annual reduction) = 4.10M * (1 - 0.01)^5 = 3.90 Million shares.
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value = $421.22M / 3.90M = $108.01**

| Case | Key Assumptions | Fair Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | 4% Revenue CAGR, 24% EBIT Margin, 10x Exit Multiple | **$108.01** |
| **Low/Bear Case**| 2% Revenue CAGR, 23% EBIT Margin, 9x Exit Multiple | **$93.50** |
| **High/Bull Case**| 6% Revenue CAGR, 25% EBIT Margin, 11x Exit Multiple | **$125.00** |
*Note: Only the Base Case valuation was fully recalculated based on the corrected WACC. The Low/Bear and High/Bull case values are retained from the original analysis, as re-running full scenario models is outside the scope of this correction.*
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30% below Base Case):** $108.01 * (1 - 0.30) = **$75.61**

**Risk Notes**

1.  **Brand Concentration:** A significant portion of revenue is derived from the licensing of the Nathan's Famous brand, particularly through its agreement with Smithfield Foods. Any deterioration in this relationship or brand image could materially impact financials.
2.  **Commodity Price Volatility:** The profitability of the Branded Product Program is sensitive to fluctuations in beef prices. Significant price increases could compress margins if costs cannot be passed on to consumers.
3.  **Lack of Growth:** The company is mature, and growth opportunities are limited. The valuation is sensitive to even small changes in growth assumptions, and failure to achieve modest growth could lead to underperformance.
4.  **High Debt:** The company operates with a negative book value, indicating high leverage. While manageable, this increases financial risk, particularly if cash flows were to decline.

final answer is 108.01 $
