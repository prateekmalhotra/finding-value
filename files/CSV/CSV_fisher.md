Company, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC Filings (10-K for FY2024, 10-Q for Q1 2025, 10-Q for Q2 2025), and an investor presentation from May 2025.

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carriage Services operates in the deathcare industry, which has a steady, predictable demand driven by mortality rates. The company's growth strategy focuses on acquiring and integrating funeral homes and cemeteries in strategic markets. The May 2025 Investor Presentation highlights a focus on an aging U.S. population as a long-term demand driver. The company's 2024 10-K notes the highly fragmented nature of the industry, offering continued opportunities for growth through acquisition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's growth is primarily driven by acquisitions rather than new product development. The 2024 10-K outlines a disciplined acquisition strategy focused on identifying and purchasing premier funeral homes and cemeteries in strategic markets. The investor presentation from May 2025 reiterates this focus, emphasizing the integration of acquired businesses into their existing portfolio. There is no significant mention of developing new products or services outside of this acquisition-based model.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Carriage Services does not have a formal research and development (R&D) department, and its financial statements do not show any R&D expenses. The company's business model is not based on technological innovation or product development but on the provision of deathcare services and the acquisition of related businesses. Therefore, this metric is not directly applicable.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000103/csv-20250630.htm (August 8, 2025)

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales are driven by its preneed sales program, which focuses on pre-arranging and pre-funding funeral and cemetery services. The 2024 10-K highlights the importance of this program for generating a predictable revenue stream. The May 2025 Investor Presentation shows a breakdown of preneed versus at-need revenue, indicating a focus on growing the preneed segment. However, there is limited publicly available data to benchmark the effectiveness of Carriage's sales organization against its direct competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the three months ended June 30, 2025, the company reported a gross profit margin of 24.3% for the Funeral Home segment and 35.6% for the Cemetery segment. The full-year 2024 10-K shows a consolidated gross margin of approximately 27.6%. These margins are generally in line with industry averages, but the company's profitability has been under pressure due to rising costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000103/csv-20250630.htm (August 8, 2025)

6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is focused on a "Good to Great" journey, which includes margin improvement initiatives. Specific actions include leveraging its scale to manage costs, a focus on high-margin preneed sales, and the integration of acquired businesses to realize synergies. The company's investor presentation highlights a disciplined capital allocation strategy, which includes debt reduction to lower interest expense and improve net margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is limited specific disclosure on labor and personnel relations in the company's SEC filings. The 2024 10-K notes the importance of its employees but does not provide metrics on turnover or engagement. Without more detailed information or third-party reports, it is not possible to definitively assess the quality of labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025)

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced some executive turnover, including the departure of its founder. However, the current management team has been in place for a few years and has articulated a clear strategic vision. The 2025 proxy statement will provide details on executive compensation and board structure, which are key indicators of executive relations. Without the most recent proxy statement, a full assessment is difficult.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations website and SEC filings list a number of key executives beyond the CEO, including a President & COO, and a CFO. This indicates a degree of management depth. However, the company is still heavily reliant on its key executives for strategic direction and execution.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed segment reporting in its 10-K and 10-Q filings, breaking down revenue and costs for its Funeral Home and Cemetery operations. The auditor's report in the 2024 10-K does not raise any concerns about the company's internal controls over financial reporting. This suggests that the company has adequate cost analysis and accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000103/csv-20250630.htm (August 8, 2025)

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the deathcare industry, a key competitive factor is the quality of the company's assets and their location. Carriage Services focuses on acquiring premier, high-quality funeral homes and cemeteries in strategic markets, which provides a competitive advantage. The company's decentralized operating model, which allows local managers to operate with a degree of autonomy, is another key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "Good to Great" journey implies a long-term focus on sustainable growth and profitability. The emphasis on acquisitions and deleveraging also suggests a long-range outlook. However, the company also provides quarterly guidance and is subject to the short-term pressures of the public markets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025)

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, the company had a significant amount of debt, with total liabilities of over $700 million. The company's growth strategy is capital intensive, and while it generates positive cash flow from operations, it may need to access the capital markets to fund large acquisitions. The company has a history of using debt to fund acquisitions, which suggests a preference for avoiding equity dilution. The company's investor presentation also highlights a commitment to reducing leverage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000103/csv-20250630.htm (August 8, 2025)

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company regularly holds earnings calls and provides detailed investor presentations. A review of recent earnings call transcripts would be necessary to fully assess management's candor. However, the level of disclosure in the company's SEC filings is generally good.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025), https://s27.q4cdn.com/848935511/files/doc_presentations/2025/May/05-22-2025/Carriage-Services-Investor-Presentation-May-2025.pdf (May 22, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000103/csv-20250630.htm (August 8, 2025)

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's legal proceedings in its 10-K does not reveal any material issues that would question the integrity of management. There have been no recent reports of significant scandals or controversies involving the company or its executives. However, without a more in-depth investigation, it is difficult to provide a definitive answer.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1016281/000101628125000045/csv-20241231.htm (February 28, 2025)

Synthesis:
Carriage Services scores positively on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its stable industry, long-range outlook, and financial controls. The company's focus on acquiring high-quality assets in a fragmented market provides a clear path for growth. However, the lack of product innovation and a clear picture of its labor and executive relations are areas of weakness. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months with a demonstrated ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and improve margins, and more transparency around its management and personnel practices. A significant acquisition or a change in the company's capital allocation strategy would be key variables to watch.

fisher score is 8 / 15
