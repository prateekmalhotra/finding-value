### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** Roku benefits from a large and growing user base, which creates a virtuous cycle: a larger audience attracts more content publishers, and a wider selection of content attracts more users. This two-sided network effect is a significant competitive advantage. The company's key metrics, such as Streaming Households and Streaming Hours, demonstrate this growth.

**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, Roku had 89.8 million Streaming Households, an increase of 12% from the 80.0 million at the end of 2023. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
*   For the three months ended March 31, 2025, Roku users streamed 35.8 billion hours, a 16% increase from the 30.8 billion hours streamed in the same period in 2024. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm, May 2, 2025)
*   As of June 30, 2024, Streaming Households reached 83.6 million, a 14% increase from 73.5 million as of June 30, 2023. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000034/roku-20240630.htm, August 2, 2024)

**Score:** 4 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** While not exceptionally high, switching costs for Roku users are tangible. Users invest time in personalizing their home screens, subscribing to services through Roku Pay, and becoming accustomed to the user interface. Content providers also face switching costs due to the resources invested in developing and maintaining their channels on the Roku platform.

**Evidence:**
*   Roku Pay simplifies the process for users to subscribe to services, creating a behavioral lock-in. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000042/roku-20240930.htm, October 31, 2024)
*   The Roku platform utilizes a proprietary scripting language, BrightScript, which requires content partners to invest in development for the platform. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000042/roku-20240930.htm, October 31, 2024)
*   The Roku Channel aggregates free and premium content, creating a centralized viewing experience that may be difficult for users to replicate on other platforms. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** Roku's Devices segment consistently operates at a negative gross margin, indicating a lack of cost advantage in hardware production. The company intentionally prices its hardware low to drive user acquisition and platform revenue. While this strategy supports other dimensions of its moat, it does not represent a cost advantage on its own.

**Evidence:**
*   For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Devices segment had a gross loss of USD 19.3 million. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000017/roku-20250331.htm, May 2, 2025)
*   For the three months ended June 30, 2024, the Devices segment had a gross loss of USD 15.2 million. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000034/roku-20240630.htm, August 2, 2024)
*   Roku's strategy is to manage the average selling prices of its streaming devices to increase Streaming Households, which can result in a trade-off between devices gross profit or loss and platform revenue growth. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 2 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** Roku has built a strong brand associated with user-friendliness and value in the streaming space. The company also holds a significant number of patents related to streaming technology. However, the brand may not command a significant price premium over competitors like Amazon Fire TV or Google Chromecast, who also offer low-priced hardware.

**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, Roku had approximately 1,500 issued patents and 600 pending applications in the United States and foreign countries. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
*   Roku is the leading TV streaming platform in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico by hours streamed, indicating strong brand recognition and consumer adoption. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** Roku has achieved extensive distribution through major retailers and partnerships with TV manufacturers for its Roku TV program. This broad retail footprint and the integration of its operating system into numerous TV brands create a significant barrier to entry for new competitors. The scale of its platform allows it to efficiently monetize its user base.

**Evidence:**
*   Roku streaming devices are sold through major retailers such as Amazon, Best Buy, Costco, Target, and Walmart. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
*   The Roku TV licensing program allows TV OEMs to license the Roku OS and leverage smart TV reference designs. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 4 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** With a large and engaged user base, Roku collects a substantial amount of data on viewing habits and preferences. This data can be used to personalize the user experience, improve content recommendations, and offer targeted advertising solutions. While this data is valuable, it may not be entirely unique, as competitors like Amazon and Google also have access to large datasets.

**Evidence:**
*   Roku's direct relationship with its users provides insights into their behavior on the platform, including content searches, app installations, and viewing patterns. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
*   The company uses first-party data to develop actionable insights and improve the viewer experience. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 3 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** Roku has successfully created a robust ecosystem around its operating system, with a wide range of third-party apps and a growing number of Roku-branded smart home devices. The Roku Channel and Roku Pay further enhance this ecosystem, increasing user engagement and creating more monetization opportunities. The platform's scale makes it an attractive partner for content providers and advertisers.

**Evidence:**
*   The Roku Channel aggregates content from various partners, including AVOD, FAST, and Premium Subscriptions, within a single app. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
*   The Roku ecosystem extends beyond streaming to include smart home devices like cameras, video doorbells, and lights. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 4 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The streaming industry is not heavily regulated in a way that creates significant barriers to entry for competitors. While Roku must comply with various consumer protection and data privacy laws, these regulations apply broadly to the industry and do not provide Roku with a distinct advantage.

**Evidence:**
*   The TV streaming industry is subject to evolving laws and regulations related to data privacy, consumer protection, and intellectual property, which can increase compliance costs. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 1 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** Roku's business model is not capital-intensive in the traditional sense, as it outsources manufacturing. However, the company invests significantly in research and development and content acquisition. While these investments are substantial, they are not as prohibitive as the capital expenditures required in industries like manufacturing or telecommunications.

**Evidence:**
*   Roku outsources the manufacturing of its products, which reduces capital expenditures on physical plants and equipment. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
*   The company makes significant investments in content assets, with content amortization costs of USD 206.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)

**Score:** 2 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** A significant portion of Roku's platform revenue is recurring, coming from advertising and subscriptions. This provides a degree of revenue visibility. However, advertising budgets can fluctuate with macroeconomic conditions, and content distribution agreements are subject to renegotiation, which can impact revenue streams.

**Evidence:**
*   Platform revenue, which is largely recurring, accounted for 86% of total net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
*   Agreements with content partners generally have terms of one to three years and are subject to renegotiation. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000042/roku-20240930.htm, October 31, 2024)

**Score:** 3 / 5

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (4 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 0.72 + 0.45 + 0.30 + 0.36 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.32 + 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.06 = **3.05**

Final weighted numeric score: **30.5 / 100**

### Mapping
A weighted score of 30.5 falls within the 30 <= Weighted < 50 range, which maps to a final moat rating of 2.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration of 8–12 years is based on the strength of Roku's network effects and distribution channels, which are difficult for new entrants to replicate. However, the competitive landscape is dynamic, with large, well-capitalized companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple posing a constant threat. The moat's durability is also dependent on Roku's ability to maintain its technological edge and adapt to evolving consumer preferences.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Increased Competition from Tech Giants:** Amazon, Google, or Apple could more aggressively leverage their vast resources to subsidize their streaming hardware, outbid Roku for content, or integrate their streaming platforms more deeply into their respective ecosystems, eroding Roku's user base and market share. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
2.  **Consolidation of Content Providers:** Further consolidation among media companies could give content providers greater leverage in negotiations with Roku, potentially leading to less favorable revenue-sharing agreements or the withholding of content from the Roku platform. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843925000013/roku-20241231.htm, February 14, 2025)
3.  **Shift in Consumer Behavior:** A significant shift in consumer preference towards streaming on mobile devices or through gaming consoles could reduce the importance of TV-centric platforms like Roku, diminishing its value proposition for users, advertisers, and content partners. (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1428439/000142843924000042/roku-20240930.htm, October 31, 2024)

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Streaming Households:** A sustained slowdown or decline in growth could indicate a weakening of network effects.
*   **Streaming Hours:** A decrease in engagement could signal a loss of user interest or a shift to competing platforms.
*   **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):** A decline in ARPU could indicate a weakening of Roku's ability to monetize its user base.
*   **Platform Gross Margin:** A compression in platform gross margin could signal increased competition or less favorable terms with content partners.
*   **Devices Gross Margin:** While strategically negative, a significant further decline could indicate unsustainable pricing pressure.
*   **Market Share of TV Operating Systems:** A loss of market share to competing operating systems would be a direct threat to Roku's moat.
*   **The Roku Channel Engagement:** A decline in the popularity of The Roku Channel could reduce a key source of ad inventory and user engagement.
*   **Content Partner Renewals:** The loss of a major content partner could significantly impact the platform's appeal.

### Short Verdict
Roku has established a solid competitive position in the TV streaming market, primarily through its strong network effects and extensive distribution channels. The company's large and growing user base makes it an attractive platform for content providers, which in turn draws more users to the platform. However, the company faces intense competition from some of the world's largest and most well-capitalized technology companies, and its lack of a cost advantage in hardware makes it vulnerable to pricing pressure. A change in the competitive landscape or a shift in consumer behavior could erode Roku's moat over time.
