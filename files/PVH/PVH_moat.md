| **Total** | **100%** | | **12.2** |

**1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** As a traditional apparel company, PVH does not benefit from network effects. The value of its products does not increase with the number of users.
**Evidence:**
*   There is no evidence of network effects in the company's SEC filings or earnings call transcripts.
**Score:** 0 / 5.

**2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** PVH's customers, both wholesale and retail, face no significant switching costs. Consumers can easily switch to competitor brands, and wholesale customers are not locked into long-term contracts.
**Evidence:**
*   The company does not have long-term agreements with any of its large wholesale customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** PVH has an extensive global supply chain, which may provide some economies of scale. However, the company is also subject to significant pricing pressure and cost volatility, which limits its cost advantage. Gross margin has been improving but is still susceptible to promotional activity and input cost fluctuations.
**Evidence:**
*   Gross margin for Q1 2025 was 58.6%, a decrease of 280 basis points compared to the prior year, with about 50 basis points of the decline attributed to license transitions and the remainder to promotional activity and higher freight costs. (PVH Corp. Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, June 5, 2025).
*   The company's products were produced in approximately 1,000 factories in over 30 countries during 2024, all operated by independent manufacturers. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** PVH's primary intangible assets are its globally recognized brands, *Tommy Hilfiger* and *Calvin Klein*. These brands command significant consumer awareness and allow for a global presence. This is the company's strongest moat source.
**Evidence:**
*   The company owns the *TOMMY HILFIGER* and *Calvin Klein* trademarks, which are registered for use in each of the primary countries where its products are sold. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
*   Global retail sales of products sold under the *TOMMY HILFIGER* and *Calvin Klein* brands were each approximately $9 billion in 2024. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5.

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** PVH has a global distribution network that includes wholesale, retail, and digital channels. This scale provides some advantage, but the company is also reliant on a small number of large wholesale customers, which poses a risk.
**Evidence:**
*   Sales to the company's five largest customers were 15.1% of revenue in 2024. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
*   The company operated approximately 1,400 retail locations and 1,500 shop-in-shop/concession locations worldwide as of February 2, 2025. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
*   The company's main warehousing and distribution facilities are located in the United States, the Netherlands, Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and Australia. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

**6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** PVH is investing in data and analytics to better understand consumer behavior, but there is no evidence of a proprietary dataset that provides a significant competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The PVH+ Plan includes developing a demand- and data-driven operating model by connecting the planning, buying and selling of inventory closer to demand. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** PVH does not have a business model that benefits from ecosystem or platform effects.
**Evidence:**
*   There is no evidence of an ecosystem or platform in the company's SEC filings or earnings call transcripts.
**Score:** 0 / 5.

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** PVH does not operate in an industry with significant regulatory or legal barriers to entry.
**Evidence:**
*   There is no evidence of significant regulatory or legal barriers in the company's SEC filings or earnings call transcripts.
**Score:** 0 / 5.

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The apparel industry requires capital for inventory and store build-outs, but these assets are not highly specialized. PVH's capital expenditures are a relatively small percentage of revenue.
**Evidence:**
*   Capital expenditures were $159 million in 2024, or approximately 1.8% of revenue. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** PVH's revenue is not based on long-term contracts. Wholesale orders are placed on an order-by-order basis, and retail sales are transactional.
**Evidence:**
*   The company does not have long-term agreements with any of its large wholesale customers and purchases generally occur on an order-by-order basis. (PVH Corp. Form 10-K, February 2, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

**Aggregation:**
Weighted score = (0 * 0.18) + (0 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (0 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (0 * 0.02) = 12.2 / 100

**Mapping:**
A weighted score of 12.2 falls within the 10-30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1. However, given the strength of the company's brands, I will make a conservative upward adjustment to a score of 2.

**Moat Duration Justification:**
The company's moat is primarily derived from its strong brands, which have been established over many decades. The durability of this moat is dependent on the continued relevance of the *Tommy Hilfiger* and *Calvin Klein* brands. Given the competitive nature of the fashion industry, a 5-7 year duration is a conservative estimate.

**Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios:**
1.  **Brand Relevance Declines:** A failure to anticipate and adapt to changing consumer tastes could lead to a decline in brand relevance and pricing power.
2.  **Increased Competition:** The apparel industry has low barriers to entry, and increased competition from fast-fashion and direct-to-consumer brands could erode market share.
3.  **Supply Chain Disruptions:** The company's reliance on a global supply chain makes it vulnerable to disruptions that could impact product availability and costs.

**KPIs to Monitor:**
*   Gross margin trends
*   Revenue growth by brand and region
*   Inventory levels and turns
*   Marketing spend as a percentage of sales
*   Direct-to-consumer vs. wholesale revenue mix
*   Customer engagement metrics (social media mentions, etc.)
*   Market share data

**Short Verdict Paragraph:**
PVH's moat is narrow and primarily derived from its well-established brands, *Tommy Hilfiger* and *Calvin Klein*. While these brands provide some pricing power and global recognition, the company operates in a highly competitive and cyclical industry with low switching costs and no network effects. The company's reliance on wholesale channels and its vulnerability to fashion trends are key risks. A significant and sustained decline in brand relevance would be the primary evidence that would flip this rating.

moat rating is 2 / 5
