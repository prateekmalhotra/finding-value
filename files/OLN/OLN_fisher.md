Olin Corporation, August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin operates in three segments: Chlor Alkali Products and Vinyls, Epoxy, and Winchester. The Chlor Alkali segment, producing chlorine and caustic soda, serves diverse and fundamental industries like water treatment, pulp & paper, and chemical manufacturing. While subject to economic cycles, the essential nature of these products provides a stable demand base. The Epoxy segment serves markets like wind energy and electrical laminates, which are poised for growth, but is currently facing significant pricing pressure from Asian exports. The Winchester segment is a leading U.S. ammunition producer, with stable demand from commercial, law enforcement, and military customers, including a key long-term contract to operate the Lake City Army Ammunition Plant. While the chemicals businesses are mature and cyclical, the Winchester segment and specific applications within the Epoxy segment offer moderate growth potential.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's management is focused on optimizing its existing asset base rather than large-scale development of new product lines. Capital expenditures in 2024 were $195.1 million, and the forecast for 2025 is in the $225 million to $250 million range, primarily for maintaining current facilities. The company has engaged in strategic joint ventures, such as with Plug Power to produce hydrogen, indicating an interest in leveraging its existing co-products. However, the primary strategic focus, as articulated in earnings calls, is on maximizing the value of the Electrochemical Unit (ECU) through a "value-first operating model," which prioritizes margin over volume, not necessarily on developing new growth engines.
**Answer:** No

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's research and development expenditures are modest for its size. In 2024, the company spent $18.4 million on company-sponsored research, which represents approximately 0.28% of its $6.54 billion in sales. By comparison, competitors like Dow Chemical and Huntsman Corporation typically spend a significantly higher percentage of their revenue on R&D. While Olin's Winchester segment has received industry awards for new products, the overall R&D spending level suggests that the company is not a leader in innovation within the chemical industry but rather a disciplined operator of established processes.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company markets most of its products through a direct sales force to a diverse range of industrial customers, distributors, and government entities. Management's "value-first" strategy, which prioritizes ECU margins over sales volume, indicates a highly disciplined sales approach focused on profitability rather than just market share. The Blue Water Alliance joint venture with Mitsui & Co. was established to enhance the global marketing and logistics of its caustic soda and EDC products, effectively expanding its sales reach and capabilities. This evidence suggests a sophisticated and effective sales and marketing strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/) (July 29, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's profit margins are highly cyclical. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross margin of 11.3% and an operating margin of 4.5%. These margins are down significantly from the 23.3% gross margin and 19.0% operating margin achieved in the cyclical peak of 2022, reflecting the challenging conditions in the chemical markets. While the company is a low-cost producer, its profitability is subject to significant swings based on global supply and demand dynamics for its commodity products, and current margins are compressed.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's core strategy is centered on improving profit margins. Management is executing a "value-first operating model" where it actively manages production rates to match demand and prioritizes higher-margin sales over volume. The company is also undertaking significant restructuring actions, such as reconfiguring its global Epoxy asset footprint and closing older, less efficient chlor alkali capacity to optimize its cost structure. These actions demonstrate a clear and determined effort to protect and enhance profitability even in a difficult market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Olin had 7,676 employees. In the U.S., 37% of the workforce is represented by unions. The company has two U.S. labor agreements expiring in 2025, representing approximately 2% of its global workforce. The 10-K describes various human capital initiatives under a "Lifting People" framework, focused on engagement, development, and a pay-for-performance culture. There is no evidence of recent significant labor disputes or work stoppages in the reviewed documents. This suggests stable and professionally managed labor relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no indication of instability or contentious relations among the senior management team or the Board of Directors in the reviewed filings. The executive team's compensation is aligned with performance, and the company has a clear governance structure. Management's consistent messaging across earnings calls suggests a unified strategic direction. The evidence points to a stable and functional executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/) (July 29, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's public filings list executive officers beyond the CEO, including leaders for each of the three business segments and key corporate functions. The company describes its talent management strategy, including a focus on leadership development programs and succession planning to build a pipeline of talent. The business segments are large and complex, suggesting the necessity of capable and experienced leadership at the divisional level. This structure indicates a professional approach to management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin provides detailed segment reporting, which offers visibility into the cost structures of its different businesses. The company's 2024 Form 10-K includes a report from management assessing its internal control over financial reporting as effective. The independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the chlor-alkali industry, scale and access to low-cost inputs are critical competitive advantages. Olin is the world's largest producer of chlor-alkali products. Its vertical integration into key raw materials like salt and its co-located production facilities provide a significant cost advantage. The company's "value-first" model, where it curtails production to support pricing and margins across the industry, is a unique strategy that leverages its scale to act as a market leader, distinguishing it from competitors who may prioritize volume.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions indicate a focus on long-term value creation. The decision to temporarily idle capacity and forgo lower-margin sales in its chemical businesses demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice short-term sales volumes for the sake of long-term pricing stability and profitability. Restructuring programs, such as closing older plants, incur short-term costs but are aimed at improving the long-term cost position and profitability of the asset base. These strategic choices prioritize the long-range health of the business over maximizing immediate results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/) (July 29, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Olin's financial position appears strong enough to fund its operations and strategic initiatives without dilutive equity financing. The company generated $503.2 million in cash from operating activities in 2024. More importantly, management has a strong commitment to returning capital to shareholders and reducing the share count. In 2024, Olin repurchased $300.3 million of its common stock and has a total of $2.0 billion authorized for repurchase as of December 31, 2024. This demonstrates a clear policy of using cash flow to reduce, not increase, the share count.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent earnings call transcripts indicates that management is candid about the challenges facing the business. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, executives openly discussed the "challenging industry conditions," weak demand, and negative pricing impacts from imports in the Epoxy segment. They also provided a frank outlook, expecting operating results to be lower in the near term. This level of transparency, particularly during a cyclical downturn, suggests a high degree of candor with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OLN/transcripts/2025/2/) (July 29, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K outlines a Code of Conduct and Principles of Corporate Governance that apply to all employees and directors. The independent auditor, KPMG LLP, has provided an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and internal controls. A search of public records and news archives does not reveal any significant legal or regulatory actions that would call into question the integrity of the senior management team. There are no apparent red flags related to governance or related-party transactions in the primary financial filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/74303/000007430325000023/oln-20241231.htm) (February 20, 2025)

---
**Synthesis**
Olin Corporation scores well on qualitative factors such as management strategy, discipline, and integrity. The company's strengths lie in its dominant market position in chlor-alkali products, its clear and disciplined "value-first" operating model, and its commitment to shareholder returns through buybacks. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses in its growth potential and current financial performance. The core chemical businesses are in mature, cyclical markets and are currently experiencing a significant downturn, leading to poor profit margins and a lack of a clear long-runway for sales growth. The company's R&D efforts are minimal, reinforcing its identity as a process operator rather than an innovator.

The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the cyclical recovery of the chlor-alkali and epoxy markets. A significant upturn in global industrial demand would directly improve pricing and profit margins, which could flip the "No" answers on points #1 (Long Runway) and #5 (Worthwhile Profit Margins) to "Yes". Specific evidence for this would be a sustained increase in the Electrochemical Unit (ECU) margin, which management discusses in its earnings calls, and a return of the company's overall operating margin to double-digit levels. Conversely, a prolonged global recession would cement the current low scores for these financial metrics.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
