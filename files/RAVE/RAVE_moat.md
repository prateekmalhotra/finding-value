### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
RAVE operates a traditional restaurant franchise model which does not benefit from network effects. The value of a Pizza Inn or Pie Five restaurant to a customer does not increase as more customers use the service. There is no evidence of a user base that creates compounding value or cross-side network measurements. The business is a classic linear model of selling food, not a platform.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The business model is described as franchising and licensing pizza restaurants under the "Pizza Inn" and "Pie Five" trademarks, with revenue derived from royalties, franchise fees, and supplier incentives. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   The company does not report metrics like daily/monthly active users (DAU/MAU) or viral coefficients, as these are not relevant to its business model. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Customer switching costs are virtually non-existent in the highly competitive fast-casual and pizza restaurant industry. For franchisees, there are contractual switching costs in the form of initial franchise fees and multi-year agreements, but these are standard for the industry and do not represent a unique competitive advantage. The recent decline in Pie Five units and closures of Pizza Inn locations suggest that franchisee switching costs (or the costs of failure) are not a strong enough deterrent to prevent churn.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The Pie Five domestic unit count decreased by a net of seven units in fiscal 2024, with seven closures. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   Franchise license fee agreements typically range from five to 20 years, creating a contractual lock-in for the franchisee. (Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025)
*   The restaurant industry is described as "intensely competitive with respect to price, service, location, and food quality," indicating low barriers for customers to switch. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
There is no evidence to suggest RAVE possesses a sustainable cost advantage. While the company leverages volume purchasing for its franchisees, this is a standard practice for franchise systems and does not imply a cost structure meaningfully lower than its much larger competitors. The company does not own proprietary manufacturing processes or have exclusive access to low-cost inputs.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company states it leverages "volume purchasing of food, equipment, and supplies for the franchisees' and licensees' benefit," which is a typical franchisor service, not a unique cost advantage. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   The company notes it competes with "many well-established competitors with substantially greater brand recognition and financial and other resources," implying larger competitors likely have greater or equivalent scale advantages. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   No claims or metrics regarding a gross margin differential versus peers or lower per-unit costs are present in the filings. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
RAVE's primary intangible assets are its trademarks for "Pizza Inn" and "Pie Five," which have value but do not confer significant pricing power in a crowded market. The Pizza Inn brand has a long history, but the company's small scale and declining unit count for Pie Five indicate limited brand strength. There is no mention of patents or exclusive agreements that would provide a durable competitive advantage.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company owns registered trademarks for "Pizza Inn" and "Pie Five," which are essential to the business but whose duration is subject to continued use and renewal. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   As of June 30, 2024, the company had only 126 franchised Pizza Inn restaurants and 20 franchised Pie Five units, indicating a small brand footprint compared to national chains. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   The company acknowledges it competes against rivals with "substantially greater brand recognition." (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
RAVE's distribution network is small and lacks the density to create significant barriers to entry or efficient scale. While there is a concentration of Pizza Inn units in a few southern states, this regional density is not substantial enough to deter larger, well-capitalized competitors from entering or operating profitably. The company relies on third-party distributors, a standard industry practice that does not confer a unique advantage.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   As of June 30, 2024, Pizza Inn's domestic presence was concentrated, with Texas, North Carolina, Arkansas, and Mississippi accounting for approximately 23%, 16%, 14%, and 10% of domestic units, respectively. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   The company's distribution is facilitated through "agreements with third party distributors," which is not a proprietary or advantageous network. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   The total system-wide restaurant count is small (149 total units as of June 30, 2024), limiting the potential for scale efficiencies in distribution or marketing. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The company's filings contain no evidence of a proprietary data advantage. There is no mention of unique, hard-to-replicate datasets, data-driven feedback loops improving the product, or any other data-related assets that would provide a competitive edge. The business operates as a traditional restaurant franchisor, not a data-driven technology company.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The 10-K and 10-Q filings do not mention any significant investments in or assets related to data analytics, artificial intelligence, or large-scale customer datasets. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024; Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
RAVE's business model does not include an ecosystem or platform component. It does not have a marketplace for complementary products, third-party developer integrations, or other platform characteristics. The business is a straightforward franchisor-franchisee relationship.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's business is described as franchising and licensing restaurants, with no mention of third-party developer platforms or ecosystem services. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The restaurant and franchise industries are subject to standard regulations (health, safety, FTC disclosure), but these apply to all competitors and do not create barriers to entry that protect RAVE. The company holds no special licenses, permits, or government-granted monopolies that would deter competition.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company is subject to FTC regulations for franchising and various federal, state, and local laws (health, safety, sanitation), which are standard for the industry. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   There is no mention of unique regulatory approvals or legal barriers that would provide a competitive advantage. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The capital required to open a single pizza restaurant is material for a small franchisee but does not represent a significant barrier to entry for the industry as a whole, especially for well-capitalized competitors. RAVE itself operates an asset-light model with only 21 full-time employees and leases its corporate office. The assets (restaurant equipment, leases) are not highly specific and can be repurposed or sold, reducing the sunk costs required to compete.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company operates a franchise model, meaning the bulk of the capital for restaurant build-outs is provided by franchisees. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   As of June 30, 2024, the company had only 21 full-time employees, highlighting its asset-light operational structure. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
*   Total net property and equipment on the balance sheet was only USD 0.182 million as of June 30, 2024. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
As a franchisor, RAVE has a degree of revenue visibility from its franchise agreements, which stipulate ongoing royalty payments based on a percentage of sales. These contracts typically last 5-20 years. However, this visibility is highly dependent on the success and survival of its franchisees, and the declining unit count of the Pie Five brand demonstrates the risk to this revenue stream.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Franchise royalties, based on a percentage of franchise restaurant sales, are a primary source of revenue, providing a recurring stream contingent on franchisee sales. (Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025)
*   Franchise license fee agreements typically have terms ranging from five to twenty years. (Form 10-Q, May 8, 2025)
*   The net decrease in Pie Five units and closures of international Pizza Inn locations highlight the risk that contractually obligated revenues can be terminated or default. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### Aggregation
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.15) + (1 * 0.12) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (0 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.15 + 0.15 + 0.12 + 0.10 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0.04 + 0.04 = 0.60
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 6.0 / 100

### Mapping
*   A weighted score of 6.0 is less than 10.
*   **Final Moat Rating:** 0 / 5

### Moat Duration Justification
The company has no discernible competitive advantage, resulting in an estimated moat duration of 0 years. The business is highly vulnerable to competition from larger, better-capitalized, and more well-known restaurant chains. Franchise agreements, the only source of potential durability, are not sufficient to maintain a competitive edge, as evidenced by unit closures. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Accelerated Franchisee Failures:** A downturn in consumer discretionary spending or rising input costs could pressure franchisee profitability, leading to accelerated store closures for both Pizza Inn and Pie Five, further eroding royalty streams and brand presence. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
2.  **Increased Competition from Major Chains:** Large national pizza chains (e.g., Domino's, Pizza Hut) could use their superior scale, marketing budgets, and brand recognition to take market share in RAVE's core southern US markets, making it difficult for RAVE franchisees to compete. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)
3.  **Failure to Innovate:** The fast-casual market is dynamic; if the Pizza Inn buffet concept falls further out of favor or the Pie Five brand fails to differentiate itself, the company could see a continued decline in customer traffic and franchisee interest. (Form 10-K, Sep 26, 2024)

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Domestic & International Unit Count (by brand):** A continued net decline indicates erosion of the franchise system.
2.  **Comparable Store Retail Sales:** Negative growth signals declining brand health and pricing power.
3.  **Franchise Royalty Revenue:** A decrease in this key revenue line points directly to system-wide weakness.
4.  **Number of Franchisee Defaults/Closures:** An increase is a direct measure of the inability to retain franchisees.
5.  **New Franchise Openings:** A lack of new openings indicates low demand for the company's franchise concepts.
6.  **Franchise Expenses as a % of Franchise Revenue:** An increasing percentage could signal inefficiency or the need for higher support costs for struggling franchisees.
7.  **General and Administrative Expenses:** Increases in G&A without corresponding revenue growth could pressure profitability.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Rave Restaurant Group exhibits no sustainable competitive advantage, resulting in a moat rating of 0. The company operates in the intensely competitive restaurant industry against peers with far greater scale, brand recognition, and financial resources. Its primary assets, the Pizza Inn and Pie Five brands, lack pricing power, and its franchise-based business model, while asset-light, does not create meaningful barriers to entry or high switching costs. The ongoing decline in the Pie Five unit count and the small overall system size underscore its precarious competitive position. A significant, sustained increase in unit growth and comparable store sales would be required to reconsider this rating.

moat rating is 0 / 5
