**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo is a global leader in beverage alcohol, operating in over 180 countries with a portfolio of over 200 brands, including iconic names like Johnnie Walker and Guinness. The company is strategically positioned in the premium and above spirits segment, which is growing globally and gaining share of the total beverage alcohol market.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo consistently innovates within its existing brands and expands its portfolio through strategic acquisitions. An example of this is the successful launch of Crown Royal Blackberry. The company also evolves its portfolio to align with changing consumer preferences, such as acquiring premium brands like Casamigos and Aviation Gin. In June 2025, Diageo swapped its majority ownership in Cîroc in North America for an interest in Lobos 1707 Tequila globally, indicating a strategic shift towards the high-growth tequila category. This demonstrates a commitment to actively managing its brand portfolio for future growth.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a consumer products company, Diageo's R&D is deeply integrated with its marketing and innovation functions rather than being a standalone, heavily-funded department. The company's public statements emphasize investment in "research and development of new products" as a key activity. The effectiveness of this is demonstrated by its output, such as successful brand extensions and new-to-world products that capture emerging consumer trends. However, specific R&D expenditure figures as a percentage of revenue are not disclosed, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. The focus is on brand building and marketing, where Diageo consistently invests to maintain high brand equity.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo's sales and distribution network is a key competitive advantage, with its products sold in nearly 180 countries. The company's ability to maintain or grow market share in 65% of its measured markets in fiscal 2025, including the highly competitive US market, demonstrates the strength of its sales and distribution network. The company has a diversified footprint across multiple geographies, which provides resilience against volatility in any single market.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2025, Diageo reported an adjusted operating profit margin of 28.2%. While this represented a decline of 68 basis points from the prior year, it remains a strong figure for the consumer staples sector, reflecting the company's premium product mix and strong brand portfolio. The reported operating margin of 21.4% was significantly impacted by exceptional impairment and restructuring costs.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo is actively focused on productivity to support margins. The company has a cost savings program with a target of approximately $625 million, an increase from the previous target of $500 million. In its preliminary results for fiscal 2025, the company noted a slight expansion in gross margin, which was offset by investments in overheads. Management is embedding a more performance-driven culture focused on continuous improvement and has introduced a new strategy and operating model in Europe to drive efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo states that its "Spirit of Progress" ESG action plan includes a priority to "champion inclusion and diversity." The company's materials emphasize a commitment to its people and values. However, readily available, recent, and specific quantitative data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or union relations is not provided in the initial financial filings. Without more concrete evidence, it is difficult to assess if relations are "outstanding" according to Fisher's high standard.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced a significant leadership transition. Following the passing of long-time CEO Sir Ivan Menezes in June 2023, Debra Crew took over as Chief Executive. More recently, the Chief Financial Officer, Lavanya Chandrashekar, stepped down, and Nik Jhangiani was appointed as her successor. While leadership changes are a normal part of business, the turnover in two key C-suite positions in a relatively short period introduces uncertainty.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo's leadership structure includes an Executive Committee with clear regional and functional responsibilities, suggesting a good depth of management beyond the CEO. For example, the company has presidents for its key regions (North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, etc.). This structure ensures experienced leadership is in place to manage the company's diverse global operations. The company also hosted an investor event in May 2025 featuring members of the Executive Committee and other leaders, showcasing its broader leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo provides detailed financial reporting, with breakdowns of net sales by region and product category. The company's preliminary results for fiscal 2025 were audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, who issued an unqualified opinion. There is no evidence of recent financial restatements or material weaknesses in internal controls. The company's ability to provide specific figures on the financial impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions, and disposals suggests robust accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the spirits industry, brand equity and distribution are paramount. Diageo's portfolio of "super premium" brands with long histories, such as Johnnie Walker and Guinness, provides a significant competitive advantage that is difficult to replicate. The company's global distribution network and expertise in marketing these brands give it a scale advantage over smaller competitors. The ability to gain or hold market share in the majority of its markets is a strong indicator of its outstanding position.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in the 2025 preliminary results emphasizes a focus on sharpening the company's strategy to accelerate growth and embedding a performance-driven culture. The company's continued investment in marketing and innovation, even during a challenging year, suggests a long-term view. The "Spirit of Progress" ESG plan, which addresses long-term environmental and social risks and opportunities, further supports this.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Diageo had net debt of $21.9 billion and a leverage ratio of 3.4x net debt to adjusted EBITDA. The company generated $4.3 billion in net cash flow from operating activities and $2.7 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2025. Diageo has a consistent history of returning capital to shareholders via dividends, with a recommended full-year dividend of 103.48 cents for fiscal 2025. The company's strong cash flow and access to debt markets (as evidenced by the annual renewal of its European debt issuance programme) make it highly unlikely to resort to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the fiscal 2025 preliminary results announcement, the interim CEO acknowledged it was a "challenging year" and that while there were areas of progress, "there is clearly much more to do across our broader portfolio and brands." This demonstrates a willingness to openly discuss challenges. The company regularly hosts investor events and provides detailed financial reporting and presentations, indicating a commitment to transparent communication.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo is a global company subject to a high level of scrutiny from regulators and the public. The company emphasizes "Doing business the right way" as a core principle that "underpins everything we do." A review of recent press releases and financial reports does not reveal any major legal or regulatory issues that would call the integrity of the senior management team into question. The company has a global responsible drinking resource, DRINKiQ.com, which promotes best practices.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Diageo scores well on many of Fisher's points, reflecting its status as a high-quality, blue-chip company. Its primary strengths lie in its portfolio of iconic brands, its extensive global distribution network, and its strong financial discipline, which generates significant cash flow and allows for consistent shareholder returns. The company is also making clear efforts to improve margins through productivity programs. The primary areas of concern, leading to "No" answers, are centered on human capital: a lack of specific, quantitative data to verify "outstanding" labor relations and recent turnover in the critical CEO and CFO positions. The score could be most influenced in the next 12-24 months by the performance and stability of the new executive team, a sustained recovery in organic growth and margins, and the successful integration of portfolio changes like the move towards tequila. A "No" on executive relations could flip to "Yes" with a period of stable leadership and clear strategic execution, while the labor relations point would require more transparent ESG reporting with specific metrics.

fisher score is 12 / 15
