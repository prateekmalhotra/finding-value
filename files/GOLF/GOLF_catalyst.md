### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a share repurchase program authorized by the Board of Directors for up to $1.25 billion of its common stock. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $415.5 million remaining under the current share repurchase authorization.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price, all else being equal. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with a significant portion expected to be executed over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** 25% of the remaining authorization ($103.9 million) is used, repurchasing approximately 1.5 million shares (at current prices), resulting in a ~2.5% reduction in shares outstanding.
    *   **Base Case:** 50% of the remaining authorization ($207.8 million) is used, repurchasing approximately 3.0 million shares, resulting in a ~5% reduction in shares outstanding.
    *   **High Case:** 75% of the remaining authorization ($311.6 million) is used, repurchasing approximately 4.5 million shares, resulting in a ~7.5% reduction in shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small to Medium (5-15%). The impact depends on the pace of execution and the prevailing market conditions.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has been actively repurchasing shares.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a favorable stock price.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in the 10-Q and 10-K.
    *   Cash from operations on the statement of cash flows.
    *   Announcements of any new or expanded repurchase authorizations.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business could reduce cash available for repurchases.
    *   Management may prioritize debt repayment or acquisitions over share repurchases.
    *   Large-scale insider selling may offset the positive impact of repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases relative to insider selling.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Strong Performance of New Product Launches in Titleist Golf Equipment

*   **Type:** Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has recently launched new products in its Titleist golf equipment segment, including the Pro V1 and Pro V1x golf balls, GT drivers and fairways, and SM10 wedges. These new products have been a key driver of recent sales growth.
*   **Mechanism:** Successful new product launches lead to increased sales volumes and potentially higher average selling prices, boosting revenue and profitability. This can lead to upward revisions in earnings estimates and a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** 0-12 months. The impact of these new products will be seen in the upcoming quarterly results.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** 2% constant currency growth in Titleist golf equipment sales.
    *   **Base Case:** 4% constant currency growth in Titleist golf equipment sales, in line with recent performance.
    *   **High Case:** 6% constant currency growth in Titleist golf equipment sales, driven by strong market acceptance.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small to Medium (5-15%).
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a strong track record of successful product launches.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Positive reception from consumers and professional golfers, effective marketing, and a stable golf market.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly sales growth in the Titleist golf equipment segment.
    *   Gross margins for the segment.
    *   Market share data from third-party sources.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Competitors' new products may be more successful.
    *   A decline in rounds of golf played due to economic or weather conditions.
    *   Supply chain disruptions affecting product availability.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor sales and margin trends in the Titleist segment.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Significant Insider and 10% Owner Selling

*   **Type:** Anti-Catalyst
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** There have been substantial sales of GOLF stock by insiders and the company's largest shareholder, Misto Holdings Corp. (a subsidiary of Fila Holdings Corp.). Misto Holdings has sold over $125 million worth of stock in two transactions in 2025.
*   **Mechanism:** Large-scale selling by insiders and major shareholders can signal a lack of confidence in the company's future prospects, leading to negative investor sentiment and a lower stock price. It also increases the supply of shares on the market, which can put downward pressure on the price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing.
*   **Quantification:** The total value of sales by Misto Holdings in 2025 is over $125 million. Other insiders have also sold significant amounts.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (-10% to -20%).
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 100%. The sales have already occurred.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** N/A
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   SEC Form 4 filings from insiders.
    *   Schedule 13D/G filings from Misto Holdings/Fila Holdings.
    *   Changes in institutional ownership.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** N/A
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Hedge. The consistent selling pressure from the largest shareholder is a significant headwind.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Supply Chain Optimization and Margin Expansion

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is undergoing a multi-year implementation of a new global cloud-based ERP platform and has shifted its FootJoy footwear production from a joint venture in China to a third-party facility in Vietnam. These initiatives are aimed at improving efficiency and supply chain resilience.
*   **Mechanism:** A more efficient supply chain and ERP system can lead to lower operating costs, improved inventory management, and higher gross and operating margins over the long term. This would result in higher earnings and a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** 12-36 months. The ERP implementation is expected to continue in phases over the next three years.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** 25 basis point improvement in operating margin.
    *   **Base Case:** 50 basis point improvement in operating margin.
    *   **High Case:** 75 basis point improvement in operating margin.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%).
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful implementation of the new ERP system without major disruptions.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Gross and operating margins.
    *   Inventory turnover.
    *   Updates on the ERP implementation in quarterly reports.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The ERP implementation could face delays or cost overruns.
    *   The new manufacturing setup in Vietnam may not deliver the expected cost savings or quality.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program**

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Shares Outstanding: 58.8 million (as of May 1, 2025)
    *   Current Stock Price: ~$65
    *   Base Case Repurchase: $207.8 million
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Shares Repurchased: $207.8 million / $65 = ~3.2 million shares
    *   New Shares Outstanding: 58.8 million - 3.2 million = 55.6 million
    *   % Reduction in Shares: 3.2 million / 58.8 million = 5.4%
*   **Valuation Impact:** A 5.4% reduction in shares outstanding would lead to a ~5.4% increase in EPS, which could translate to a similar increase in the stock price, all else being equal.

**2. Strong Performance of New Product Launches**

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   2024 Titleist Golf Equipment Sales: $1,507.8 million
    *   Base Case Growth: 4%
    *   Operating Margin: 18.2% (calculated from segment operating income and net sales for 2024)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Incremental Revenue: $1,507.8 million \* 4% = $60.3 million
    *   Incremental Operating Income: $60.3 million \* 18.2% = $11.0 million
*   **Valuation Impact:** An additional $11.0 million in operating income, at a 15x multiple, would add ~$165 million to the company's enterprise value, or ~$2.80 per share, representing a ~4.3% increase in the stock price.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Acushnet present a mixed picture. On the positive side, the ongoing share repurchase program and the strong performance of new product launches in the key Titleist segment provide clear drivers for potential upside. However, these are significantly counterbalanced by the persistent and large-scale selling from the company's largest shareholder, Misto Holdings, as well as other insiders. This heavy selling pressure is likely to act as a significant headwind, capping the potential upside from the positive catalysts. Therefore, the net catalyst balance for the next 0-12 months appears to be neutral to slightly negative.

### **9) Evidence Matrix**

| Citation | Claim/Field Supported |
| :--- | :--- |
| | All financial data for Q1 2025, share repurchase details, shares outstanding. |
| | All financial data for FY 2024, details on product launches, supply chain initiatives, and the share repurchase program authorization. |
| | General sentiment and management commentary on business trends. |
| | Insider and 10% owner selling activity. |

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Accelerated Selling by Misto Holdings:** If the company's largest shareholder decides to liquidate its position more aggressively, it could create significant downward pressure on the stock price, overwhelming any positive catalysts.
2.  **Economic Downturn:** A recession could lead to a significant reduction in consumer discretionary spending on golf, impacting rounds played and equipment sales, which would hurt the company's financial performance.
3.  **Major Product Recall or Failure:** A significant quality issue with a key product like the Pro V1 golf ball could severely damage the company's brand reputation and lead to a sharp decline in sales.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Acushnet Holdings Corp. presents a challenging investment case in the near term. While the company's strong brand, successful product launches, and shareholder-friendly capital return program are attractive, they are overshadowed by the significant and ongoing selling pressure from its largest shareholder. The expected upside from the share repurchase program and new product performance, in the range of 5-15%, may be fully offset by this selling. The most important indicator to monitor is the Form 4 and Schedule 13D/G filings from Misto Holdings and other insiders to gauge any change in their selling activity.
