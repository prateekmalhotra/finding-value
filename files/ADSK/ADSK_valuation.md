### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Verbatim extracts from the first-quarter fiscal 2026 earnings report on May 22, 2025:
*   **FY26 Revenue Guidance:** "The revenue guidance range increases to $6.925 billion to $6.995 billion."
*   **FY26 Non-GAAP Operating Margin:** "The company expects non-GAAP operating margin to be between 36.5% and 37% for the full year."
*   **FY26 Free Cash Flow:** "The free cash flow guidance range increases to $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion."

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1 (FY26):** **9.7%**, the midpoint of management's guidance ($6,960M). (Q1 FY26 Report, May 22, 2025)
    *   **Years 2-5:** Growth is projected to decelerate modestly from the guided rate, reflecting a blend of strong market position and the law of large numbers. Assumed rates are **9.0% (Y2), 8.5% (Y3), 8.0% (Y4), and 7.5% (Y5).**
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT):**
    *   The TTM EBIT margin is **22.75%**. This will be held constant through the forecast period. While management guides for a higher non-GAAP margin, this analysis uses the GAAP-based EBIT margin and explicitly subtracts SBC, making this a more conservative and realistic assumption. (Calculation based on TTM financials)
*   **Tax Rate:**
    *   The forecast uses an effective tax rate of **23.0%**, slightly above the TTM rate of 22.7% to be conservative. (Based on TTM Effective Tax Rate)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **D&A:** 7.2% of Revenue, based on the TTM average.
    *   **SBC:** 12.0% of Revenue, based on the TTM average.
    *   **Capex:** 0.65% of Revenue, based on the TTM average.
    *   **Change in NWC:** Modeled at 5.0% of incremental revenue, a normalized assumption for a growing software business.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,960 | $7,586 | $8,231 | $8,889 | $9,556 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *9.7%* | *9.0%* | *8.5%* | *8.0%* | *7.5%* |
| EBIT (22.75% of Rev) | $1,583 | $1,726 | $1,872 | $2,022 | $2,174 |
| EBIT \* (1-Tax Rate) | $1,219 | $1,329 | $1,442 | $1,557 | $1,674 |
| \+ D&A (7.2% of Rev) | $501 | $546 | $593 | $640 | $688 |
| \- SBC (12.0% of Rev) | ($835) | ($910) | ($988) | ($1,067) | ($1,147) |
| \- Capex (0.65% of Rev) | ($45) | ($49) | ($54) | ($58) | ($62) |
| \- Change in NWC | ($31) | ($31) | ($32) | ($33) | ($33) |
| **FCFF** | **$809** | **$885** | **$961** | **$1,039** | **$1,120** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.29%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.0%** (Standard market assumption)
    *   Beta: **1.47** (5-Year Monthly Beta for ADSK, reflecting higher volatility than the market)
    *   *Formula: Ke = Rf + Beta \* (ERP)*
    *   *Calculation: 4.29% + 1.47 \* 5.0% = **11.64%***
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-Tax Cost of Debt: **2.71%** (Interest Expense / Total Debt)
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt: *2.71% \* (1 - 23.0%) = **2.09%***
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: **$62,653M** (217M shares \* $288.63/share)
    *   Market Value of Debt: **$2,544M**
    *   *Formula: WACC = (E/(E+D) \* Ke) + (D/(E+D) \* Kd \* (1-t))*
    *   *Calculation: (96.1% \* 11.64%) + (3.9% \* 2.09%) = **11.25%***

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%** (Assumed long-run inflation rate)
    *   *Formula: TV = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)*
    *   *Calculation: ($1,120 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1125 - 0.025) = **$13,114M***
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   The 5-year median EV/EBITDA multiple for Autodesk is approximately 44x-48x, which is exceptionally high. A more conservative exit multiple of **25.0x** is used for this cross-check.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $2,174M + $688M = $2,862M
    *   *Calculation: 25.0 \* $2,862M = **$71,550M***
    *   **Judgement:** There is a significant discrepancy. The Gordon Growth method provides a far more conservative and grounded terminal value. The lower value of **$13,114M** is used for the valuation.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Present Value of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   *Calculation: $809/(1.1125)^1 + $885/(1.1125)^2 + ... + $1120/(1.1125)^5 = **$3,623M***
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:**
    *   *Calculation: $13,114M / (1.1125)^5 = **$7,698M***
*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   *Formula: EV = PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value*
    *   *Calculation: $3,623M + $7,698M = **$11,321M***
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $2,544M - $1,816M = **$728M** (Balance Sheet, May 22, 2025)
    *   *Formula: Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
    *   *Calculation: $11,321M - $728M = **$10,593M***

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Formula: Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding*
    *   *Calculation: $10,593M / 217.0M = **$48.82***
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $48.82** (As calculated above).
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$35** (Assumes lower growth, ~6-7%, and EBIT margin compression to 20%, resulting in a lower FCFF profile).
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$65** (Assumes higher growth, ~11-12%, sustained near guidance, and modest EBIT margin expansion to 24%, boosting FCFF and terminal value).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount is applied to the base-case estimate for a margin of safety.
    *   *Formula: Base-Case Value \* (1 - 0.30)*
    *   *Calculation: $48.82 \* 0.70 = **$34.17***

### **One-Paragraph Risk Notes**

Key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Competition:** The AEC and manufacturing software markets are highly competitive, and failure to innovate in areas like AI and cloud could erode market share. 2) **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** Autodesk's revenue is closely tied to the cyclical construction and manufacturing industries, which are sensitive to interest rates and economic slowdowns. 3) **Valuation Assumptions:** The valuation is highly sensitive to the terminal growth rate and WACC. A higher discount rate or lower long-term growth would significantly reduce the intrinsic value. 4) **Business Model Transition:** The ongoing shift to a subscription/consumption model introduces execution risk and could lead to revenue volatility. 5) **High Stock-Based Compensation:** High levels of SBC relative to cash flow dilute existing shareholders and represent a significant economic cost not always reflected in non-GAAP metrics.

final answer is 48.82 $
