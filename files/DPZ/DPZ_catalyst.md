### Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Domino's has an active share repurchase program with $764.3 million remaining under authorization as of March 23, 2025. The company repurchased $50.0 million of its common stock in the first quarter of 2025.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with potential for acceleration depending on market conditions and cash flow generation.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** $200 million repurchased over the next 12 months.

*   **Mechanism:** Increased customer acquisition and order frequency through the loyalty program and the Uber Eats channel will lead to higher U.S. same-store sales, which in turn boosts high-margin franchise royalty revenues.

*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** The Uber Eats partnership could prove to be less accretive than anticipated or could cannibalize existing sales channels.

### Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal

The near-term catalysts for Domino's are moderately positive. The execution of the share repurchase program provides a steady tailwind, while the U.S. same-store sales initiatives have the potential to drive meaningful upside if they continue to gain traction. The primary risk is that the Uber Eats partnership fails to deliver incremental growth. Overall, the short-term market signal is positive, with the potential for upside surprises from the U.S. business.

### Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts

1.  **A sharp and sustained increase in food commodity prices, particularly cheese, that cannot be passed on to consumers.**
2.  **A significant data breach or other cybersecurity incident that damages the company's brand and reputation.**
3.  **A material deterioration in the relationship with U.S. franchisees, leading to operational disruptions and litigation.**

### Final Recommendation Paragraph

Based on this analysis, Domino's Pizza, Inc. presents a compelling investment case with a moderately positive near-term outlook. The top catalyst is the continued momentum in U.S. same-store sales, driven by the revamped loyalty program and the Uber Eats partnership, which could lead to a 5-15% upside in the share price. The most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly U.S. same-store sales growth figure, which will provide the clearest evidence of whether these initiatives are delivering sustainable growth.
