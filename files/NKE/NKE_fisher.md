**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE consistently emphasizes its product research, design, and development efforts as key factors in its success. The company utilizes a staff of specialists in biomechanics, chemistry, exercise physiology, and engineering, complemented by advisory boards of athletes, coaches, and medical experts. While the 10-K does not break out R&D spending as a distinct line item (it's included in Operating Overhead), the constant proliferation of new technologies and product lines (e.g., ZoomX, Air Max, React) demonstrates a commitment to innovation. The success of these platforms, which command premium prices, indicates effective R&D that translates to commercial success.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE employs a multi-channel sales strategy, selling through wholesale accounts and its NIKE Direct operations, which include owned retail stores and digital platforms.

The company sells products in nearly all countries, supported by eight significant distribution centers in the U.S. and 68 outside the U.S. This global reach and sophisticated distribution network, combined with strong digital sales, indicate a highly effective and above-average sales organization.

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For fiscal year 2024, NIKE's gross margin was 44.6%, an increase of 110 basis points from the prior year. Its EBIT margin was 12.7%. These margins are substantial for a global consumer products company facing intense competition. The company's ability to maintain and slightly improve its gross margin in a volatile economic environment with inflationary pressures demonstrates strong brand power and operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2024, NIKE's gross margin increased primarily due to strategic pricing actions and lower ocean freight and logistics costs. The company is also implementing a multi-year enterprise initiative announced in December 2023 aimed at delivering cost savings by simplifying product assortment, increasing automation, and streamlining the organization. These actions demonstrate a clear focus on improving profitability through both pricing power and cost management.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE's 10-K report for fiscal 2024 states that the company has never experienced a material interruption of operations due to labor disagreements. The company emphasizes its focus on attracting, developing, and retaining a diverse and engaged workforce, guided by its core values ("Maxims") and Code of Conduct. It provides competitive pay and benefits, career development opportunities, and various well-being initiatives. While most U.S. employees are not unionized, the company works with unions and works councils in international locations as required by local law.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and deep experience within the company and industry. Mark Parker, the Executive Chairman, has been with NIKE since 1979 and served as CEO from 2006 to 2020. John Donahoe II, the current President and CEO, joined the board in 2014 before becoming CEO in 2020. Many other top executives, such as Heidi O'Neill (President, Consumer, Product & Brand) and Monique Matheson (Chief Human Resources Officer), have been with the company for over two decades, indicating long-term stability and a cohesive management team.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE's leadership structure demonstrates significant depth. The company is organized with distinct leaders for key functions and geographies, such as a President for Geographies & Marketplace (Craig Williams) and a President for Consumer, Product & Brand (Heidi O'Neill), in addition to the CEO and CFO. Many executives have long tenures and have held various senior roles within the company, suggesting a strong pipeline of internal talent and succession planning. For example, Heidi O'Neill has led NIKE's Direct to Consumer business, its marketplace, and its Women's business during her tenure.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The auditor's report from PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024, provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Management's report also concluded that internal controls were effective. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking down revenues by geography, product line (Footwear, Apparel, Equipment), and sales channel (Wholesale, Direct), indicating robust internal accounting and cost analysis capabilities.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator in the athletic apparel industry is brand strength and consumer connection, driven by marketing and athlete endorsements. NIKE's brand is one of the most valuable in the world, built on decades of high-profile endorsements with influential athletes (Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, etc.), which establishes product authenticity and drives consumer demand. The company's digital ecosystem, including the SNKRS app and other fitness apps, creates direct consumer relationships and brand loyalty that are difficult for competitors to replicate. These intangible assets provide a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy is to achieve "sustainable profitable long-term revenue growth." The company continues to make significant investments in its NIKE Direct operations, a global Enterprise Resource Planning Platform, and data and analytics to build a foundation for future scale. Furthermore, the announcement in late 2023 of a multi-year enterprise initiative to streamline the organization and reinvest savings into future growth demonstrates a long-range focus, even with the associated short-term restructuring costs ($443 million in FY2024).
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE's financial position is very strong. As of May 31, 2024, the company had $9.86 billion in cash and equivalents and $1.72 billion in short-term investments. It generated $7.4 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2024. Rather than issuing shares, the company consistently returns capital to shareholders; in fiscal 2024, it returned $6.4 billion through share repurchases and dividends under an $18 billion repurchase program authorized in June 2022. This demonstrates ample capacity to fund growth without dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Review of recent earnings call transcripts indicates management addresses challenges directly. For example, in the Q4 2024 earnings call, management openly discussed declines in NIKE Brand Digital sales, attributing them to reduced digital traffic and actions taken to reduce the supply of certain footwear products. The company provides detailed breakdowns of performance by geography, channel, and product category, and discusses specific headwinds like unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates and cost inflation, suggesting a high degree of transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** NIKE's 10-K discloses an ongoing investigation by the European Commission since January 2019 regarding tax rulings in the Netherlands, which creates a potential risk. However, the company states its belief that the investigation is without merit. There are no other major legal proceedings, governance red flags, or related-party transactions disclosed in the "Legal Proceedings" or "Risk Factors" sections of the latest 10-K that would suggest a lack of integrity at the senior management level. The company has a formal code of conduct and an ethics and compliance program. Given the single, contested tax investigation, integrity appears high but not entirely "unquestionable" under a strict interpretation.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**

NIKE scores very highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its status as a mature, market-leading company with strong brand equity, consistent innovation, and robust financials. The company's primary strengths lie in its dominant market position within a growing industry, a powerful and well-managed sales and distribution network, and a long-term strategic focus on innovation and direct-to-consumer relationships. Its financial health is excellent, with strong margins and cash flow that allow for significant shareholder returns without compromising investment in future growth. The only "No" comes from a strict interpretation of "unquestionable integrity" due to an outstanding European Commission tax investigation, though the company disputes this. The variables most likely to change this score in the next 12-24 months hinge on the success of its current product lifecycle management—successfully scaling new innovations while managing the decline of older franchises—and the execution of its enterprise-wide cost-saving and streamlining initiative. A successful resolution of the EU tax investigation would flip the final point to "Yes".

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
