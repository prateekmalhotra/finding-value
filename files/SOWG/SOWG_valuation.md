### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

No quantitative guidance was provided in the latest earnings call. Management commentary focused on recent challenges and strategic realignment.

*   **On Performance:** "Revenue in 2025 was $1.9 million compared to $15.6 million for the same period in 2024. The decline reflects softer demand driven primarily by increased competitive pressure with the arrival of large market entrants." (Q2 2025 Transcript, Aug 14, 2025)
*   **On Strategy:** "Put simply, last year, we built ahead of demand and have been scaling back strategically, streamlining storage, optimizing our supply chain, and adopting a more efficient demand-driven growth model." (Q2 2025 Transcript, Aug 14, 2025)
*   **On Outlook:** "Demand momentum is returning... With those orders now fulfilled, we expect the impact to normalize as operations realign in Q3." (Q2 2025 Transcript, Aug 14, 2025)

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | Y1: 8%, Y2: 20%, Y3: 15%, Y4: 10%, Y5: 5% | No management guidance. Y1 reflects a modest recovery from the TTM base, acknowledging competitive pressure but also management's commentary on returning demand. Growth then tapers as the business matures. |
| **Operating Margin** | Starts at -10%, improves 200bps/year to -2% | TTM margin is deeply negative. Assumption is based on management's focus on efficiency, projecting a gradual path toward profitability but not achieving it within the 5-year forecast horizon. |
| **Tax Rate** | 0% | The company is projected to have operating losses throughout the forecast period; NOLs will shield future income. |
| **Capex % of Revenue** | 15.0% | In line with the average of the last two full fiscal years (2023-2024), excluding an outlier in 2022. Reflects ongoing investment needs. |
| **SBC % of Revenue** | 15.0% | Aligned with the full-year 2024 percentage (4.81M SBC / 31.99M Rev) which is more representative than the TTM figure skewed by low revenue. |
| **Change in WC % of Î” Revenue** | 10.0% | Based on historical averages for growth companies, assuming working capital needs will correlate with revenue changes. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $10.01 | $12.01 | $13.82 | $15.20 | $15.96 |

| (-) SBC | ($1.50) | ($1.80) | ($2.07) | ($2.28) | ($2.39) |
| (-) Capex | ($1.50) | ($1.80) | ($2.07) | ($2.28) | ($2.39) |
| (-) Change in NWC | ($0.07) | ($0.20) | ($0.18) | ($0.14) | ($0.08) |
| **FCFF** | **($2.58)** | **($2.96)** | **($3.09)** | **($3.03)** | **($2.79)** |

| Risk-Free Rate | 4.3% | 10-Year US Treasury Yield (FT.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market assumption. |
| Beta | 1.64 | 5-year monthly beta, reflects higher risk of a small-cap company (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025). |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **3.9%** | **= $0.74M / $19.0M** (TTM Interest / Total Debt) |
| **WACC** | **6.3%** | **= (27.4% \* 12.5%) + (72.6% \* 3.9%)** |

| **Terminal Value (Gordon Growth)** | **($66.45M)** | **= (-$2.79M \* (1 + 2.0%)) / (6.3% - 2.0%)** |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.0% | Conservative estimate, aligned with long-term inflation expectations. |
| **Implied EBITDA Multiple** | N/A | EBITDA is negative in Year 5, making an exit multiple cross-check not meaningful. |

| PV of Forecast FCFF | ($12.87M) | Sum of discounted FCFF from Year 1-5 |

| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **($61.61M)** | **= -$12.87M + -$48.74M** |
| (-) Total Debt | $19.00M | (StockAnalysis.com, Jun 30, 2025) |
| (+) Cash & Equivalents | $0.96M | (StockAnalysis.com, Jun 30, 2025) |
| **Equity Value** | **($81.57M)** | **= -$61.61M - $19.00M + $0.96M** |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

The DCF analysis results in a negative equity value, which indicates that under the current assumptions, the company's projected cash flows do not support its existing debt and capital structure. The intrinsic value per share is effectively zero.

*   **Base Case Fair Value:** **$0.00**
*   **Low/Bear Case:** The base case already projects negative cash flows and a negative valuation. A bear case with lower revenue (e.g., continued decline) or further margin compression would result in an even more negative equity value.
*   **High/Bull Case:** A bull case would require a rapid return to high growth and positive operating margins. For example, achieving 2024 revenue levels ($32M) and a 5% positive EBIT margin by Year 5 could potentially yield a positive, albeit low, valuation. However, this is not supported by recent performance or management commentary.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** **$0.00**

### **I) Risk Notes**

1.  **Intense Competition:** As acknowledged by management, the entry of large competitors has severely impacted demand and pricing power, leading to a dramatic revenue and margin collapse.
2.  **Path to Profitability:** The company is currently unprofitable with deeply negative operating margins. The valuation is highly sensitive to assumptions about margin recovery, which depends on successful execution of operational streamlining.
3.  **Cash Burn:** The model projects negative free cash flow for the entire forecast period. With only $0.96M in cash, the company faces significant liquidity risk and may need to raise additional capital, potentially diluting shareholders.
4.  **Small-Cap Volatility:** The stock's high beta (1.64) reflects its sensitivity to market sentiment and the inherent risks of a small, growing company in a trendy consumer niche.
5.  **Dependence on Growth:** The valuation is contingent on a return to revenue growth. Failure to stabilize the top line and restart growth will make a positive investment outcome highly unlikely.

final answer is 0.00 $
