**Synthesis**

Booking Holdings scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its market leadership, financial strength, and long-term growth strategy. The company's "Connected Trip" initiative and investments in AI and machine learning are key to its future growth. The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the execution of the "Connected Trip" strategy and the impact of macroeconomic factors on travel demand. A successful execution of the "Connected Trip" could further solidify the company's market leadership and drive long-term growth. Conversely, a global economic slowdown could negatively impact travel demand and the company's financial performance. The "No" for labor relations could be changed to a "Yes" with more disclosure from the company on employee turnover and engagement metrics.

**Fisher Score is 14 / 15**
