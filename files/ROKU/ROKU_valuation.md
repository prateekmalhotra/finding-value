Of course. Here is a critical review and revised valuation of Roku, Inc., addressing the issues in the original analysis while maintaining the same structure and level of detail.

The initial valuation is well-structured but contains several assumptions that are likely too conservative, leading to an artificially low intrinsic value. Specifically, the terminal operating margin of 5.0% is low for a scaled platform business, and the handling of the high WACC in the terminal value calculation creates a significant distortion.

The following revision adjusts these assumptions to be more realistic—not overly optimistic, but reflective of a plausible successful future for the company—and refines the terminal value calculation.

### **PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)**

This section reverse-engineers the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price. *(This section is logically sound and provides a valuable baseline for comparison. No changes are needed here.)*

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

**1) Current Market Price**
*   **Market Price:** $93.68 (TradingView, August 22, 2025)

**2) Baseline Financials (TTM)**
The following trailing-twelve-months (TTM) financials are based on the period ended June 30, 2025.

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) | Source & Date |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,395 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Gross Margin | 43.8% | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |

| Total Debt | $567 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 147.3 | StockAnalysis.com, Aug 22, 2025 |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

*   **Market Capitalization:** $93.68/share * 147.3M shares = $13,799 million.
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** Market Cap + Total Debt - Cash = $13,799M + $567M - $2,253M = **$12,113 million**.
*   **Discount Rate (WACC):** A preliminary WACC of **17.59%** is calculated for this exercise (see Part 2 for full calculation), reflecting the stock's high beta.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
Given the high discount rate and current unprofitability, the market must price in a significant and rapid turnaround. To justify the **$12.1 billion** enterprise value, investors must believe Roku can achieve a combination of very high growth and substantial margin expansion. A plausible scenario is:

*   **5-Year Revenue CAGR: 20%**
*   **Year 5 Operating Margin: 15.0%**

**Conclusion for Part 1:** The market is pricing Roku not on its current performance but on a future state where it achieves significant scale (more than doubling revenue to ~$9.2B in 5 years) and transforms its business to become highly profitable, reaching a 15.0% operating margin, a level it has never historically achieved.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

This section builds an intrinsic value estimate from a revised, evidence-based standpoint.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6-7) Revenue for Years 1–5:**
The original model's growth taper is reasonable. We will adopt the same **15% growth rate in Year 1, tapering down by 2.5% each year to 5% in Year 5.** This acknowledges both near-term tailwinds from the shift to streaming and long-term competitive realities.

**8) Margin Path:**
The original 5% terminal operating margin is too conservative. As Roku scales its high-margin platform (advertising) revenue, operating leverage should allow for significantly better margins. While the market's implied 15% is aggressive, a target of **8.0% in Year 5** strikes a realistic balance. It represents a major operational achievement but remains well below the levels of mature ad-tech giants like Google or Meta. The path to this margin is modeled to begin in Year 1.

**9) Taxes:**
This assumption remains unchanged. Roku's net operating loss carryforwards will shield it from cash taxes in the near term. A **0% cash tax rate is assumed for the 5-year forecast period**, transitioning to the **21% U.S. statutory rate** for the terminal value calculation.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
These assumptions are sound.
*   **Capex:** **2.5% of revenue**, reflecting a normalized rate of investment.
*   **Change in Working Capital:** **5.0% of the change in revenue**, a standard assumption for a growing business.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
These assumptions are logical and will be maintained.
*   **SBC:** Treated as a real cash cost, declining from **8.5% of revenue in Year 1 to 6.5% in Year 5.**
*   **Dilution:** A **net 1.5% annual increase in diluted shares outstanding** to account for SBC issuance.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION (REVISED)**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Calculation:**
The FCFF formula is applied to the revised revenue and margin assumptions.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,054 | $5,686 | $6,255 | $6,755 | $7,093 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *15.0%* | *12.5%* | *10.0%* | *8.0%* | *5.0%* |
| EBIT | $0 | $114 | $250 | $405 | $567 |
| *Operating Margin* | *0.0%* | *2.0%* | *4.0%* | *6.0%* | *8.0%* |
| Tax on EBIT (0%) | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 | $0 |
| **NOPAT** | **$0** | **$114** | **$250** | **$405** | **$567** |
| (+) D&A | $369 | $415 | $457 | $493 | $518 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | ($430) | ($455) | ($469) | ($473) | ($461) |
| (-) Capex | ($126) | ($142) | ($156) | ($169) | ($177) |
| (-) Chg in Work Cap | ($33) | ($32) | ($28) | ($20) | ($17) |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **($220)** | **($100)** | **$54** | **$236** | **$430** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

*(The WACC calculation is arithmetically correct for the current period's high-risk profile. This rate will be used to discount the volatile 5-year forecast period. However, we will use a more stable Exit Multiple for the terminal value, which implicitly assumes the company's risk profile and WACC will normalize by Year 5.)*

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.26%
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.5%
*   **Beta:** 2.51
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 2.51 * 5.5% = 18.07%**

**15) Cost of Debt:**
*   **Cost of Debt = 4.26% + 2.0% = 6.26%** (Pre-tax).

**16) WACC Calculation:**
*   **WACC = (96.0%) * 18.07% + (4.0%) * 6.26% * (1-0) = 17.59%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE (REVISED)**

**17-18) Exit Multiple Method:**
The original analysis correctly noted that using a 17.59% WACC in a Gordon Growth formula produces an unrealistically low terminal value. The Exit Multiple method is more appropriate here as it reflects the market value of a more mature, stable company. A **10.0x EV/EBITDA multiple** is a reasonable and defensible assumption for a moderately growing, profitable media-tech platform. This is a common multiple for companies in this sector that have passed their hyper-growth phase but still command a premium over legacy media.

*   **Year 5 EBIT:** $567 million
*   **Year 5 D&A:** $518 million
*   **Year 5 EBITDA = $567M + $518M = $1,085 million**
*   **Terminal Value = 10.0 * $1,085M = $10,850 million**

This terminal value is substantially higher than the original, reflecting a more realistic exit valuation for a company achieving the projected financial profile.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE (REVISED)**

**19) Enterprise Value:**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** Sum of FCFF / (1+WACC)^t
    *   = (-$187) + (-$72) + $33 + $124 + $190 = **$88 million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $10,850M / (1 + 17.59%)^5 = **$4,799 million**
*   **Enterprise Value = $88M + $4,799M = $4,887 million**

**20) Equity Value:**
*   **Net Cash:** $2,253M Cash - $567M Debt = $1,686M
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value + Net Cash = $4,887M + $1,686M = $6,573 million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY (REVISED)**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   **Projected Shares in Year 5:** 147.3M * (1.015)^5 = **158.7 million shares**.
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $6,573M / 158.7M shares = $41.42 per share.**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $41.42.** Assumes a successful execution on a realistic path to 8% operating margins and moderating growth.
*   **Low/Bear Case: ~$15-20.** Assumes margin expansion stalls and revenue growth falters due to intense competition.
*   **High/Bull Case: ~$85-95.** Aligns more closely with the market's implied scenario, where growth remains high (15%+) and operating margins expand into the 12-15% range.

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 30% margin of safety from the revised base-case estimate.
*   **MOS Price = $41.42 * (1 - 0.30) = $29.00**

**Risk Notes**
1.  **Competition:** The TV streaming landscape is intensely competitive, with giants like Google, Amazon, and Apple, plus major TV manufacturers, all vying for platform dominance. This could perpetually suppress Roku's ability to achieve significant, sustained operating margins.
2.  **Monetization Risk:** The company's valuation is entirely dependent on its ability to monetize its user base through advertising and subscriptions. A slowdown in ad spending or an inability to secure favorable revenue shares would severely impact future cash flows.
3.  **High Beta & Discount Rate:** The stock's high volatility (Beta of 2.51) leads to a very high discount rate (17.59%). This means future cash flows are discounted very heavily, making the valuation highly sensitive to near-term performance. A failure to show a clear path to profitability could cause the market to lose patience, keeping the stock volatile.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The entire thesis rests on a successful transition from a "growth at all costs" model to one of durable profitability. There is significant execution risk in achieving the projected 8% operating margin without sacrificing the user growth needed to fuel the platform. The valuation is highly sensitive to this margin assumption.

final answer is 41.42 $
