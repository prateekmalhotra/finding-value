### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Year 1 | Years 2-3 | Years 4-5 | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | 32.5% | 15.0% | 8.0% | Y1 based on Q4 guidance annualization ($10.7B midpoint) and strong AI demand. Growth then moderates to reflect industry cyclicality and maturity. |
| **Operating Margin** | 28.0% | 29.0% | 29.0% | Starting near guided Non-GAAP gross margins adjusted for OpEx. Modest expansion assumed from improved pricing and mix, then stabilizing at a healthy mid-cycle level. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 13.0% | 15.0% | 15.0% | Y1 based on Q4 guidance. Reverts to a higher, more normalized rate thereafter, aligning with historicals excluding one-time items. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 30.0% | 28.0% | 25.0% | Near-term intensity reflects HBM and strategic investments. Tapers toward a more normalized historical average as major build-outs are completed. Based on ~$14B guidance. |
| **ΔWC as % of ΔRevenue** | 5.0% | 5.0% | 5.0% | Based on historical relationship between working capital and revenue growth. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 2.8% | 2.5% | 2.5% | Held consistent with recent TTM levels and then slightly declining as a percentage of higher revenues. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity), making it independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 44,802 | 51,523 | 59,251 | 64,000 | 69,112 |
| **EBIT** | **12,545** | **14,942** | **17,183** | **18,557** | **20,042** |
| Tax on EBIT | (1,631) | (2,241) | (2,577) | (2,784) | (3,006) |
| **NOPAT** | **10,914** | **12,700** | **14,605** | **15,774** | **17,036** |
| D&A | 9,857 | 11,335 | 13,035 | 14,080 | 15,205 |
| SBC | (1,254) | (1,288) | (1,481) | (1,600) | (1,728) |
| Capex | (13,441) | (14,426) | (16,590) | (16,000) | (17,278) |
| Change in WC | (550) | (336) | (386) | (237) | (256) |
| **FCFF** | **$5,526** | **$7,985** | **$9,283** | **$12,017** | **$12,979** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | `Rf + Beta * ERP` |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.29% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (YCharts, August 20, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.50% | Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta (5Y Monthly) | 1.35 | Reflects higher volatility than the market, typical for the cyclical semiconductor industry (Finbox, August 2025). |
| **Cost of Equity** | **11.72%** | `4.29% + 1.35 * 5.50%` |
| **Cost of Debt** | | `Interest Expense / Total Debt` |
| Cost of Debt (pre-tax) | 3.02% | ($489M / $16,213M). |
| Tax Rate | 15.0% | Mid-cycle forecast tax rate. |
| **Cost of Debt (after-tax)** | **2.56%** | `3.02% * (1 - 0.15)` |
| **WACC** | | `(E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd)` |
| Market Cap (E) | $131,223M | (1,119M shares * $117.21 share price as of Aug 20, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $16,213M | |
| Total Value (V) | $147,436M | |
| **WACC** | **10.74%** | `(131,223/147,436 * 11.72%) + (16,213/147,436 * 2.56%)` |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Inputs | Calculation | Result |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth** | `g = 2.5%`, `WACC = 10.74%` | `(12,979 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1074 - 0.025)` | **$161,909M** |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| `Median EV/EBITDA = 6.35x` (GuruFocus, 13-year median) | | |
| | Y5 EBITDA = $35,247M | `$35,247M * 6.35` | **$223,828M** |

**Decision:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value. This value will be used for the base case to adhere to the principle of realism over speculation.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Calculation | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Explicit FCFF** | `Sum of discounted Y1-Y5 FCFF` | **$34,310M** |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | `$161,909M / (1 + 0.1074)^5` | **$96,897M** |
| **Enterprise Value** | `PV of FCFF + PV of TV` | **$131,207M** |
| Less: Total Debt | | ($16,213M) |
| Plus: Cash & Equivalents | | $10,163M |
| **Equity Value** | `EV - Net Debt` | **$125,157M** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Metric | Calculation | Value |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Diluted Shares Outstanding | | 1,132M |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | `$125,157M / 1,132M` | **$110.56** |
| | | |
| **Low/Bear Case** | Lower growth (e.g., 25%/10%/5%), margin compression (26%). | **~$75-85** |
| **High/Bull Case**| Higher growth (e.g., 35%/20%/10%), margin expansion (31%). | **~$140-155** |
| | | |
| **Margin of Safety (30%)** | `$110.56 * (1 - 0.30)` | **$77.39** |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Industry Cyclicality:** The semiconductor memory market is notoriously cyclical. A downturn in demand or pricing pressure from oversupply could significantly impact revenue and margins, rendering forecasts inaccurate.
2.  **Geopolitical Risk:** A significant portion of the semiconductor supply chain is located in politically sensitive regions. Tariffs, trade restrictions, or disruptions in these areas could impact production and costs.
3.  **Technological Obsolescence:** The memory industry requires constant innovation. Failure to maintain a leading-edge position in next-generation technologies like HBM could erode competitive advantage and pricing power.
4.  **Capital Intensity:** Micron's business requires massive capital expenditures. Misallocation of capital or an inability to generate sufficient returns on these investments poses a significant risk to free cash flow generation.
5.  **Customer Concentration:** A large portion of revenue comes from a few large customers in the PC, mobile, and data center markets. The loss of a key customer could have a material impact on financials.
