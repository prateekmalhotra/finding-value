### **A) Baseline Financials (TTM)**

The Trailing Twelve Month (TTM) period is for the twelve months ended June 30, 2025. The calculation is: *TTM = Fiscal Year 2024 + First Half 2025 - First Half 2024*. All figures are in millions of USD.

### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

*   **Capital Expenditures:** "Our projected liquidity requirements for the balance of this year include capital expenditures for our existing operations of approximately $8.5 million. This includes $1.5 million to be incurred in 2025 for new desalination plants...and $700,000 for the expansion of Aerex's manufacturing facility." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 12, 2025).
*   **Growth Drivers:** Management expressed optimism about "strong retail water sales in Grand Cayman, stable bulk water operations, and anticipated improvements in design/build services revenue, particularly with the upcoming Hawaii project." (Q1 2025 Earnings Release, May 13, 2025).
*   **No specific revenue or margin guidance was provided.**

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5): 4.0%**
    *   **Rationale:** With no explicit guidance, a conservative 4.0% annual growth rate is projected. This is based on a blend of recent performance (excluding the volatility of large construction projects), strong retail demand from population growth in the Cayman Islands, and future opportunities like the Hawaii desalination plant. It is a realistic rate that does not assume speculative major contract wins.
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin): 13.7% (Stable)**
    *   **Rationale:** The TTM EBIT margin is estimated at 13.7% ($17.65M / $129.08M). Lacking specific management guidance on margin expansion, the model assumes a stable margin, reflecting a consistent business mix.
*   **Tax Rate: 8.5%**
    *   **Rationale:** Based on the effective tax rate from the past 12 months (8.13%) and historical norms for the company, which primarily pays taxes on its U.S. operations.
*   **Capital Expenditures (as a % of Revenue): 5.0%**
    *   **Rationale:** The TTM capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 5.0% ($6.45M / $129.08M). This aligns with the historical maintenance levels and is used as a baseline for projections.
*   **Change in Working Capital (as a % of Revenue Change): 5.0%**
    *   **Rationale:** Based on historical averages, a small outflow for working capital is assumed to support incremental revenue growth.
*   **Stock-Based Compensation (as a % of Revenue): 1.0%**
    *   **Rationale:** TTM SBC is approximately 1.0% of revenue ($1.35M / $129.08M). This is projected to remain stable.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - ∆ in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $134.24 | $139.61 | $145.20 | $151.01 | $157.05 |
| EBIT (13.7%) | $18.39 | $19.13 | $19.89 | $20.69 | $21.52 |
| NOPAT | $16.82 | $17.50 | $18.20 | $18.93 | $19.69 |
| (+) D&A | $6.71 | $6.98 | $7.26 | $7.55 | $7.85 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $1.34 | $1.40 | $1.45 | $1.51 | $1.57 |
| (-) Capex | $6.71 | $6.98 | $7.26 | $7.55 | $7.85 |
| (-) ∆ Working Capital | $0.26 | $0.27 | $0.28 | $0.29 | $0.30 |
| **FCFF** | **$15.22** | **$15.83** | **$16.47** | **$17.13** | **$17.82** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
    *   **Beta:** 0.54 (5-Year Monthly Beta). This beta is below 1.0, reflecting the company's stable, utility-like characteristics and lower volatility compared to the broader market.
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium).
    *   **Cost of Equity =** 4.29% + 0.54 * 5.0% = **6.99%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** Interest Expense / Total Debt
    *   **Calculation:** $0.10M / $3.48M = 2.87%. After-tax cost = 2.87% * (1 - 8.5%) = **2.63%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   **Formula:** (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   **Market Cap (E):** $516.03M (as of August 20, 2025).
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $3.48M.
    *   **WACC =** ($516.03 / $519.51) * 6.99% + ($3.48 / $519.51) * 2.63% = **6.97%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a reasonable long-term growth assumption, in line with long-run inflation expectations and sustainable for a mature utility business.
    *   **Terminal Value =** ($17.82 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0697 - 0.025) = **$409.0M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **TTM EBITDA:** EBIT ($17.65M) + D&A ($6.44M) = $24.09M
    *   **Enterprise Value (EV):** $405.20M
    *   **Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple:** $405.20M / $24.09M = 16.8x
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $21.52M (EBIT) + $7.85M (D&A) = $29.37M
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) =** $29.37M * 16.8x = **$493.4M**
    *   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value. The lower value of **$409.0M** will be used for the base-case valuation.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($15.22/1.0697¹) + ... + ($17.82/1.0697⁵) = **$69.41M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $409.0M / (1.0697⁵) = **$291.80M**
*   **Enterprise Value =** $69.41M + $291.80M = **$361.21M**
*   **(-) Net Debt:** Total Debt ($3.48M) - Cash ($112.25M) = **-$108.77M** (Net Cash).
*   **Equity Value =** $361.21M - (-$108.77M) = **$470.0M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** Equity Value / Diluted Weighted-Average Shares
    *   **Calculation:** $470.0M / 15.93M = **$29.50**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $29.50**. Assumes 4.0% revenue growth and stable 13.7% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $23.00**. Assumes slower growth (2.5%), margin compression to 12.0% due to regulatory pressure on the Cayman retail license, and a higher discount rate (8.0%).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $37.00**. Assumes higher growth (5.5%) from successful execution of new projects like in Hawaii, modest margin expansion to 15.0%, and a lower discount rate (6.5%).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% discount to the base-case fair value is applied for a margin of safety.
    *   **MOS Price =** $29.50 * (1 - 0.25) = **$22.13**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory Risk:** The company's most profitable segment, Cayman retail, is operating under an extended license while negotiating new terms with the regulator (OfReg), which has expressed a desire to reduce the segment's profitability. An unfavorable outcome could materially reduce future cash flows. (2024 10-K).
2.  **Customer Concentration:** A significant portion of bulk segment revenue comes from government-owned utilities in the Bahamas (WSC), which has a history of payment delays. Any disruption to these contracts or payments could adversely affect results. (2024 10-K).
3.  **Project Execution Risk:** Future growth is partly dependent on large-scale service projects, such as the new plant in Hawaii. Delays, cost overruns, or failure to win future contracts could hinder growth targets.
4.  **Geographic & Climate Risk:** Operations are concentrated in the Caribbean and are susceptible to natural disasters like hurricanes, which could damage infrastructure and disrupt operations.
