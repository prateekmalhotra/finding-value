### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used as it represents cash available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in NWC`

| (USD, millions) | Y1 (2026) | Y2 (2027) | Y3 (2028) | Y4 (2029) | Y5 (2030) |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market assumption).
    *   **Beta:** 0.94 (Source: Finviz, reflecting market risk similar to the broader market). Justification: As a large, established company in a mature industry, a beta close to 1.0 is reasonable.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 0.94 * 5.0% = 8.99%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = $444.4M / $9,206M = 4.83%.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.83% * (1 - 23.24%) = 3.71%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (Market Cap): $123,840M
    *   Market Value of Debt: $9,206M
    *   **WACC = (123,840 / 133,046) * 8.99% + (9,206 / 133,046) * 3.71% = 8.63%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a reasonable long-term growth assumption, in line with expected long-run inflation.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($5,231 * 1.025) / (8.63% - 2.5%) = $87,422M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **TTM EBITDA:** $5,949M (EBIT + D&A = 5377 + 572.4)
    *   **5-Year Historical Median EV/EBITDA:** ~20.0x
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $7,464M (EBIT Y5 + D&A Y5 = 6882 + 582)
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 20.0 * $7,464M = $149,280M**
    *   **Note:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value and will be used.

### **H) Per-Share Valuation & Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **$71,073M (Equity Value) / 409M (Shares) = $173.77**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $173.77**
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $145.21** (Assumes 4.0% revenue growth, 50bps margin compression, and 9.0% WACC).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $205.89** (Assumes 6.5% revenue growth, 70bps margin expansion, and 8.25% WACC).

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 25% margin of safety from the base-case value.
    *   **MOS Price = $173.77 * (1 - 0.25) = $130.33**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** ADP's growth is closely tied to employment levels. A significant economic downturn could reduce client headcount and new business bookings.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The HCM market is highly competitive, with threats from both established players and newer, technology-focused entrants. This could pressure pricing and margins.
3.  **Interest Rate Risk:** A portion of ADP's earnings is derived from interest on funds held for clients. A decline in interest rates could negatively impact this revenue stream.
4.  **Execution Risk:** The successful rollout of new products and AI initiatives is critical for maintaining a competitive edge and achieving guided growth.
5.  **Data Security:** As a custodian of sensitive client data, any security breach could result in significant financial and reputational damage.
