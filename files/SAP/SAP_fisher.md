The company is also launching major new products like the SAP Business Data Cloud, developed in partnership with Databricks, which has seen strong initial pipeline momentum.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP's R&D expense for fiscal year 2024 was a significant portion of its revenue, underscoring its commitment to innovation. The company's R&D efforts are increasingly focused on high-growth areas like Business AI and the Business Data Cloud. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, CEO Christian Klein highlighted that internal use of AI tools has made developers 30% more productive, accelerating the innovation pace. The successful launch and strong pipeline for the Business Data Cloud, along with market share gains in enterprise application SaaS, suggest R&D is effective and aligned with market demands.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP's sales performance shows strong momentum, evidenced by a 29% growth in current cloud backlog to €18.2 billion in Q1 2025. The company is successfully securing large, multi-year transformation deals with major global brands, including Hyundai, Kia, Mazda, Tyson Foods, and HUGO BOSS in Q1 2025 alone. The "GROW with SAP" offering for new customers is also performing well, with two-thirds of deals in Q1 being net new customers, such as the fitness brand Gymshark. This ability to win both large enterprise transformations and new mid-market clients points to a highly effective and adaptable sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP is demonstrating strong and improving profitability. In Q1 2025, the non-IFRS operating profit increased by 58% at constant currencies. The non-IFRS cloud gross margin expanded by 2.6 percentage points to 75%, a key indicator of the profitability of its strategic growth segment. This performance indicates that the company's core operations are highly profitable and that the shift to the cloud is becoming increasingly accretive to margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/) (April 22, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through a combination of operational efficiency and a favorable mix shift. The company completed a transformation program in 2024 which is now yielding operational efficiencies. CFO Dominik Asam highlighted "strict cost discipline" as a key driver of profitability in Q1 2025. Furthermore, SAP is leveraging its own AI tools internally; for example, "Joule for Consultants" saves up to 90 minutes per day, and developer productivity is up 30%, which helps decouple top-line growth from costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/) (April 22, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While direct metrics on labor relations were not detailed in the Q1 2025 call, the company is undergoing a significant transformation program that involves restructuring. The successful execution of the 2024 transformation program included a reduction of about 3,000 employees, with some rehiring in growth areas like AI. The ability to execute such a program while continuing to deliver strong results suggests a functional, if not outstanding, level of employee relations. Without more specific data on employee engagement or attrition, a definitive "Yes" is not supported.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/) (April 22, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable and aligned. The Q1 2025 earnings call was led by CEO Christian Klein and CFO Dominik Asam, who presented a consistent strategy and message. Recent executive announcements in January 2025 included the appointment of Sebastian Steinhaeuser to the Executive Board and the contract extension of board member Thomas Saueressig until 2028, indicating continuity and a forward-looking approach to leadership.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP's management structure extends beyond the CEO and CFO. The Executive Board includes leaders for distinct functional and operational areas. The January 2025 announcement of Sebastian Steinhaeuser leading a new "Strategy & Operations" board area and the extension of Thomas Saueressig's contract as head of "Customer Services & Delivery" demonstrate a clear structure with defined responsibilities at the highest level. This structure suggests a deep bench of senior executives managing key aspects of the business.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a company listed on both the NYSE and Frankfurt Stock Exchange, SAP adheres to rigorous accounting standards (IFRS) and regulatory requirements, including filing a Form 20-F with the SEC. The Q1 2025 earnings call provided detailed reconciliations between IFRS and non-IFRS figures and a clear breakdown of performance by segment and region. The company's ability to manage and report on a complex global business, including the execution of a major restructuring program, points to sophisticated cost and accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the enterprise software industry, ecosystem lock-in and data integration are critical competitive advantages. SAP's new Business Data Cloud strategy is a key differentiator. It creates a "semantic layer" that unifies a customer's entire data landscape (both SAP and non-SAP), which is a treasure trove for developing effective AI agents and providing a 360-degree view of the business. By opening up its data model, which Christian Klein called "the holy grail of SAP," the company is creating a powerful platform that is difficult for competitors to replicate and strengthens customer dependency on the SAP ecosystem.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is balancing near-term profitability with significant long-term investments. While delivering a 58% increase in operating profit in Q1 2025, the company is also investing heavily in strategic growth areas like AI and the Business Data Cloud. CFO Dominik Asam stated that while the company has a "cushion of several thousand employees we can play with" for cost control, they must balance near-term pressure "versus the mid-to-long-term needs to be future-proof." This indicates a willingness to reinvest for future growth rather than maximizing short-term profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/) (April 22, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP's financial position is exceptionally strong. The company generated €3.6 billion in free cash flow in Q1 2025 alone, an increase of 36% year-over-year. The company is not only self-funding its growth but is also returning significant capital to shareholders, having nearly completed a €5 billion share repurchase program as of April 2025. CFO Dominik Asam indicated that absent any major M&A, the company has the firepower to launch a new capital return program, suggesting no need for dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/) (April 22, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrated candor in the Q1 2025 earnings call. While highlighting strong headline numbers, they also proactively addressed areas of concern. CFO Dominik Asam acknowledged that the macroeconomic environment is "volatile and challenging" and that "transactional cloud revenues" experienced a "slight decline." The leadership team openly discussed the risks of escalating trade disputes and their potential impact on conversion rates, stating their outlook does not assume a "severe global recession" but that they are prepared to act prudently. This transparency on both successes and risks indicates a high level of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/SAP/transcripts/) (April 22, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SAP is a globally recognized company that has operated for over 50 years and is subject to the stringent regulations of the NYSE and Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The filing of a comprehensive Form 20-F, which includes extensive risk disclosures and audited financials, provides a high degree of transparency. A search for recent, major regulatory actions or scandals involving senior management does not reveal any red flags. The consistent financial reporting and governance disclosures support a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**
SAP scores very highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong market position, successful cloud transition, and robust financial health. The primary strengths are its dominant market share, a clear strategy for future growth through AI and the Business Data Cloud, and excellent financial discipline that is translating into strong margin expansion and cash flow. The only "No" was for Labor & Personnel Relations, which is not due to negative evidence but a lack of specific positive evidence in the reviewed documents to meet Fisher's high bar of "outstanding." The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the sustained adoption and revenue generation from the new Business Data Cloud, and management's ability to navigate macroeconomic headwinds, particularly trade disputes that could slow large enterprise deals. To flip the "No" to a "Yes," evidence such as declining employee attrition rates, high employee engagement scores from a reputable third party, or an external award for being a top employer would be required.

fisher score is 14 / 15
