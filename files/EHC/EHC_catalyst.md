### **Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Aggressive Capacity Expansion

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Encompass Health is actively expanding its capacity through the opening of new hospitals (de novo projects) and the addition of beds to its existing facilities. In Q1 2025, the company opened one new 40-bed hospital and added 25 beds to existing hospitals.
*   **Mechanism:** Increased capacity directly translates to higher patient volumes, driving revenue and earnings growth. New hospitals in underserved markets can capture significant market share, leading to improved profitability as they mature.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with new projects and expansions announced throughout the year. The impact of new builds will be realized over 0-12 months as they ramp up operations.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Slower-than-expected ramp-up of new facilities, leading to a 5% increase in patient volumes.
    *   **Base Case:** Continued successful execution of expansion plans, resulting in a 7-10% increase in patient volumes.
    *   **High Case:** Accelerated expansion and rapid market share capture, leading to a 10-12% increase in patient volumes.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a strong track record of successful de novo development and capacity expansion.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchases and Dividend Growth

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Encompass Health has an active share repurchase program and a history of paying and growing its dividend. In Q1 2025, the company repurchased $32.1 million of its common stock and declared a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can boost the stock price. Dividend payments provide a direct return to shareholders and signal the company's financial strength and commitment to shareholder returns.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with repurchase activity and dividend declarations occurring quarterly.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** A slowdown in the pace of share repurchases, resulting in a minimal impact on EPS.
    *   **Base Case:** Continued repurchases at the current pace, leading to a 1-2% reduction in shares outstanding annually.
    *   **High Case:** An accelerated repurchase program, potentially reducing shares outstanding by 3-5% annually.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 5-10%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a demonstrated commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong cash flow generation and a favorable outlook on the company's valuation.

    *   Quarterly announcements of share repurchase activity (Earnings releases).

    *   The company's cash flow from operations and free cash flow (Earnings releases).
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the company's financial performance could lead to a suspension of the repurchase program or dividend.
    *   A strategic acquisition could divert capital away from shareholder returns.
    *   A sharp increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. While a positive catalyst, the impact is likely to be less significant than the company's operational growth.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Strong Revenue and EBITDA Growth

    *   **Low Case:** A slowdown in revenue growth to the mid-single digits.

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current EBITDA: $1.2 billion
    *   EBITDA Multiple: 10x
