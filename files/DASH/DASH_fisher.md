### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash is expanding its services beyond restaurant delivery into groceries, retail, and other areas, significantly increasing its total addressable market (TAM). The global food and convenience delivery market is estimated at $300 billion and is expected to grow 10-15% annually through 2032. In the first quarter of 2025, the company reported an 18% year-over-year increase in total orders, reaching 732 million, and a 20% increase in Marketplace Gross Order Value (GOV) to $23.1 billion.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash's labor relations are mixed.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash's key competitive advantage lies in its strong network effects. A large base of consumers attracts more merchants, which in turn attracts more Dashers, creating a virtuous cycle. The company's early focus on suburban and smaller city markets allowed it to build a strong base in less competitive areas. DoorDash's proprietary logistics technology, which uses AI and machine learning to optimize deliveries, is another key differentiator.

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CEO Tony Xu has a long-term vision to build a last-mile logistics platform.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, DoorDash has a strong cash position and is generating positive free cash flow, with $505.00M in Q2 2025. The company's debt-to-equity ratio was 0.36 as of June 2025.

**Synthesis:**

DoorDash scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly in its growth potential, commitment to innovation, and dominant market position. The company's expansion into new verticals and international markets provides a long runway for growth, and its strong network effects create a significant competitive advantage. The company's recent achievement of profitability and strong free cash flow are also positive signs. However, the company faces challenges in its labor relations, with ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny over its classification of Dashers. The "D" rating of the executive team by employees also suggests internal issues that need to be addressed. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the outcomes of regulatory challenges, the successful integration of its recent acquisitions, and its ability to improve relations with its Dashers. A "No" to a "Yes" on labor relations and executive relations would significantly improve the score, and this would require a resolution of the independent contractor classification issue and improved employee sentiment.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
