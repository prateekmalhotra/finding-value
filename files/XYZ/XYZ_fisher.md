Block, Inc., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025; Q2 2025 Earnings Call on August 7, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block operates in the vast global payments and financial services industries. Its two primary ecosystems, Square and Cash App, are pursuing large addressable markets. Cash App aims to be a primary provider of banking services for U.S. households earning up to $150,000 annually. Square is expanding upmarket to serve larger businesses and growing internationally, with international gross payment volume (GPV) growth accelerating to 25% in Q2 2025. The continued development of integrated services like Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) through Afterpay, lending, and bitcoin services provides additional vectors for sustained growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's management consistently emphasizes product velocity and ecosystem expansion. Strategic priorities for the Square segment include growing with AI and further developing its banking offerings. For Cash App, the focus is on "Banking our Base" by launching additional banking services, moving upmarket to serve families, and building a "next-generation social bank". Recent news from August 2025 highlights the expansion of the Cash App and Afterpay partnership with Caleres and the unveiling of new bitcoin mining hardware, demonstrating a commitment to innovation beyond core payment processing.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's product development expenses were 13% of total net revenue in Q1 2025. The company's R&D efforts have successfully expanded both the Square and Cash App platforms from single-feature products into multi-faceted ecosystems. The effectiveness is demonstrated by the strong gross profit growth in both segments, with Cash App up 10% and Square up 9% in Q1 2025. The company is focused on increasing product velocity and is delivering more value "faster and more efficiently," as noted in the Q2 2025 earnings commentary.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGjmEXd8WxEmKf0IoATbi14SXR6i2_5j5HWeFCqierVC0HXrblDpgZTCP1j8fmWF323szKTZ74-mCKrDhguJgM1q2RWJcVbv3JZ6lOTTMrFvOU9wMh-CV4QFYlLJhagRn_Rru_tY4gd1NAZKEL_L4PfYSqkTch9uqdianyhsxDLxdKDQHrQxJbuYevQmTsKRHN05BiVPSnKOUc910fy3jaHQTtr7O6eIdvkGXD2N4Ru_cIP9agtLFF5H-DVA6G7YcnL (August 8, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block utilizes a multi-channel sales approach. For Cash App, the primary acquisition channel is the powerful network effect of its free peer-to-peer service. For the Square segment, the company employs direct marketing, online advertising, and a direct sales and account management team for larger sellers. The effectiveness is reflected in sustained growth, with Square's gross profit up 9% in Q1 2025 and 15% for the full year 2024, indicating successful customer acquisition and retention. The 25% acceleration in international GPV in Q2 2025 also points to an effective global go-to-market strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEzIj9Wng_Hugrojg8Dqd8WVOIXXqlw0biC4U0c6IFxtMcTwi9HWHOcvJ3PqhOv7LklnV7iHHYHEgJ2Ovip7nNVf6bDpa04s0uTduwMBZ3X8AGa_mYODWfzd5fP019aHO5OW0R3WPX9YV8-UpPtPUnFbOvpO9iDbNQnqCMWDFA6QMam1-OJ8oL8cXqoCvXiKm5KHgMOYADqwHYDveUdvUAJWSNJ72uu8fGneN_Wz1JaEWGUDyr_Omv1XbCJ78ba4foBiQ== (August 8, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block achieved a gross profit of $2.5 billion in Q2 2025, a 14% year-over-year increase. For the full year 2024, gross profit was $8.9 billion, up 18% year-over-year. The company is demonstrating operating leverage, achieving its highest quarterly adjusted operating income margin of 22% in Q2 2025. This indicates an ability to translate revenue into profit effectively, even as it continues to invest in growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEzIj9Wng_Hugrojg8Dqd8WVOIXXqlw0biC4U0c6IFxtMcTwi9HWHOcvJ3PqhOv7LklnV7iHHYHEgJ2Ovip7nNVf6bDpa04s0uTduwMBZ3X8AGa_mYODWfzd5fP019aHO5OW0R3WPX9YV8-UpPtPUnFbOvpO9iDbNQnqCMWDFA6QMam1-OJ8oL8cXqoCvXiKm5KHgMOYADqwHYDveUdvUAJWSNJ72uu8fGneN_Wz1JaEWGUDyr_Omv1XbCJ78ba4foBiQ== (August 8, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has sharpened its focus on cost efficiency and disciplined growth. A key initiative was implementing an absolute cap of 12,000 employees, which was achieved in 2024, to ensure the growth of the business outpaces the growth of the company. This opex discipline contributed to a 38% year-over-year increase in adjusted operating income in Q2 2025. The company continues to seek efficiencies through centralization of teams and prioritization of its scope.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEzIj9Wng_Hugrojg8Dqd8WVOIXXqlw0biC4U0c6IFxtMcTwi9HWHOcvJ3PqhOv7LklnV7iHHYHEgJ2Ovip7nNVf6bDpa04s0uTduwMBZ3X8AGa_mYODWfzd5fP019aHO5OW0R3WPX9YV8-UpPtPUnFbOvpO9iDbNQnqCMWDFA6QMam1-OJ8oL8cXqoCvXiKm5KHgMOYADqwHYDveUdvUAJWSNJ72uu8fGneN_Wz1JaEWGUDyr_Omv1XbCJ78ba4foBiQ== (August 8, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has adopted a "distributed work model," offering employees flexibility. However, it also implemented an employee cap and restructuring initiatives in 2024 and 2025, which included severance costs. While these actions are aimed at operational efficiency, workforce reductions can negatively impact morale. There is no widespread public information available from the search results to suggest either outstanding or poor labor relations. Lacking strong positive evidence, the standard is not met.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The leadership team, headed by co-founder Jack Dorsey, has been stable at the top. The dual-class share structure concentrates voting control with early stockholders, including executives, ensuring management stability and alignment with their long-term vision. The consistent presence of both Jack Dorsey (Block Head) and Amrita Ahuja (COO & CFO) on earnings calls suggests a cohesive and stable executive team leading the company's strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGbkHlOwwQhuesbAbYZshyt1qf_WYh6JBw6Z0R1DzkA82V4P-Q2sjti6g4bzZOEMmhPMbkbFAqddEo71Lf-R53WDGF9QpTDYUmjpC6ZVq0prYdrWirdXuImprBCShzLxlex26l-BY0S_ta70L8GEB1rNhO1ZBrizNUup2a-e6-MQkjV-z9jzLnQyFlAlA== (August 8, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's management structure is built around its two main ecosystems, Square and Cash App, with dedicated leadership for each. The company's filings name an executive team beyond the CEO, including a COO and CFO. While Jack Dorsey remains the public face and "Block Head," the consistent operational and financial updates provided by Amrita Ahuja on earnings calls demonstrate a depth of leadership beyond the founder. However, detailed succession planning is not extensively discussed in the provided materials.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGbkHlOwwQhuesbAbYZshyt1qf_WYh6JBw6Z0R1DzkA82V4P-Q2sjti6g4bzZOEMmhPMbkbFAqddEo71Lf-R53WDGF9QpTDYUmjpC6ZVq0prYdrWirdXuImprBCShzLxlex26l-BY0S_ta70L8GEB1rNhO1ZBrizNUup2a-e6-MQkjV-z9jzLnQyFlAlA== (August 8, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 Form 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm on the financial statements and on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's report also states that internal controls were effective. The company provides detailed segment reporting for Square and Cash App, breaking down revenue and gross profit, which allows for clear cost analysis by investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's key competitive advantage is the synergistic "ecosystem" strategy that creates network effects. The connection between the Square merchant ecosystem and the Cash App consumer ecosystem allows for closed-loop transactions (Cash App Pay at Square sellers), data advantages for underwriting (Square Loans), and increased customer stickiness. The company's strong, youth-oriented brand for Cash App and its simple, elegant product design for Square differentiate it in the crowded fintech and payments space.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management balances long-term investment with a recent focus on profitability. The company has invested heavily in building out its ecosystems, sometimes at the expense of short-term profits. However, recent actions, like the employee cap and a focus on adjusted operating income, show a commitment to profitable, durable growth. The Q2 2025 earnings call highlighted a raised forecast for full-year gross profit, indicating confidence in their strategy of balancing investment in product innovation with cost discipline to achieve long-term profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHp_a5aRpM9NEvYd_c-4oRzT2bRypi4RredG2MTM6VaxFkjKZSuXxHb6rw6wzlBAuRWfUnvumYpdIjut_ZeOPLpXpmZGjJvpoqe4SPbbV0N3Kmn1dzNTcpbK1lZ3cFSFabEExvVmYmuE09dLB_adINKG1S8y3gub8yKCYDt7Qk56o497vlyWDibFV8ZJT7npyzPbDwh4XsLQv_bXWkqHTw_Kb34r6aPSRxo-eODqx3JHyU3LlSaNTJq88s-qvuCdw== (August 7, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's financial position is strong. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $9.2 billion in available liquidity. The company has been actively returning capital to shareholders, repurchasing $1.8 billion of its stock as of March 31, 2025, under a $4 billion authorization. While the company did announce a $2.2 billion senior notes offering in August 2025, this is debt, not equity, financing. This strong liquidity and commitment to buybacks suggest a low risk of dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHPOV8-m-R52v9hM_TkOo3yEeti2YEE922lwFobb7HkR1U_rL1wbl-MUO3KummXnIUSmMX1U3sLlf5dT4pwxLOFYYmVN7fww69NFcf6JnEjZiqrzLesRWiRzaPoXMvvnBGA7VR4G97olIc6ud0= (August 13, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management communicates regularly through shareholder letters, earnings calls, and investor presentations. The company's 10-K and 10-Q filings disclose a range of risks and legal proceedings, including inquiries from the SEC and DOJ following a short-seller report in March 2023. While the company is cooperating with these inquiries, the proactive disclosure and willingness to address challenges in public filings suggests a commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHPOV8-m-R52v9hM_TkOo3yEeti2YEE922lwFobb7HkR1U_rL1wbl-MUO3KummXnIUSmMX1U3sLlf5dT4pwxLOFYYmVN7fww69NFcf6JnEjZiqrzLesRWiRzaPoXMvvnBGA7VR4G97olIc6ud0= (August 19, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is currently cooperating with inquiries from the SEC and DOJ following a March 2023 short-seller report that raised allegations about compliance practices. Additionally, the company is in a dispute with the City of San Francisco over gross receipts tax related to bitcoin sales and entered into a consent order with the NYDFS in April 2025 related to its compliance programs. While these are unresolved inquiries and disputes rather than findings of wrongdoing, the presence of multiple regulatory investigations prevents an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity at this time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm) (May 2, 2025)
***
**Synthesis:**
Block scores well on Fisher's criteria related to market potential, product development, profitability, and financial strength. The company's core strength lies in its dual-ecosystem strategy, which creates powerful network effects and significant growth runways in both the consumer and merchant spaces. Management has also demonstrated a recent and effective commitment to cost discipline, improving margins and profitability. The primary weaknesses in the analysis relate to a lack of clear evidence for outstanding personnel relations amidst restructuring and, more significantly, the presence of multiple regulatory inquiries that call into question the "unquestionable integrity" standard. The variables most likely to change this score in the next 12-24 months are the outcomes of the ongoing SEC and DOJ inquiries. A favorable resolution of these matters without material adverse findings would flip the "Integrity" score to "Yes" and significantly strengthen the investment case. Conversely, significant fines or mandated changes to business practices would reinforce the "No" and could negatively impact other areas of the analysis.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
