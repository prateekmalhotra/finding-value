### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest is pursuing several initiatives to expand its market potential. The airline is expanding into new channels like Google Flights, Kayak, and Skyscanner to attract new customers. They are also introducing new services like assigned and premium seating, 24-hour operations with "redeye" flights, and a new vacation package product, "Getaways by Southwest," to capture a larger share of the travel market. Furthermore, Southwest is seeking partnerships with international carriers, such as Icelandair, to expand its network globally. This strategy aims to leverage their existing domestic network to feed into international flights, opening up significant new revenue streams.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a clear commitment to developing new products and processes. The "Southwest. Even Better." transformation plan, announced in the third quarter of 2024, is a multi-faceted initiative to modernize the customer experience and improve financial performance. This includes significant changes to their long-standing business model, such as introducing assigned and premium seating options, evolving their boarding process, and launching "Getaways by Southwest." The company is also investing in technology to support these initiatives, including new systems for assigned seating, interline and codeshare capabilities, and 24-hour operations. These actions indicate a forward-looking management team willing to adapt and innovate to drive future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For an airline, R&D is better measured by innovation in operations, technology, and customer service. Southwest has a multi-year plan to invest over $2 billion to modernize the customer experience, including enhanced WiFi, in-seat power, and larger overhead bins. The company is also implementing a new revenue management system and digital-first service model to improve efficiency. While R&D as a percentage of revenue is not a standard metric for airlines, these significant investments in technology and customer-facing initiatives demonstrate a commitment to innovation that is substantial for its size. The move to assigned seating and partnerships with international carriers are also major strategic shifts that can be considered a form of product development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000111/luv-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000111/luv-20240630.htm) (July 25, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest has historically relied on a direct-to-consumer sales model through its website and app, which has been cost-effective. However, to attract new customers, they have recently expanded into new distribution channels such as Google Flights, Kayak, and Skyscanner. Their Rapid Rewards loyalty program is a key sales driver, and in early 2024, they enhanced it by allowing members to pay with a combination of cash and points. While they have a strong brand and loyal customer base, the recent need to expand into third-party channels suggests their historical sales organization may not have been capturing the entire addressable market.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Southwest's operating margin was 1.2%, and its net margin was 1.7%. While the company generated record operating revenues of $27.5 billion in 2024, its operating income was only $321 million. The company is facing significant cost pressures, particularly from labor contracts. The company has set a target of an annual operating margin of at least 10% in 2027.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm) (October 24, 2024)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest is actively pursuing several initiatives to improve profit margins. They are targeting over $500 million in annual cost savings by 2027 by minimizing hiring, optimizing scheduling, and improving corporate efficiency. They are also introducing higher-margin products like premium seating and "Getaways by Southwest." Additionally, the introduction of "redeye" flights is designed to increase aircraft utilization and lower unit costs. These actions demonstrate a clear focus on both cost reduction and revenue enhancement to improve profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm) (October 24, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, approximately 82% of Southwest's employees were represented by labor unions. Since October 2022, all 12 union-represented workgroups have ratified new contracts. While this indicates successful negotiations, the process has led to significant increases in labor costs, which is a major headwind for the company. The company has also been a defendant in class-action litigation regarding paid military leave. While Southwest has historically been known for a positive company culture, the recent cost pressures from new labor agreements and litigation suggest that labor relations are a significant challenge.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm) (October 24, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Southwest faced a significant challenge from activist investor Elliott Investment Management, which led to a major board shake-up. This included the appointment of several new directors and the resignation of the Executive Chairman and several other board members. While the company and Elliott reached a "Cooperation Agreement," the activist campaign and subsequent board changes indicate a period of significant turmoil and disagreement at the highest levels of the company.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm) (October 24, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest's 10-K lists a team of executive officers beyond the CEO, including a Chief Operating Officer, Chief Transformation Officer, and others, indicating a breadth of leadership. The company has also announced the upcoming retirement of its long-serving CFO, Tammy Romo, and CAO, Linda Rutherford, effective April 1, 2025, suggesting succession planning is underway. However, the recent activist-led board changes and the need to bring in several new directors could be interpreted as a sign that the previous management team and board were not seen as having the right skills to address the company's challenges.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest's financial statements are audited by Ernst & Young, LLP, which has issued an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and internal control over financial reporting. The 10-K provides detailed breakdowns of operating expenses and discusses various cost control initiatives. The company has not reported any material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting. This suggests that the company has robust accounting controls and a good handle on cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For decades, Southwest's point-to-point network, single aircraft type (Boeing 737), and open seating policy were key differentiators that contributed to its low-cost structure and competitive advantage. However, the company is now moving away from some of these long-standing practices by introducing assigned seating and partnering with other airlines. While this is a necessary evolution to adapt to changing customer preferences and market dynamics, it also means that Southwest is becoming more like its competitors. The company is still one of only two major U.S. airlines with an investment-grade rating from all three major credit agencies, which is a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest is making significant long-term investments that may impact short-term profitability but are aimed at securing future growth. The multi-billion dollar "Southwest. Even Better." transformation plan and the move to assigned seating are major undertakings that will require significant upfront investment. The company's focus on fleet modernization with more fuel-efficient aircraft also demonstrates a long-term perspective. The company has set long-term financial targets for 2027, including an operating margin of at least 10% and a return on invested capital of at least 15%, indicating a focus on long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm) (October 24, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest has a strong balance sheet and is one of only two major U.S. passenger airlines with an investment-grade rating from all three major credit agencies. As of December 31, 2024, the company had $7.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $1.2 billion in short-term investments. The company also has a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. In 2024, the company returned $680 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and has a new $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization in place. This strong financial position and commitment to returning capital to shareholders suggest a low risk of equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K and 10-Q filings provide detailed discussions of the challenges and risks it faces, including the impact of the December 2022 operational disruption, ongoing labor negotiations, and the activist investor campaign. The company also holds regular earnings calls with analysts where they answer questions about the business. The detailed disclosures regarding the activist campaign and the subsequent board changes demonstrate a willingness to be transparent about significant challenges.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000111/luv-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000111/luv-20240630.htm) (July 25, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238024000147/luv-20240930.htm) (October 24, 2024)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Southwest has been subject to a DOJ investigation into capacity collusion among major airlines and several class-action lawsuits. The company has also faced regulatory action and litigation related to the December 2022 operational disruption and other matters. While the company denies wrongdoing in these cases, the sheer volume of legal and regulatory issues raises questions. However, there is no evidence of intentional wrongdoing or a pattern of unethical behavior by management. The company has a code of conduct and appears to take its legal and regulatory obligations seriously.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/92380/000009238025000024/luv-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**

Southwest Airlines is at a critical juncture, moving away from its long-standing, highly successful business model to adapt to a changing market. The company's strongest positives are its commitment to long-term growth through significant investments in customer experience and technology, its strong balance sheet, and its candor with investors. However, the company faces significant challenges, including weak profit margins, strained labor and executive relations, and a history of legal and regulatory issues. The activist investor campaign in 2024 and the subsequent board shakeup highlight the urgency for the company to address its performance issues. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful implementation of the "Southwest. Even Better." transformation plan, particularly the move to assigned seating and international partnerships, and the ability to improve profit margins in the face of rising labor costs. To flip a "No" to a "Yes," the company would need to demonstrate sustained improvement in profitability, resolve its outstanding legal and regulatory issues, and show a period of stable and effective leadership following the recent board changes.
