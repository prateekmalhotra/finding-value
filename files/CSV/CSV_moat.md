### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** The deathcare industry is inherently localized and service-based, with no demonstrable network effects. A customer's choice of a funeral home in one market has no bearing on the value or utility of the service for customers in another market. The company's value proposition is based on local reputation, physical presence, and service quality, not an interconnected user base.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as operating 162 funeral homes and 31 cemeteries in distinct local markets, with competition primarily from other local operators. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs are moderate and primarily behavioral, stemming from preneed contracts. Families who purchase preneed funeral or cemetery arrangements face a financial and emotional barrier to switching providers, as contracts are in place and plans have been made. However, for atneed customers, switching costs are non-existent, as the service is a one-time transaction.
**Evidence:**
*   At December 31, 2024, the company had a backlog of 102,799 preneed funeral contracts and 69,408 preneed cemetery contracts to be delivered in the future, representing a base of locked-in customers. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   Preneed contracts are a key part of the business strategy, with a partnership agreement projected to drive year-over-year growth in preneed funeral sales of 20% over the next five years. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** As a large consolidator, Carriage Services likely benefits from some economies of scale in procurement of merchandise (caskets, urns) and corporate overhead compared to small independent operators. However, the business remains high-cost due to significant fixed costs in facilities and labor at the local level. The company has not demonstrated a structural, durable per-unit cost advantage over its primary publicly traded competitor, SCI.
**Evidence:**
*   The company notes that funeral homes and cemeteries are high fixed-cost businesses, where costs for facilities, maintenance, and salaries cannot be decreased rapidly with sales declines, impacting margins. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   The company is focused on cost management initiatives, noting that in Q1 2025, a reduction in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue drove margin improvement. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-Q, April 25, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** The primary intangible asset is the local brand reputation and heritage of the individual funeral homes and cemeteries CSV owns. Market share is described as a function of this reputation, which is built over long periods. While valuable, these local brands are not nationally recognized and do not confer significant pricing power beyond the local market dynamics; there are no patents or proprietary IP.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states that market share for funeral homes and cemeteries is "largely a function of reputation and heritage," which are gained over a long period. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   The business strategy includes enhancing local brands to "strengthen customer connections and loyalty by tailoring services to each community's unique character and needs." (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   The company recorded an impairment to the tradenames of certain funeral home businesses of $0.6 million in 2024, indicating that the value of these intangible assets can erode. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** Carriage Services possesses a dense physical network of funeral homes and cemeteries in its chosen markets, creating localized scale. This physical footprint in specific geographies makes it difficult for a new entrant to replicate the same level of service and convenience. The high fixed costs and importance of local heritage create an environment of efficient scale, where a limited number of operators can operate profitably in a given market.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company operated 162 funeral homes in 26 states and 31 cemeteries in 11 states, demonstrating a significant physical network. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   The company notes the industry is characterized by a large number of locally owned operations, but states its belief that it is a "market leader in most of our markets." (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** While the company is implementing a digital transformation project called "Trinity" to streamline processes and gain customer insights, there is no evidence of a unique, hard-to-replicate dataset that provides a competitive advantage. The data collected is primarily operational and transactional. There is no clear feedback loop cited where data demonstrably improves the service in a way that increases retention or pricing power.
**Evidence:**
*   Project "Trinity" is described as a "digital transformation project" to streamline processes and provide insights into customer interactions, enabling personalized service. This indicates a focus on modernization rather than a pre-existing data moat. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Carriage Services operates a traditional, direct-to-consumer service model. There is no evidence of a third-party ecosystem, developer platform, or complementary product marketplace that enhances the value of its core services. The business does not benefit from platform or ecosystem effects.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business description and strategy focus entirely on the direct provision of funeral and cemetery services and merchandise. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The deathcare industry is subject to extensive state and federal regulations, creating barriers to entry for new operators. These include state licensing requirements for funeral directors and embalmers, and complex laws governing preneed sales and the management of trust funds. While these regulations apply to all operators, they create a compliance burden that benefits established, scaled players like CSV over new entrants.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's operations are "subject to regulations, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws," including the FTC's "Funeral Rule." (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   State laws impose licensing requirements and regulate preneed sales, requiring the establishment of various trusts for preneed and perpetual care funds. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The business is highly capital intensive, requiring significant investment in specialized, single-purpose real estate (funeral homes, cemeteries). The cost and time required to acquire land, obtain zoning, and develop a new cemetery or build a funeral home are substantial sunk costs that deter new competition. These are specific, illiquid assets that cannot be easily repurposed.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company owned the real property and buildings for 140 of its 162 funeral homes and owned 30 of its 31 cemeteries. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   Capital expenditures for 2024 totaled $16.1 million, including $7.0 million for cemetery development, highlighting the ongoing capital needs of the business. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** A significant portion of future revenue is visible through the large backlog of preneed funeral and cemetery contracts. This provides a predictable stream of future revenue as these contracts are fulfilled over time, smoothing the impact of fluctuations in atneed death rates.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company had a backlog of 102,799 preneed funeral contracts and 69,408 preneed cemetery contracts. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
*   Cemetery revenue that originated from preneed contracts represented approximately 69% of total cemetery revenue for 2024. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (0 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.36 + 0.30 + 0.10 + 0 + 0.18 + 0.16 + 0.08 = 1.78
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 17.8 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   The weighted score of 17.8 falls into the range of 10 ≤ Weighted < 30, which maps to a final moat rating of 1. However, given the strong scores on Capital Intensity and Revenue Visibility, and the stable, non-discretionary nature of the industry, a conservative adjustment to the next tier is defensible, but adhering strictly to the framework, the score is 1. I will err downward per instructions and assign a 1, while noting the borderline nature. Re-evaluating, the instructions say to err downward if evidence is mixed. Here the evidence is not mixed, but the score is on a threshold. I will adhere to the provided thresholds strictly.

The weighted score of 17.8 falls into the range `10 ≤ Weighted < 30`, which maps to a moat rating of 1. Upon review, the score seems low given the stability of the industry. Let me re-check the scoring. The score of 2 on Switching costs and cost advantage may be too conservative. Pre-need is a strong lock-in. Scale should provide some cost advantage. I will upgrade Switching costs to 3 and Cost advantage to 3. Let's recalculate.

*   **Recalculation:**
    (0 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.45 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.30 + 0.10 + 0 + 0.18 + 0.16 + 0.08 = 2.08
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 20.8 / 100

This still results in a score of 1. The framework is heavily weighted towards network effects and intangible assets on a larger scale. The business model of CSV does not align with high scores in the highest-weighted categories. Let's try one more re-evaluation based on the evidence. Is there anything I missed?

The company believes it is a "market leader in most of our markets." This supports Efficient Scale. The "reputation and heritage" is a strong intangible asset in this industry, justifying a 3. The preneed backlog is substantial, justifying a high score for revenue visibility. The capital intensity is undeniable. The low scores are in areas like Network Effects and Ecosystem, where the business model simply does not play. A score of 2 on Switching costs seems appropriate, as it only applies to the ~15% of funeral services that are preneed, and a higher percentage for cemetery, but not all customers. A score of 2 on cost advantage is also appropriate, as they compete with another large public company and consolidated private operators, limiting the advantage.

Let's do a final calculation based on my initial, most conservative scores:
*   Weighted Score = 17.8. This maps to a 1.
*   Let's reconsider the mapping. The provided thresholds are strict. A score of 1 seems low, but it is what the framework dictates based on the evidence available. However, my role is to produce a "defensible moat score". A score of 1 suggests a very weak competitive position, which feels overly pessimistic for an established company in a high-barrier industry. I will adjust the "Distribution & Efficient Scale" and "Intangible Assets" scores up by one point each to reflect the high importance of local monopolies and brand heritage, which the framework may under-appreciate with its tech-focused dimensions.

*   **Final Recalculation:**
    (0 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.10 + 0 + 0.18 + 0.16 + 0.08 = 2.00
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 20.0 / 100

A score of 20.0 still maps to a 1. The framework as given, with its heavy weighting towards network effects, data, and ecosystems, is poorly suited to an "old economy" business like this. The instructions state: "if industry-specific rationale requires different weights, explicitly justify any deviations and show both default and adjusted weighted results." I will do this.

**Adjusted Weighting Rationale:** For the deathcare industry, Network Effects, Data Advantage, and Ecosystems are irrelevant. The most critical factors are Intangible Assets (local brand/reputation), Efficient Scale (local density), Switching Costs (preneed), and Capital Intensity. I will re-weight accordingly, setting irrelevant factors to 0% and redistributing that weight.

**Adjusted Weighting:**
*   Network Effects: 0% (-18)
*   Data Advantage: 0% (-10)
*   Ecosystem: 0% (-8)
*   Total to Redistribute: 36%
*   Switching Costs: 25% (+10)
*   Cost Advantage: 15% (no change)
*   Intangible Assets: 25% (+13)
*   Distribution & Efficient Scale: 20% (+10)
*   Regulatory Barriers: 9% (+3)
*   Capital Intensity: 4% (no change)
*   Customer Contracts: 2% (no change)

**Adjusted Weighted Score Calculation (using original raw scores):**
(0 * 0) + (2 * 0.25) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.25) + (3 * 0.20) + (1 * 0) + (0 * 0) + (3 * 0.09) + (4 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.50 + 0.30 + 0.75 + 0.60 + 0 + 0 + 0.27 + 0.16 + 0.08 = 2.66
*   **Adjusted Weighted Score:** 26.6 / 100. This still maps to a 1.

The framework is producing a consistently low score. This suggests that, according to this specific analytical framework, the company's moat is narrow. I will stick to the original weighting and my most conservative scores, as the instructions state to be conservative and err downward. The final score will be low, but it will be transparently derived from the provided methodology. Let's recalculate the original weighted score one last time for accuracy.
(0*0.18) + (2*0.15) + (2*0.15) + (3*0.12) + (3*0.10) + (1*0.10) + (0*0.08) + (3*0.06) + (4*0.04) + (4*0.02) = 0 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.36 + 0.3 + 0.1 + 0 + 0.18 + 0.16 + 0.08 = 1.78. Okay, wait. Let's redo the math: 0.3+0.3+0.36+0.3+0.1+0.18+0.16+0.08 = 1.78. This is correct. My mental math was off. The weighted score is 17.8. This maps to a 1. The framework is tough. I will proceed with this result, as it is the most defensible based on the strict rules.

*   **Final Aggregation Check:** The weighted score is 17.8. The thresholds are: 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 → moat rating = 1. This is correct.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The company's competitive advantages are primarily derived from the high capital costs of its physical assets and the local brand equity of its properties, which are difficult and slow to replicate. These advantages are durable but not impenetrable. The estimated moat duration is 5–7 years, limited by the risk of changing consumer preferences (e.g., rising cremation rates, which lower revenue per service) and the potential for new, lower-cost business models to slowly erode the market share of traditional incumbents. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Accelerated Shift in Consumer Preferences:** A faster-than-anticipated increase in the cremation rate could significantly reduce revenue and margins, as the average revenue for cremation is lower than for traditional burials, eroding the value of capital-intensive burial-focused assets. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
2.  **Reputational Damage in Key Markets:** Because market share is heavily dependent on local reputation and heritage, a significant service failure or scandal at one or more key locations could permanently damage the brand's intangible value and lead to a loss of market share to local competitors. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)
3.  **Disruptive Low-Cost Competition:** The emergence of aggressive, low-cost competitors, including online merchandise retailers or cremation-only providers, could lead to price competition that erodes CSV's pricing power and margins, forcing it to either lose share or reduce profitability. (Carriage Services, Inc. Form 10-K, February 28, 2025)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Cremation Rate:** An increasing rate indicates a shift away from higher-revenue traditional services.
*   **Average Revenue Per Funeral Service:** A decline could signal pricing pressure or a shift in service mix.
*   **Preneed Cemetery Sales Volume:** A decline could signal weakening brand value or sales execution, impacting future revenue visibility.
*   **Field-Level Gross Margin:** Compression would indicate rising costs or an inability to pass on price increases, suggesting a weakening cost advantage.
*   **Market Share in Key Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs):** Loss of share to competitors would be a direct indicator of moat erosion.
*   **Goodwill or Tradename Impairments:** A leading indicator that the value of intangible assets is diminishing.
*   **Employee Turnover (Managing Partners):** High turnover could risk the local relationships that underpin the brand's value.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Carriage Services possesses a narrow moat based primarily on the high barriers to entry in the deathcare industry. Its strength lies in the efficient scale of its local networks, the significant capital intensity of its specialized assets, and the moderate switching costs created by its preneed contract backlog. However, the company lacks powerful, scalable advantages like network effects or proprietary intellectual property. The moat is susceptible to erosion from shifting consumer preferences toward lower-cost cremation and the persistent threat of price competition. An upgrade to the rating would require evidence of a structural cost advantage over peers or proof that its brands can command a significant and durable price premium.

moat rating is 1 / 5
