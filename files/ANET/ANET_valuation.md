Of course. Here is a critique and a revised version of the valuation for Arista Networks Inc. (ANET), addressing the identified issues while maintaining the original structure and intent.

### **Critique of the Original Valuation**

The provided valuation is well-structured, detailed, and demonstrates a strong thought process. The use of a reverse DCF to frame market expectations is excellent, and the rationale behind most assumptions is clearly articulated. However, there are a few critical issues, primarily in the calculation of Free Cash Flow (FCFF) and the resulting terminal value, which lead to an overly conservative final value.

**Key Issues Identified:**

1.  **Omission of Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) Add-Back:** The most significant flaw is in the FCFF calculation. The formula provided is `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in WC`, but the note below it states, "D&A is assumed to be included within the Capex forecast for simplicity." This is conceptually incorrect. D&A is a non-cash expense that is added back to NOPAT to arrive at cash flow, while Capex is a separate cash outflow. The calculation in the table omits the D&A add-back, which incorrectly understates the cash-generating ability of the business in every forecast year.
2.  **Overly Conservative Terminal Value (GGM Implication):** The original analysis correctly identified that the Gordon Growth Method (GGM) produced an unrealistically low implied exit multiple of 8.75x. This was a great cross-check. The decision to switch to an Exit Multiple was the right one. However, the calculation was based on the flawed (understated) FCFFs. Fixing the FCFF calculation is the primary lever to arrive at a more realistic valuation.
3.  **WACC Assumption:** While the WACC calculation of 10.26% is mathematically sound based on the inputs, a beta of 1.2 and an ERP of 5.0% for a company that is a market leader with no debt could be seen as slightly aggressive. For the revised version, I will use a slightly more moderate set of assumptions to reflect the company's strong financial position and market leadership, which can temper its volatility over the long term.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

*(This section is logically sound and serves its purpose as a benchmark. It is retained without change.)*

**A) Establish Baseline & Market Price**

**1) Current Market Price**

*   **ANET Stock Price:** $133.25 (at close, August 22, 2025)
*   **Diluted Shares Outstanding (TTM):** 1,279 million (as of June 30, 2025)
*   **Market Capitalization:** $133.25 * 1,279 million = $170,426.75 million

**2) Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months - TTM)**

| Metric | Amount (USD Millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $7,951 |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $3,430 |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $41 |
| **Cash & Equivalents** | $8,844 |
| **Total Debt** | $0 |

**B) Reverse-Engineer Assumptions**

**3-5) Market-Implied Assumptions**

Based on the reverse DCF, to justify the closing price of $133.25 on August 22, 2025, an investor would need to believe Arista Networks can achieve the following:

*   **5-Year Revenue CAGR:** Approximately **21.5%**
*   **Operating Margin:** Maintained at the current high level of **43.1%**

This implies a belief that Arista will grow its revenue from ~$8 billion to ~$21 billion over the next five years while maintaining its current, historically high profitability.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Balanced Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on corrected calculations and balanced, realistic assumptions.

**C) Formulate Balanced Assumptions (5 Years)**

**6-7) Revenue for Years 1–5**

The market-implied growth is aggressive. A tapering growth rate remains the most prudent assumption.
*   **Analyst's Assumption:** I will use a **20%** growth rate for Year 1, tapering down by 3% annually to **8%** in Year 5. This acknowledges strong current AI demand while modeling a normalization of growth over the medium term.

**8) Margin Path**

*   **Analyst's Assumption:** A stable **40.0% operating margin** will be used. This is below the current peak (43.1%) but above the recent historical average (38.2%), reflecting sustained efficiency and market leadership.

**9) Taxes**

*   **Analyst's Assumption:** A **15.0%** effective tax rate will be used.

**10) Capital Intensity**

*   **D&A:** Historically, D&A has been a small percentage of revenue.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** D&A will be modeled at **0.6% of revenue**.
*   **Capex:** Historically low, but may increase slightly with scale.
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Capex will be modeled at **1.0% of revenue**.
*   **Working Capital:**
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** Change in Working Capital will be **22.0% of the change in revenue** each year.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks**

*   **SBC:**
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** SBC will be modeled at a stable **4.5% of revenue**.
*   **Share Count:**
    *   **Analyst's Assumption:** A net **0.5% annual reduction** in shares outstanding.

**D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**12) FCFF Calculation (Y1-Y5)**

*   **Formula (Corrected):** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $9,541 | $11,163 | $12,726 | $14,126 | $15,256 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *20.0%* | *17.0%* | *14.0%* | *11.0%* | *8.0%* |
| EBIT (40.0% margin) | $3,816 | $4,465 | $5,090 | $5,650 | $6,102 |
| EBIT * (1-Tax) | $3,244 | $3,795 | $4,327 | $4,803 | $5,187 |
| **+ D&A (0.6% of Rev)** | **$57** | **$67** | **$76** | **$85** | **$92** |
| \- SBC (4.5% of Rev) | -$429 | -$502 | -$573 | -$636 | -$687 |
| \- Capex (1.0% of Rev) | -$95 | -$112 | -$127 | -$141 | -$153 |
| \- Chg in WC | -$350 | -$357 | -$344 | -$308 | -$249 |
| **Free Cash Flow** | **$2,427** | **$2,891** | **$3,359** | **$3,803** | **$4,190** |

**13) Rationale for FCFF**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents the cash available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM)**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 22, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%.
*   **Beta:** 1.15. Revised slightly lower to reflect the company's debt-free balance sheet and strong market position, which provides more stability than a pure tech hardware peer.
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.15 * 5.0% = 9.99%**

**15) Cost of Debt**

*   Arista Networks has no debt; this is not applicable.

**16) WACC Calculation**

*   As the company is 100% equity financed:
*   **WACC = Cost of Equity = 9.99%**

**F) Terminal Value**

**17) Gordon Growth Method vs. Exit Multiple**

The original analysis correctly identified that a GGM with these inputs (WACC ~10%, g ~2.5%) yields an unrealistically low implied multiple. An Exit Multiple approach is more appropriate for a high-quality company that will likely still be growing faster than the economy and command a premium multiple at the end of the forecast period.

**18) Terminal Value (Exit Multiple Method)**

*   **Year 5 EBITDA:**
    *   EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $6,102 + $92 = **$6,194 million**
*   **Exit Multiple:** The tech hardware sector median is 15x-20x EV/EBITDA. For a best-in-class, high-margin leader like Arista, a multiple at the higher end of the peer range is appropriate. A **17.0x multiple** strikes a realistic balance, reflecting maturity but also sustained quality and profitability.
*   **Terminal Value = $6,194 million * 17.0 = $105,298 million**

**G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

**19) Enterprise Value**

*   PV of Explicit FCFF = ($2,427/1.0999¹) + ($2,891/1.0999²) + ($3,359/1.0999³) + ($3,803/1.0999⁴) + ($4,190/1.0999⁵) = $2,206 + $2,389 + $2,525 + $2,609 + $2,602 = **$12,331 million**
*   PV of Terminal Value = $105,298 / (1.0999⁵) = **$65,716 million**
*   **Enterprise Value = $12,331 + $65,716 = $78,047 million**

**20) Equity Value**

*   **Formula:** Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash & Equivalents
*   **Net Cash:** $8,844 million
*   **Equity Value = $78,047 + $8,844 = $86,891 million**

**H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value**

*   **Projected Year 5 Share Count:** 1,279 million * (1 - 0.005)⁵ = 1,247 million shares
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $86,891 / 1,247 = $69.68 per share**

**22) Valuation Range**

*   **Base Case: $69.68.** (As calculated).
*   **Low/Bear Case: ~$52.** (Assumes slower revenue growth [e.g., 15% tapering to 5%], and margin compression to 37%).
*   **High/Bull Case: ~$91.** (Assumes higher revenue growth [e.g., 25% tapering to 10%], and margins sustained at 42%).

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**

*   A 30% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate.
*   **MOS Price = $69.68 * (1 - 0.30) = $48.78**
