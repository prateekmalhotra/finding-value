**Addus HomeCare Corporation (ADUS), August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.**

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Addus operates in the personal care, hospice, and home health markets, which are poised for growth due to the aging U.S. population. The company's services are a lower-cost alternative to facility-based care, a model favored by consumers and payors. Management noted in its Q2 2025 earnings call that the Personal Care segment, a key driver of the business, saw a 7.4% organic revenue growth rate over the prior year. The company is also expanding its presence in various states through strategic acquisitions, such as the Gentiva Personal Care operations, indicating a clear path for continued sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy is heavily focused on growth through acquisitions to expand into new markets and add clinical care services to its existing offerings. The completion of two acquisitions in 2023 and two in 2024, including the significant Gentiva acquisition, demonstrates this commitment. The company's active pipeline and focus on identifying growing markets with favorable demographics underscore a forward-looking approach to development. Addus also invests in technology, such as Electronic Visit Verification (EVV) and the Qlik Business Intelligence platform, to drive efficiencies and enhance service delivery.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a services company, Addus's "R&D" is focused on technology and process improvement rather than product development. The company utilizes multiple vendor-hosted applications for patient accounting, EVV systems to comply with federal mandates, and the Qlik Business Intelligence platform for performance analysis. It has also introduced an AI-powered assistant for recruitment. While the 10-K mentions these technology investments, it does not provide specific metrics on R&D spending as a percentage of revenue or quantifiable outcomes of these investments, making a direct assessment of effectiveness difficult.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Addus's "sales" are driven by securing referrals and contracts with government agencies, managed care organizations (MCOs), and other healthcare providers. The company's strategy focuses on partnering with MCOs, leveraging its scale and technology as a competitive advantage. The ability to consistently grow revenue, with a 21.8% increase in Q2 2025 year-over-year, and achieve a 7.4% same-store revenue growth in its core Personal Care segment, demonstrates an effective sales and market development effort. The company's growth is closely tied to its ability to maintain existing and establish new payor relationships, which it has successfully demonstrated.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT) (August 5, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Addus reported a gross profit margin of 32.5% and an operating margin of 8.9%. In the second quarter of 2025, the company reported an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.6%, an increase from 12.4% in the same quarter of the previous year. This indicates stable and slightly improving profitability. While direct peer comparisons are not provided in the documents, the consistent and positive margins in a sector heavily reliant on government reimbursement rates suggest worthwhile profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT) (August 5, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Addus focuses on leveraging its scale with MCOs to secure favorable contracts and drive organic growth, which can improve margins. The company is also attentive to state-level reimbursement dynamics, benefiting from rate increases in key states like Illinois that help offset rising labor costs. Furthermore, Addus utilizes technology to create efficiencies in its operations. The slight increase in adjusted EBITDA margin to 12.6% in Q2 2025 from 12.4% in Q2 2024 demonstrates the effectiveness of these ongoing efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT) (August 5, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, approximately 34.8% of Addus's employees were represented by labor unions. The company states it maintains "strong working relationships with these labor unions." Addus has a "People Development and Experience Department" and initiatives like "Addus CARES" to attract and retain talent, and its employee engagement survey showed an 80% satisfaction rating for work-life balance. However, the need to constantly renegotiate numerous collective bargaining agreements and the inherent risks of work stoppages in a highly unionized workforce present ongoing challenges. While the company has formal programs, the evidence of "outstanding" relations is not definitive.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K and recent earnings call transcripts do not reveal any signs of instability or conflict among the executive team or with the board. The executive team has been leading the company through a period of significant growth and strategic acquisitions, suggesting a cohesive and functioning leadership group. The company's filings detail employment and non-competition agreements for its named executive officers. Without evidence of internal strife, and given the company's steady execution of its strategy, relations appear stable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT](httpshttps://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT) (August 5, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Addus has specific employee development programs, "Ignite" and "Emerge," designed to equip new leaders and cultivate a diverse internal leadership pipeline for future promotions, which indicates a focus on building management depth. The executive team listed in filings and on earnings calls includes a CEO, CFO, President, and COO, suggesting a distribution of leadership responsibilities. This structured approach to leadership development and clear roles at the top suggest a sufficient bench of talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT) (August 5, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Addus's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024. The company's independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, audited and confirmed the effectiveness of these controls. The financial statements provide segment-level data on revenues and operating income, allowing for a degree of cost analysis. There is no mention of recent restatements or material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive factor in home care is the ability to secure contracts with MCOs, which are increasingly managing government-funded care. Addus's strategy explicitly targets MCOs, leveraging its large scale, technology infrastructure, and ability to offer a continuum of care (personal, home health, hospice) as a competitive advantage in a fragmented industry. This ability to be a preferred, multi-service partner for large payors in a consolidating industry is a significant positive clue about its competitive position. The company's successful M&A strategy also allows it to build density in key markets, another competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's growth strategy is centered on acquisitions and expanding its service offerings in key states, which inherently requires a long-term perspective. Significant investments in acquisitions like Gentiva are made with an eye toward future growth and market positioning rather than immediate, short-term profit maximization. The company's consistent reinvestment in its business through M&A and technology, while managing profitability, indicates a balanced but long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Addus has historically used a mix of cash, debt, and equity to fund its growth. On June 28, 2024, the company completed a public offering of 1,725,000 shares of common stock, raising approximately $175.6 million in net proceeds to repay debt and fund acquisitions, including Gentiva. While the company has a credit facility with available borrowing capacity ($346.6 million as of December 31, 2024), this recent and significant equity issuance demonstrates that it will resort to dilutive financing to fund major strategic acquisitions. Therefore, there is a clear risk of future dilution for large-scale growth initiatives.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company holds regular quarterly earnings calls and provides detailed financial results and commentary on its performance. The Q2 2025 earnings call transcript provides a clear breakdown of performance by segment, discusses growth drivers, and provides forward-looking commentary. The 10-K includes an extensive "Risk Factors" section detailing numerous potential challenges, including regulatory risks, labor issues, and reimbursement pressures. This level of disclosure in standard filings and investor communications suggests a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT) (August 5, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K and recent transcripts do not indicate any material legal proceedings, regulatory actions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of management. The company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and its financial controls are audited and deemed effective. Without any evidence to the contrary, management appears to have unquestionable integrity from a public-filing perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1468328/000095017025026747/adus-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQG9fXCk_BTcJCVaQAqIVcKu3ebZzBMf-b_KooYUccdmFqcGJ8B1rOgXaEvbHFowLgl3OwMOYVqbjz9DGL8f0dsldZWB86N6IIMADRmv228QwveSECvrPH3-dzqqF_56XNX8vztbGdCCzQ_ejaY7lHMtcFoVnETcwVHNebdtIGxs3YdIJ_vKf6ghWcnr7ftP6BlxwDzwRsx_GNYMauuwl0-SgETT) (August 5, 2025)

### Synthesis
Addus HomeCare scores well on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong position in a growing industry, a clear strategy centered on M&A and partnership with managed care organizations, and a stable, transparent management team. The company's strongest positives are its long runway for growth driven by demographic tailwinds and its disciplined execution of an acquisition-led strategy that builds market density. The primary negatives stem from a lack of clear metrics on R&D effectiveness, the inherent risks of a highly unionized workforce, and the demonstrated willingness to use dilutive equity financing for major acquisitions. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on the successful integration of the large Gentiva acquisition and its impact on margins and organic growth. A "No" on R&D could flip to "Yes" with more specific disclosures on technology investments and their quantifiable impact on operating efficiency. Similarly, the "No" on equity financing risk would only flip if the company can demonstrate the ability to fund its next phase of growth primarily through cash flow and debt without further significant dilution.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
