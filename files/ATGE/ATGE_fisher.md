**Company:** Adtalem Global Education Inc. (ATGE)
**Date of Analysis:** August 23, 2025
**Primary Sources Reviewed:** Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025; Earnings Call Transcripts; Public news and data sources.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adtalem is a leading provider of healthcare education, a sector with significant, durable demand. The U.S. faces a projected shortfall of up to 124,000 physicians by 2033 and needs to hire at least 200,000 nurses annually to meet rising demand. This structural shortage is driven by an aging population and workforce retirements, creating a long-term need for the medical, nursing, and veterinary professionals that Adtalem educates. The company's revenue grew 13.3% for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, reflecting this strong demand.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adtalem's management consistently discusses program expansion and partnerships as key growth drivers in its public communications. The company is focused on expanding its healthcare offerings, both online and at physical campuses, to meet workforce demand. This includes adding new programs and forming partnerships with healthcare systems to create talent pipelines. The growth strategy is centered on leveraging its existing institutional strengths to broaden its reach within the high-demand healthcare sector.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For an education provider, "R&D" translates to curriculum development and investment in educational technology. The company's balance sheet includes $56.1 million in capitalized "Curriculum" intangible assets as of March 31, 2025, which are being amortized over a 5-year life, indicating ongoing investment. However, the company does not provide specific metrics to quantitatively assess the return on these investments, such as the direct impact on student outcomes or enrollment from specific curriculum updates. Without clear output metrics, the effectiveness is hard to gauge against its size.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "sales organization" is its student marketing and recruitment function. Revenue growth of 13.3% for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, was driven by increased enrollment, indicating effective marketing and recruitment strategies. Adtalem successfully leverages its brand recognition, particularly with Chamberlain and Walden, to attract a steady flow of new students in a competitive market. This consistent enrollment growth, which outpaces many peers in the for-profit education sector, demonstrates an above-average ability to attract and retain students.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm) (May 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Adtalem reported an operating margin of 19.9% ($264.6M in operating income on $1,331.2M in revenue). This is a significant improvement from 12.6% in the prior-year period and is competitive within its industry. For comparison, competitor Grand Canyon Education (LOPE) reported an operating margin of 28.2%, while Strategic Education (STRA) was lower at 13.2%. Adtalem's margin demonstrates strong profitability and operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adtalem is actively focused on improving margins through operating leverage and cost management. The significant year-over-year increase in operating margin (from 12.6% to 19.9%) was achieved despite the absence of "business integration expense" from the Walden acquisition, which burdened the prior year. The company also recorded restructuring expenses related to workforce reductions and real estate consolidation, indicating a focus on operational efficiency. Management commentary in earnings calls highlights a commitment to cost discipline and leveraging the scale of its combined operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm) (May 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/ATGE/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/ATGE/transcripts/) (Accessed August 23, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of major or systemic labor disputes, such as strikes or unionization drives, in the company's SEC filings or recent news searches. Adtalem's career-focused website emphasizes its "TEACH" values (Teamwork, Energy, Accountability, Community, Heart) and highlights its culture. While the company has undertaken some workforce reductions as part of restructuring, this appears to be targeted rather than indicative of widespread employee dissatisfaction. In the absence of negative indicators, relations appear stable.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior leadership team demonstrates stability. CEO Steve Beard has been in his role since September 2021 and was named Chairman of the Board in November 2024, indicating the board's confidence in his leadership. The average tenure for the management team is 3.3 years, which is reasonable given the company's transformation following the Walden acquisition. The board of directors is considered experienced, with an average tenure of 6.8 years, providing stable oversight.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adtalem has a well-defined management structure with clear leadership for its key segments and functions. The company's website lists dedicated presidents for Chamberlain University, Walden University, and the Medical and Veterinary schools, in addition to a full suite of C-level executives for functions like finance, marketing, and HR. This structure suggests a deep bench of experienced leaders responsible for day-to-day operations and strategy within their respective domains, mitigating key-person risk at the CEO level.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Adtalem provides detailed segment-level financial data, allowing for clear analysis of revenue and profitability drivers. However, the company disclosed in its Q3 2025 10-Q that it had identified an error in the presentation of capitalized cloud computing costs in prior financial statements. While Adtalem concluded the error was not material and revised the statements, the existence of such an error indicates a weakness in accounting controls, preventing a "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In for-profit healthcare education, student outcomes, particularly licensure exam pass rates, are a critical indicator of quality and a key competitive advantage. For calendar year 2024, Chamberlain University's national average NCLEX first-time pass rate for its BSN program was 79.40%. While this is a key metric, it falls below the 2023 national average for bachelor's degree graduates of 90.17%. Although other programs like the PMHNP show pass rates above the national average, the flagship BSN program's performance is not outstanding relative to the national benchmark.
**Answer:** No

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management balances near-term profitability with long-term investment. The company's cash flow is allocated across debt repayment, significant share repurchases ($146.4 million in the nine months ended March 31, 2025), and capital expenditures ($31.3 million). While the large buyback program could be viewed as prioritizing short-term shareholder returns, it is balanced with investments and a clear strategy to capitalize on the long-term demand for healthcare professionals. Management consistently communicates this long-range vision in its earnings calls.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong. It generated $278.2 million in cash flow from operations in the first nine months of fiscal 2025. This cash flow comfortably funded capital expenditures, significant debt reduction ($109.9 million), and a large share repurchase program ($146.4 million). With a solid balance sheet and robust internal cash generation, there is virtually no risk of dilutive equity financing in the foreseeable future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm) (May 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a regular cadence of communication through earnings calls and investor presentations. The company was transparent about the accounting error and revision in its 10-Q filing, explaining the issue and its (non-material) impact. When a short-seller report was issued in January 2024, the company responded and continued its regular disclosures, addressing risks and challenges in its subsequent filings and calls. This demonstrates a willingness to communicate through both positive and negative events.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/730464/000155837025006986/atge-20250331x10q.htm) (May 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The for-profit education sector operates under high regulatory scrutiny and litigation risk. In January 2024, a short-seller report from Safkhet Capital alleged "aggressive and sometimes deceptive tactics" in Adtalem's business model, which spurred multiple law firms to announce investigations on behalf of investors. While an investigation is not proof of wrongdoing, the serious nature of these allegations, combined with the inherent regulatory risks of the industry, means integrity cannot be considered "unquestionable" at this time.
**Answer:** No

---
**Synthesis:**
Adtalem's strength lies in its strategic position as a scaled provider of healthcare education in a market with severe and lasting labor shortages. This gives the company a long runway for growth, which it is capturing effectively, as shown by strong revenue growth and improving profit margins. The company's financial discipline is excellent, with robust cash flow funding both debt reduction and significant shareholder returns without any need for dilution. However, the investment case carries notable risks. The "No" answers highlight key challenges: questions around management's integrity stemming from a short-seller report and subsequent investor lawsuit investigations, subpar NCLEX pass rates for its core nursing program relative to the national average, and a recent accounting error. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on two factors: the resolution of the investor lawsuits and regulatory scrutiny, and a demonstrable improvement in Chamberlain's BSN NCLEX pass rates to exceed the national average. Positive outcomes on these fronts would flip points 15 and 11 to "Yes" and materially de-risk the company's profile.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
