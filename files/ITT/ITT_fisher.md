ITT Inc., August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed for fiscal year 2024, Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, and various reputable news and financial data sources.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ITT operates in diversified and growing end markets, including transportation, industrial, and energy. The company is strategically positioning itself to benefit from long-term secular trends such as the energy transition, as evidenced by its January 2024 acquisition of Svanehøj, a supplier of pumps for cryogenic applications in the marine sector. The Q2 2025 earnings call highlighted strong order intake, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 and a backlog of nearly $2 billion, up 34% year-over-year, indicating strong future demand. Management raised its full-year 2025 revenue growth guidance to a range of 5% to 7%, reinforcing confidence in sustained growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ITT demonstrates a strong commitment to ongoing development through both organic and inorganic investments. The company consistently invests approximately 3.2% of its revenue in R&D annually, focusing on innovation in areas like brake pad formulations for electric vehicles and energy-efficient motor technology. Furthermore, ITT actively reshapes its portfolio through strategic M&A, acquiring kSARIA in September 2024 to bolster its aerospace and defense offerings and Svanehøj in January 2024 for the cryogenic pump market. These actions show a clear strategy of investing in high-growth, long-lifecycle platforms.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ITT's R&D spending as a percentage of sales was 3.2% in 2024. This is comparable to, or slightly below, some direct competitors like Graco, which spends around 4.1-4.5% of sales on R&D. However, the output appears effective, as ITT is a leader in developing new brake pad formulations for EVs and has won multiple hybrid and EV platform awards. The continued introduction of new products and technologies, such as the Embedded Motor Drive (EMD), which is now in customer trials, demonstrates a productive R&D function that translates spending into commercially viable innovations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHQXYL6G192FQP0itoq6dogI0OJ5KIZQYdmDGpJJsnjIDS4Rl4_YESAPxShHe-IOrvSP_bIn1_NDitxgpECdReNvHI4ndVLQMCfi5A6KViCPrhBkqOpLXqaDBHucMr7h5uTcHa5 (December 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Evidence points to a strong and effective sales organization. In Q2 2025, ITT delivered $1 billion in orders, up 16% on a total basis and 13% organically, with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1. This resulted in a record ending backlog of nearly $2 billion. The company has well-established, long-term relationships with major OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers, such as its largest customer, Continental. Sales to distributors represent a significant portion of revenue in the CCT (30%) and IP (33%) segments, indicating a robust and diverse channel strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEflGYCLe3KnnC5RW2cmeg0XRrTPoxxucVVJ46ZNOmfJqBDGlectry4ZxPvuE3q69WZIJqFn5E6cCUfLe05AboTXAZgq-DOAVDhI4HCppKouRU4hVuVLGyWhPs4TmFThCHpUDSbTCBw1JchHsujIx7LRq9O5TanjTiW3VugtppLfVxiw1Tfng42LX29Ht-jZbsJo5sj3EvxKqzMFod6uSoz-DO5p65f3o_An7ILJm1LNVjNNX7EXgZd30Cfu3IA (August 1, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ITT maintains strong profit margins. For the full year 2024, the company-wide operating margin was 18.6%. In the second quarter of 2025, the company reported an operating margin of 18.4%. These margins are healthy, though they trail some top-tier industrial peers like Graco (26-28%) and Parker-Hannifin (20%+). However, they are significantly better than other competitors like Flowserve (around 10-12%). The company is also showing consistent margin expansion, with the Q2 2025 operating margin expanding over 100 basis points when excluding recent M&A impacts.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin expansion through multiple levers. The 2024 10-K states the company has been able to mitigate the impact of inflation via fixed-price supply contracts, price increases to customers, and productivity savings. The Q2 2025 earnings call reinforces this, noting that margin expansion was driven by "operational improvements, productivity, and strategic pricing actions." These efforts are delivering results, with operating income growing more than twice the rate of organic sales in Q2 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH5_KQx9_OO3M-dE69n694ibi4M65C9TMSFsqnzdZLVS2gtLH9DSW6FaosL3FvwumFIYDUonpwqsLrUaPi1cJn2fiVYAJBineIX3uH1YC2hh7i48tW3nDvnmh9cee_jrIn7QNq2yRaChNuhOcrky0_jsSCcipbgwtFDxobZruYJP7P2g8oLtvRnXJ7x3UVPy8S--WplKKnJY2RFw58oGEefeGd7Omjg_hNCZ91rztIvjEAo (July 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEflGYCLe3KnnC5RW2cmeg0XRrTPoxxucVVJ46ZNOmfJqBDGlectry4ZxPvuE3q69WZIJqFn5E6cCUfLe05AboTXAZgq-DOAVDhI4HCppKouRU4hVuVLGyWhPs4TmFThCHpUDSbTCBw1JchHsujIx7LRq9O5TanjTiW3VugtppLfVxiw1Tfng42LX29Ht-jZbsJo5sj3EvxKqzMFod6uSoz-DO5p65f3o_An7ILJm1LNVjNNX7EXgZd30Cfu3IA (August 1, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company reports a stable relationship with its workforce. As of December 31, 2024, ITT had approximately 11,700 employees, with about 13% of its U.S. workforce represented by unions. The 10-K explicitly states, "We continually focus on building strong relationships with our employees and we have not experienced any material strikes or work stoppages in the past several years." A search for recent labor disputes or widespread issues did not reveal any significant negative events. The company details its commitment to employee health, safety, and development in its "Human Capital Management" section.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable and experienced. CEO Luca Savi has been in his role since January 2019 and previously held COO and segment president roles since 2011, indicating a long tenure and deep knowledge of the company. Other key executives, such as the CFO and segment presidents, also have significant industry and company experience, suggesting a cohesive and seasoned leadership team. There are no public reports of executive infighting or abrupt, high-level departures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ITT's public disclosures indicate strong management depth. The 2024 10-K lists eight senior executives beyond the CEO, including presidents for each of the three operating segments (Motion Technologies, Industrial Process, Connect & Control Technologies) as well as heads of Finance, Legal, HR, and Strategy. This structure ensures dedicated, high-level leadership for each key business area and corporate function, mitigating key-person risk at the CEO level. The practice of promoting from within, as seen with the CEO's career path, further suggests the development of a strong leadership bench.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ITT's accounting and controls appear robust. The 2024 Form 10-K includes a statement from management asserting the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was based on the COSO framework and was audited by their independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, which issued an unqualified opinion. The company provides detailed segment-level financial data, allowing for clear analysis of performance drivers. There is no history of material restatements or serious accounting issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for ITT is its large installed base of products, particularly in the Industrial Process segment, which generates significant, recurring aftermarket revenue. In 2024, aftermarket solutions represented 43% of the IP segment's revenue. This provides a stable, high-margin revenue stream that is less cyclical than new project business. The company's focus on highly engineered, critical components for harsh environments creates strong customer relationships and technological lock-in, as these parts are often designed into long-lifecycle platforms like aircraft and automotive models.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a long-range outlook through its capital allocation strategy. The company is actively investing in long-term growth trends, such as the energy transition and aerospace/defense, through significant acquisitions like Svanehøj and kSARIA, even though these moves incur near-term M&A and amortization costs. Consistent R&D spending of ~3.2% of revenue, even through economic cycles, underscores a focus on future product vitality rather than maximizing short-term profit. The company has set forth financial targets for fiscal year 2029, including an adjusted segment operating margin of 27%, indicating a clear long-term plan.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH5_KQx9_OO3M-dE69n694ibi4M65C9TMSFsqnzdZLVS2gtLH9DSW6FaosL3FvwumFIYDUonpwqsLrUaPi1cJn2fiVYAJBineIX3uH1YC2hh7i48tW3nDvnmh9cee_jrIn7QNq2yRaChNuhOcrky0_jsSCcipbgwtFDxobZruYJP7P2g8oLtvRnXJ7x3UVPy8S--WplKKnJY2RFw58oGEefeGd7Omjg_hNCZ91rztIvjEAo (July 31, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ITT has a strong financial position and has demonstrated a commitment to avoiding shareholder dilution. The company funded its recent large acquisitions of Svanehøj and kSARIA through debt and cash on hand, not by issuing equity. Furthermore, management is actively returning capital to shareholders and reducing the share count. In the first half of 2025, ITT repurchased $500 million of its own shares, lowering the weighted average share count by 3%. This demonstrates both the financial capacity to fund growth and a clear policy of anti-dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/216228/000021622825000014/itt-20241231.htm (February 7, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEguJ064JFhnZYLXPmK3lg68Qxypk5_SdPCf3gtFL848fJQ3laegLDKOo67c7UXpAXnh9z434jpUbRANN_Bo9N3YjMyO05gfUnkb4nxIanjtd9awkq0GlrZZt6IjRJLjP40FrkMUhp8z-bjvOxYF9gswiQr0AirlDiQBgaI-7lXh28PDTm1h1gHQdtOsNkudw== (July 31, 2025), https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEflGYCLe3KnnC5RW2cmeg0XRrTPoxxucVVJ46ZNOmfJqBDGlectry4ZxPvuE3q69WZIJqFn5E6cCUfLe05AboTXAZgq-DOAVDhI4HCppKouRU4hVuVLGyWhPs4TmFThCHpUDSbTCBw1JchHsujIx7LRq9O5TanjTiW3VugtppLfVxiw1Tfng42LX29Ht-jZbsJo5sj3EvxKqzMFod6uSoz-DO5p65f3o_An7ILJm1LNVjNNX7EXgZd30Cfu3IA (August 1, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its communications. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, alongside reporting record revenue, executives openly discussed challenges. They noted headwinds to margin expansion from "temporary M&A amortization and foreign currency transaction costs" and an "unfavorable mix" impacting margin guidance for the year. This willingness to discuss both positive and negative factors in detail suggests a culture of transparency with the investment community.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant integrity issues with the current management of ITT Inc. A search for major lawsuits or regulatory fines revealed cases related to the defunct, and entirely separate, "ITT Educational Services." A violation tracker lists 28 records since 2000 for ITT Inc. with penalties totaling approximately $14 million, the bulk of which relates to a single government contracting issue. Given the company's size and decades of operation, this does not indicate a systemic problem. The company's 10-K details its ethics and compliance programs, and the auditor's report is clean.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis: ITT scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, presenting as a high-quality, well-managed industrial manufacturer. Its strongest attributes are a clear strategy for long-term growth through disciplined R&D and strategic acquisitions in secular growth markets, robust financial controls, and a shareholder-friendly capital allocation policy that favors buybacks over dilutive financing. The company demonstrates consistent operational execution, leading to strong order growth, a record backlog, and expanding margins. The primary variable that could influence the score over the next 12-24 months is the successful integration of its recent large acquisitions, kSARIA and Svanehøj. Evidence to watch would be sustained margin performance in the IP and CCT segments as amortization and integration costs are absorbed, and continued strong order flow from these new businesses to validate the strategic rationale for the purchases.

fisher score is 15 / 15
