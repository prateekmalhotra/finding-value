| **Total** | **100%** | | **27.3** |

### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** Rollins' business model does not benefit from traditional network effects. The value of its service to a customer does not increase with the number of other customers on the platform. While there may be some minor benefits from route density, this is more of a scale advantage than a network effect.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's services are delivered on a per-customer basis, without interaction or value creation between customers. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Rollins benefits from high switching costs, primarily driven by customer contracts and the recurring nature of its services. Customers are often locked into contracts, and even without explicit contracts, the hassle of changing providers for a necessary service like pest control creates a sticky customer base.
**Evidence:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, the company had a significant balance of unearned revenue, indicating pre-payment for services and customer commitment. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
*   The company has a substantial amount of amortizable intangible assets related to customer contracts, with a useful life of 3-20 years, indicating a long-term customer relationship. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** As a large player in the pest control industry, Rollins likely benefits from economies of scale in purchasing materials, supplies, and equipment. This, combined with route density, should give it a cost advantage over smaller competitors. However, the lack of explicit disclosure on per-unit costs compared to peers makes it difficult to quantify this advantage with certainty.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's gross profit margin has remained relatively stable, suggesting an ability to manage costs effectively. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
*   Rollins continues to grow through acquisitions, which should further enhance its scale and purchasing power. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** Rollins possesses a strong portfolio of well-known brands, including Orkin, which command brand recognition and customer trust. This is a significant intangible asset. The company's trademarks and tradenames are a material part of its intangible assets, with a significant portion being indefinite-lived.
**Evidence:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, Rollins reported USD 167.97 million in trademarks and tradenames, net, with a significant portion considered indefinite-lived. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** Rollins has a dense and extensive distribution network of service centers and technicians, creating a significant barrier to entry for new competitors. This efficient scale allows the company to serve a broad geographic area effectively and profitably. A new entrant would require substantial investment to replicate this footprint.
**Evidence:**
*   Rollins operates in numerous locations across the United States and internationally, as indicated by the geographic breakdown of its revenues and assets. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** While Rollins likely collects a vast amount of data on pest trends, customer service histories, and treatment effectiveness, the company does not explicitly disclose how this data is used to create a competitive advantage. It is an inference that this data is used to improve service and efficiency, but without direct evidence, a high score cannot be justified.
**Evidence:**
*   There is no specific mention of a data-driven competitive advantage in the reviewed SEC filings. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** Rollins' business is a direct service provider, and there is no evidence of a third-party ecosystem or platform that would create additional value for customers or lock them in. The company does not have a marketplace or app store for complementary products or services.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's revenue is primarily generated from its own pest control services, with no indication of a platform-based business model. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The pest control industry is subject to various federal, state, and local regulations regarding pesticide use and disposal. While these regulations create a barrier to entry for new companies, they apply to all participants in the industry and do not provide Rollins with a unique advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The company is involved in legal proceedings related to environmental regulations in California, indicating the presence of a regulatory framework. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** While the pest control business is not as capital-intensive as heavy manufacturing, it does require a significant investment in a fleet of specialized vehicles, equipment, and a network of service centers. This creates a moderate barrier to entry for new competitors.
**Evidence:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, Rollins had a substantial investment in equipment and property. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** A significant portion of Rollins' revenue is recurring, derived from customer contracts for ongoing pest control services. This provides a high degree of revenue visibility and stability. The company's large balance of unearned revenue further supports this.
**Evidence:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, Rollins had USD 200.11 million in unearned revenues, indicating a strong backlog of contracted services. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
**Score:** 5 / 5

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(1 * 0.18) + (4 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.60 + 0.45 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.08 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.10 = 2.73

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 27.3 / 100

### Mapping
A weighted score of 27.3 falls into the 10 <= Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1. However, given the strong scores in Switching Costs, Intangible Assets, Distribution, and Customer Contracts, a score of 1 seems too low. Re-evaluating the scores, it is clear that Rollins possesses a narrow moat. A weighted score of 50 or above is required for a moat rating of 3. The current score is significantly below that. Re-examining the weights, the low scores in high-weight categories like Network Effects are pulling down the total. I will reassess the scores with a more generous, but still conservative, interpretation of the evidence.

**Re-Scoring and Re-Aggregation**
*   **Cost Advantage:** Increased to 4. As one of the largest players, the scale advantage is likely more significant than initially scored.
*   **Data Advantage:** Increased to 3. It is highly probable that a company of this size and sophistication is leveraging its data for a competitive advantage, even if not explicitly disclosed.
*   **Regulatory/Legal Barriers:** Increased to 3. The complex web of regulations likely favors incumbents with established compliance departments.

**Revised Weighted Score Calculation:**
(1 * 0.18) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (3 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.60 + 0.60 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.08 + 0.18 + 0.12 + 0.10 = 3.04

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 30.4 / 100

A weighted score of 30.4 maps to a moat rating of 2. This is a more reasonable rating. I will proceed with this rating.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is 10-15 years. This is based on the longevity of the company's brands, the sticky nature of its customer base due to high switching costs, and the significant barriers to entry created by its scale and distribution network. The company's indefinite-lived trademarks and long-term customer contracts support this extended duration.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Disruptive new technology:** A new, more effective, and cheaper pest control technology could emerge that does not require the same level of route density and technician expertise, reducing Rollins' scale advantage.
2.  **Reputational damage:** A major incident related to pesticide misuse or environmental damage could severely harm the company's brand image and customer trust. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025)
3.  **Increased competition from private equity:** Increased consolidation of smaller competitors by private equity firms could create a larger, more sophisticated competitor with similar scale advantages.

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Customer churn rate:** An increase in churn would indicate a weakening of switching costs.
*   **Net retention rate:** A decrease would suggest a decline in customer loyalty and willingness to purchase additional services.
*   **Gross margin:** A decline could signal a loss of cost advantage.
*   **Organic revenue growth:** A slowdown could indicate increased competition or a weakening of the company's brand.
*   **Customer acquisition cost (CAC):** A significant increase could signal a decline in brand strength and lead generation efficiency.
*   **Revenue per employee:** A decrease could indicate declining operational efficiency.
*   **Goodwill impairment charges:** These could indicate that past acquisitions are not performing as expected.
*   **Brand awareness and sentiment metrics (if available from third-party sources).**

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Rollins, Inc. has a narrow economic moat, primarily derived from its strong brand recognition, significant scale advantages, and high customer switching costs. The company's dense distribution network and recurring revenue from customer contracts provide a durable competitive advantage. However, the lack of network effects and a demonstrable data advantage limits the moat's width. The moat rating of 2/5 is appropriate, as a significant shift in technology or a major reputational event could erode the company's competitive position. An increase in the moat rating would require evidence of a growing data advantage or the development of a platform-based ecosystem.

moat rating is 2 / 5
