**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the market's implied assumptions, we solve for the 5-year revenue growth rate that equates the DCF output to the current market price of $308.17.

*   **Preliminary WACC (for Reverse DCF):** 8.35% (See Part 2, Section E for detailed calculation).
*   **TTM Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF):** $12,840 EBIT * (1 - 21.0% Tax Rate) + $1,725 D&A - $509 SBC - $2,003 Capex - $3,783 Change in WC = **$5,574 Million**.
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5% (Assumed, reflecting long-term inflation).

To justify the market capitalization of **$216,027 Million** ($308.17 price * 701M shares), the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 11.5%**, assuming the TTM operating margin of 20.2% remains constant.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the current stock price of $308.17, one has to believe American Express can grow its revenue by approximately **11.5% annually for the next five years** while maintaining its current operating margin of **20.2%**.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Conservative Base-Case)**

**C) FORMULATE CONSERVATIVE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Rationale:** The market's implied 11.5% growth is optimistic relative to the most recent TTM revenue growth of 9.17%. While the company has shown strong performance, a more conservative forecast is prudent given macroeconomic uncertainties and the law of large numbers.

7.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1–5):**
    *   **Assumption:** I will use a **9.0%** growth rate for Year 1, tapering down by 100 basis points annually to a terminal rate of 5.0% in Year 5.
    *   **Justification:** This is aligned with the most recent TTM growth of 9.17% (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025) and is more conservative than the market's implied 11.5%. This tapering reflects the difficulty of maintaining high growth on an increasingly large revenue base.

8.  **Operating Margin:**
    *   **Assumption:** A stable operating margin of **20.0%** throughout the forecast period.
    *   **Justification:** This is slightly below the TTM margin of 20.2% and aligns closely with the FY 2024 margin of 20.3% (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025). Without specific management guidance on significant margin expansion initiatives, assuming a stable, slightly conservative margin is realistic.

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Assumption:** An effective tax rate of **21.0%**.
    *   **Justification:** This is based on the TTM effective tax rate of 21.0% (StockAnalysis, Aug 22, 2025). The most recent quarter was lower (18.7%), but using the slightly higher trailing average normalizes for any one-time benefits.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed to be **3.2% of revenue**, consistent with the TTM Capex/Revenue ratio ($2,003M / $63,435M).
    *   **Working Capital:** Change in Working Capital is modeled at **6.0% of incremental revenue**, reflecting the historical TTM relationship ($3,783M Change in WC / ($63,435M TTM Revenue - $58,141M Prior TTM Revenue)).

11. **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** Treated as a cash expense. Assumed to be **0.8% of revenue**, consistent with the TTM SBC/Revenue ratio ($509M / $63,435M).
    *   **Share Count:** The latest diluted weighted-average share count of **701 million** will be used for the final per-share calculation (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025, p. 38).

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. **Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital
13. **Rationale:** FCFF is used because it represents the cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of the company's capital structure, making it suitable for enterprise-level valuation.

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $69,144 | $74,676 | $80,650 | $87,102 | $93,199 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *9.0%* | *8.0%* | *8.0%* | *8.0%* | *7.0%* |
| EBIT (20.0% Margin) | $13,829 | $14,935 | $16,130 | $17,420 | $18,640 |
| Tax on EBIT (21.0%) | ($2,904) | ($3,136) | ($3,387) | ($3,658) | ($3,914) |
| **NOPAT** | **$10,925** | **$11,799** | **$12,743** | **$13,762** | **$14,725** |
| D&A (2.7% of Rev) | $1,867 | $2,016 | $2,177 | $2,352 | $2,516 |
| SBC (0.8% of Rev) | ($553) | ($597) | ($645) | ($697) | ($746) |
| Capex (3.2% of Rev) | ($2,213) | ($2,390) | ($2,581) | ($2,787) | ($2,982) |
| Change in WC (6.0% of Incr. Rev) | ($343) | ($332) | ($358) | ($387) | ($366) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$9,683** | **$10,496** | **$11,335** | **$12,242** | **$13,148** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.33%** (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**. This is a standard, widely-used premium for a mature market like the United States.
    *   **Beta (β):** **1.29** (FINVIZ, 5-Year Beta). This beta is greater than 1, reflecting that AXP's stock is historically more volatile than the overall market, which is reasonable for a company whose performance is sensitive to consumer spending and the economic cycle.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.33% + 1.29 * 5.0% = 10.78%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Calculation:** TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $8,225M / $60,723M = 13.5%. This is very high due to the nature of AXP's funding structure. A more appropriate measure is the yield on its long-term debt. A recent issuance had a weighted average coupon of 5.13% (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025, p. 23). Using this as a proxy for the current cost of debt.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.13% * (1 - 21.0%) = 4.05%**

16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity:** $216,027 Million
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** $60,723 Million
    *   **WACC = (E / (E+D)) * CoE + (D / (E+D)) * CoD * (1-t)**
    *   **WACC = (216,027 / 276,750) * 10.78% + (60,723 / 276,750) * 4.05% = 8.41% + 0.89% = 8.35%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This rate is a conservative estimate for long-term sustainable growth, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF_yr5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($13,148 * 1.025) / (8.35% - 2.5%) = $230,488 Million**

18. **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA ≈** $18,640 (EBIT) + $2,516 (D&A) = $21,156 Million
    *   A search reveals historical EV/EBITDA multiples for AXP have been in the 10x-15x range. A conservative 11.0x exit multiple is appropriate.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $21,156M * 11.0 = $232,716 Million**
    *   The two methods yield very similar results, providing confidence in the terminal value assumption.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($9,683/1.0835¹) + ... + ($13,148/1.0835⁵) = **$46,031 Million**
    *   **PV of Terminal Value:** $230,488 / (1.0835⁵) = **$154,166 Million**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $46,031M + $154,166M = $200,197 Million**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   **Net Debt:** $60,723M (Total Debt) - $57,739M (Cash) = $2,984 Million
    *   **Equity Value = $200,197M - $2,984M = $197,213 Million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Fair Value per Share = $197,213M / 701M shares = $281.33**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$281.33**.
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($225):** Assumes lower revenue growth (tapering from 7% to 4%) and margin compression to 19.0%, resulting in a value of approximately $225 per share.
    *   **High/Bull Case ($345):** Assumes higher revenue growth (matching the market-implied 11.5% tapering to 7%) and modest margin expansion to 21.0%, resulting in a value of approximately $345 per share.

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **MOS Price (30% below Base Case) = $281.33 * (1 - 0.30) = $196.93**

### **Risk Notes**

The base-case valuation is subject to several key risks: 1) **Consumer Spending Downturn:** AXP's revenue is highly correlated with consumer and business spending. A significant economic slowdown would directly impact transaction volumes and revenues. 2) **Credit Performance:** While currently strong, a rise in unemployment could lead to higher credit losses than forecasted, impairing earnings. 3) **Competitive & Regulatory Pressure:** The payments industry is intensely competitive. Increased pressure on merchant discount rates or new regulations (e.g., related to surcharging or interchange fees) could compress margins. 4) **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** The company's net interest income is sensitive to changes in benchmark rates, which could affect lending profitability.

final answer is 281.33 $
