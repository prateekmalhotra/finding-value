The following guidance was extracted from the company's Q2 2025 earnings release on August 7, 2025.

*   **Full Year 2025 Net Sales Growth:** "Revised to be between 0% and 1%." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Highlights, Aug 8, 2025)
*   **Full Year 2025 Adjusted EBITDA:** "Revised to approximately $1.485Bâ€“$1.515B." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Highlights, Aug 8, 2025)

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025): 0.5%**. This uses the midpoint of management's revised guidance of 0-1% for the full year 2025. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Highlights, Aug 8, 2025)
    *   **Years 2-5: 4.0%**. This uses the midpoint of management's long-term organic growth target of 3-5%. (Press Release, Aug 7, 2025)
*   **Operating Margin:**
    *   **10.2% (Stable)**. The TTM operating margin is 10.21%. While management is targeting synergy capture, the recent guidance reduction and operational disruptions suggest a conservative, stable margin is more realistic for a base case. No specific margin expansion targets were provided. (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)
*   **Tax Rate:**
    *   **25% (Normalized)**. The company's recent effective tax rates are not meaningful due to merger-related charges. A normalized rate of 25% is assumed, representing the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% plus an allowance for state taxes.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex: 4.0% of Revenue**. This aligns directly with management's guidance. (Primo Brands Q2 2025 Earnings, Aug 7, 2025)
    *   **Change in Working Capital: 1.4% of Incremental Revenue**. This is based on the TTM ratio of Working Capital ($82.7M) to TTM Revenue ($6,046M). (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Comp:** Forecasted as a stable percentage of revenue, based on the TTM level (0.55% of TTM Revenue).
    *   **Share Count:** The latest reported diluted weighted-average share count of 322.0 million is used for the final per-share calculation. (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Unlevered Free Cash Flow (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of capital structure changes.

**Formula:**
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| ($ Millions) | **Year 1 (2025)** | **Year 2 (2026)** | **Year 3 (2027)** | **Year 4 (2028)** | **Year 5 (2029)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,076 | $6,319 | $6,572 | $6,835 | $7,108 |
| *Growth* | *0.5%* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* | *4.0%* |
| **EBIT** | **$619.8** | **$644.6** | **$670.3** | **$697.1** | **$725.0** |
| *Margin* | *10.2%* | *10.2%* | *10.2%* | *10.2%* | *10.2%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT\*(1-T)) | $464.8 | $483.4 | $502.8 | $522.9 | $543.8 |
| \+ D&A | $457.7 | $476.6 | $495.7 | $515.5 | $536.1 |
| \- Stock-Based Comp | ($33.4) | ($34.8) | ($36.1) | ($37.6) | ($39.1) |
| \- Capex | ($243.0) | ($252.8) | ($262.9) | ($273.4) | ($284.3) |
| \- Change in WC | ($0.4) | ($3.4) | ($3.5) | ($3.7) | ($3.8) |
| **FCFF** | **$645.7** | **$669.0** | **$696.0** | **$723.7** | **$752.7** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
The Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is calculated to discount the future free cash flows.

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.3%**. (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Beta:** **0.74**. This reflects a risk profile less volatile than the overall market, which is justifiable for a consumer staples beverage company. (Source: FINVIZ, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.0%**. A standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.3% + 0.74 * 5.0% = 8.0%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** `Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt`
    *   `$337.5M / $5,726.0M = 5.9%`. (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.9% * (1 - 25%) = 4.4%**

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Formula:** `WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * After-Tax Cost of Debt`
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** $25.06/share * 373.52M shares = $9,361M. (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $5,726M. (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Total Capital (E+D):** $9,361M + $5,726M = $15,087M
    *   **WACC = ($9,361 / $15,087) * 8.0% + ($5,726 / $15,087) * 4.4% = 4.97% + 1.67% = 6.64%**

### **F) Terminal Value**
The Terminal Value is calculated using the Gordon Growth Model, with the growth rate capped at long-run inflation expectations.

*   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. This is a realistic assumption for long-term growth, in line with expected long-run inflation.
*   **Calculation:** `($752.7 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0664 - 0.025) = $771.5 / 0.0414 = $18,635M`

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT ($725.0M) + D&A ($536.1M) = $1,261.1M
    *   **Implied Exit Multiple:** Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA = $18,635M / $1,261.1M = **14.8x**
    *   This multiple is reasonable for a stable, cash-generative consumer staples company. The Gordon Growth value will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** `($645.7/1.0664^1) + ($669.0/1.0664^2) + ($696.0/1.0664^3) + ($723.7/1.0664^4) + ($752.7/1.0664^5) = $605.5 + $588.3 + $572.7 + $558.1 + $544.9 = $2,869.5M`
    *   **PV of Terminal Value:** `$18,635 / (1.0664^5) = $13,506.7M`
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $2,869.5M + $13,506.7M = $16,376.2M**

*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Total Debt + Cash & Equivalents`
    *   **Equity Value = $16,376.2M - $5,726.0M + $412.0M = $11,062.2M** (StockAnalysis, Aug 20, 2025)

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   `$11,062.2M / 322.0M shares = $34.35`
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $34.35**. Assumes 4% long-term growth and stable 10.2% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $27.50**. Assumes a lower long-term growth rate (3.0%) and slight margin compression (9.5% EBIT margin) due to competitive pressures.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $42.00**. Assumes a higher long-term growth rate (5.0%) and modest margin expansion to 11.0% driven by successful synergy realization.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A **30%** discount is applied to the base-case estimate to account for forecast uncertainty and operational risks.
    *   **MOS Price = $34.35 * (1 - 0.30) = $24.05**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Integration Risk:** The company is in the midst of a significant merger integration. The recent lowering of guidance due to "service issues" highlights the execution risk involved in achieving the targeted $200-$300 million in synergies.
2.  **Input Cost Volatility:** As a beverage company, PRMB is exposed to fluctuations in packaging (PET resin, aluminum), water sourcing, and distribution costs, which could pressure margins if not offset by pricing.
3.  **Competitive Pressure:** The bottled water and healthy hydration market is highly competitive, with pressure from both large CPG companies and private label brands, which could limit pricing power and growth.
4.  **Debt Burden:** The company holds a significant amount of debt ($5.7B), and its ability to service this debt depends on generating consistent cash flow. Higher interest rates could increase refinancing costs in the future.
5.  **Consumer Demand Shifts:** While positioned in the "healthy hydration" trend, consumer preferences can shift. A move away from bottled beverages for environmental or other reasons could impact long-term volume growth.

final answer is 34.35 $
