**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lithia is one of the largest automotive retailers in the United States, with a growing presence in the United Kingdom and Canada. The automotive retail market is vast and fragmented, providing significant runway for growth through acquisitions and market share gains. Lithia's expansion into digital retail with its Driveway platform and its focus on the highly profitable used vehicle market further enhance its growth prospects. The company has a stated goal of reaching $50 billion in revenue by 2025, a significant increase from its current levels, which it plans to achieve through a combination of acquisitions and same-store growth.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a retailer, Lithia's R&D is primarily focused on technology and process improvements rather than traditional product development. The company does not disclose specific R&D spending, but its investment in its Driveway platform and other digital initiatives have been significant. The effectiveness of these investments can be seen in the rapid growth of Driveway's revenue and its contribution to the company's overall sales. However, without clear disclosure of R&D spending and a direct comparison to competitors, it is difficult to definitively assess the effectiveness of its efforts relative to its size.
**Answer:** No

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lithia's consistent revenue growth and market share gains are strong indicators of an effective sales organization. The company's focus on customer experience, its omnichannel approach, and its well-trained sales force all contribute to its sales success. Lithia's ability to successfully integrate acquired dealerships and improve their performance is another testament to the strength of its sales and operational capabilities.

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lithia has consistently generated strong profit margins, particularly in its used vehicle and finance and insurance (F&I) segments. The company's focus on these higher-margin businesses has allowed it to maintain profitability even during periods of economic uncertainty. While new vehicle margins can be more cyclical, Lithia's diversified business model and its emphasis on cost control have helped it to maintain a healthy overall profit margin. A review of their recent financial reports shows a gross margin of approximately 18% and a net margin of around 4%, which are respectable for the industry.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lithia emphasizes its "Core Values" and its commitment to employee development.

The company's financial statements are audited by a reputable accounting firm, and it has consistently received unqualified audit opinions.

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lithia's management team has consistently demonstrated a long-term focus. The company's aggressive acquisition strategy, its investments in technology, and its expansion into new markets are all evidence of its willingness to make short-term sacrifices for long-term gain. Management's public statements and its strategic plan both emphasize the importance of sustainable growth and long-term value creation. The company's willingness to invest in its Driveway platform, even though it is not yet profitable, is a clear example of its long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lithia has a strong balance sheet and a proven ability to generate cash flow. The company has a revolving credit facility that provides it with ample liquidity to fund its operations and its acquisition strategy. While Lithia has issued equity in the past to fund large acquisitions, it has done so opportunistically and in a way that has not significantly diluted existing shareholders. The company's strong financial position and its access to debt markets should allow it to continue to fund its growth without resorting to significant equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1023128/000102312825000026/lad-20241231.htm']

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Lithia's management team has a reputation for being transparent and accessible to investors. The company holds regular conference calls and provides detailed financial and operational data in its public filings. Management has been open about the challenges it has faced, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global semiconductor shortage. The company's willingness to provide long-term guidance and to openly discuss its strategic plans is a further sign of its commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

The company's commitment to its "Core Values" and its focus on creating a positive and ethical work environment are further indications of its commitment to integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

---
Synthesis: Lithia Motors scores well on Fisher's checklist, with its primary strengths being its long-term growth potential, experienced management team, and strong financial position. The company's aggressive acquisition strategy and its investment in its Driveway e-commerce platform are key drivers of its future growth. The two areas where the company could improve its score are in providing more transparency around its R&D spending and its labor relations. To turn the "No" on R&D effectiveness to a "Yes," the company would need to disclose its R&D spending and provide more data on the returns it is generating from its technology investments. To change the "No" on labor relations, Lithia would need to provide more data on employee turnover and satisfaction.

fisher score is 13 / 15
