The company has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, rather than issuing new shares.

The company has a code of conduct that all employees are expected to follow, and it has established a compliance and ethics program to ensure that the company operates with integrity.

**Synthesis:**

PepsiCo scores a perfect 15 out of 15 on the Fisher checklist, indicating a high-quality business with strong long-term prospects. The company's strengths lie in its iconic brand portfolio, extensive global distribution network, and commitment to innovation. The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its "pep+" transformation strategy and its ability to navigate the evolving consumer landscape, particularly the growing demand for healthier products. A significant misstep in either of these areas could potentially lead to a "No" on one or more of the checklist points.
