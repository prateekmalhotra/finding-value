Company: Starz Entertainment Corp.
Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Starz Entertainment Corp. Form 10-K filed for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starz operates in the large and growing global streaming market, but faces intense competition. The company's subscriber base has shown recent signs of decline; total North American subscribers were 19.1 million as of June 30, 2025, a sequential decrease of 520,000. While the company has a niche strategy focusing on women and underrepresented audiences, recent results indicate this is not yet translating into sustained growth in the face of larger, more capitalized competitors. The most recent quarterly results show a continued decline in both OTT and linear subscribers.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starz is focused on developing and distributing original programming that resonates with its target demographics. The company's 10-K, dated March 31, 2025, details a content strategy that includes tent-pole franchises like "Outlander" and "Power," and mentions a pipeline of new shows. Recent reports from May 2025 confirm a focus on upcoming releases, such as an "Outlander" prequel and a new "Spartacus" series, as key to attracting subscribers. This demonstrates a clear commitment to refreshing its content library to drive future sales.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGq52kWg1qJoQCU6ASJscsyE26RzZRLXp9ioE5tI--CwrrqOnbDLlG5hYfEarZafCWuNo_kjFmxfGw_aoCh8TdvJLvlrMqzABZCA4ItJzY03eqtXiGp_SFV_ToMEbVoXMEmQj_5kJqM4P-2xBHCpRidd8xfxgGJBbmBCfPCDYxERVuYjhN-QWJ-ms2mPgy7zzpWl4bCFc1BPA2CQlsy7MsXhrFp6w== (May 30, 2025)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starz does not report traditional Research & Development expenses, with its primary investment in innovation being content development and acquisition. One source explicitly states "LTM Research & Development Expenses (R&D) $0.0". While the company is investing in new shows, the effectiveness is questionable given the recent subscriber declines in a highly competitive market. Without clear R&D metrics or a consistent track record of hit-driven growth as a standalone company, it is not possible to assess its R&D effectiveness as being superior.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEDDFf298i9rqA959sQOYsS-nVXlVbL6VtPJQD4Kt1jsYmyp1SULStv99ttx5axBLB_bk-3mwf5I7gapB4mQLByXsNsoK5xOYoUiXk-Scpy-9AKO3aAv1Y3PtYjPgqzAgOn80H2DhmGu6NtMUKj0kOy-g== (August 5, 2025)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starz relies heavily on a few major distributors, with Amazon accounting for 29.7% of revenue in fiscal year 2025. The company's 10-K, dated March 31, 2025, acknowledges that these large distributors have significant leverage, which can impact affiliation agreements. The company has experienced subscriber declines, both in its traditional linear business and, more recently, in its OTT service. This indicates that its sales and distribution efforts are not currently outperforming in a challenging market.
**Answer:** No

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, Starz reported an operating loss of $170.4 million on revenues of $1.37 billion, resulting in a negative operating margin. More recently, for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, the company reported a net loss of $42.5 million and an adjusted OIBDA margin that declined to 10.4% from 16.2% in the prior year's quarter. The company is not currently profitable on a GAAP basis.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFUmk7K3Y2uVSXk9Nh69wwlFWumoBmI2xxy7roFTRtxDMrumxgqicU57PmkIdwSR9h6ABFayMYo0rZqXdSB5S101ZZia25mTDDxBxyOSkSYzaEcIIsrZwRU34-GtEZj52IytnuGoNl5PBJfpF5S2gSQRX6NeKvkzg-NoJBcow0XIHAvPg994BqEbnI75zNBaFmJSK21yzSSMeseeGxglOk= (August 21, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is taking significant steps to improve its cost structure. It has exited several international markets to focus on core, profitable regions and has undertaken a "strategic reassessment of the company's content portfolio," resulting in significant content impairment charges. A May 2025 report states that Starz aims to reduce annual content spending by $100 million by 2026. Additionally, the company has implemented price increases for its streaming service.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGq52kWg1qJoQCU6ASJscsyE26RzZRLXp9ioE5tI--CwrrqOnbDLlG5hYfEarZafCWuNo_kjFmxfGw_aoCh8TdvJLvlrMqzABZCA4ItJzY03eqtXiGp_SFV_ToMEbVoXMEmQj_5kJqM4P-2xBHCpRidd8xfxgGJBbmBCfPCDYxERVuYjhN-QWJ-ms2mPgy7zzpWl4bCFc1BPA2CQlsy7MsXhrFp6w== (May 30, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFN2XbPsZuDPPPtd8FMYjNsJCKYiSxZLo71sTUTBEBRJ9WvYkxE4kc5Y9YP5eTurlhjOwDFD617KtWrslGXCb9j11Ye6A6FvD2hhyTNl-4AfAxOTWpjBxPW50pveDdciOIYpQQSUDOPAf9pKlGir13bEfEumIzbFl6fCP5nJepdV_tlKvJKmAR8Zmxr0-kLh4Un17X4xWPUeFiD4C-2_7wES5NH52Qf3jVcDc0Y9dm7r55JA5g2MIsLQl3SvAiYgeqwOE-mAbHfN9mk_qCca442xtWGXkArrhdmw-ud3_YrKA== (May 29, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K, dated March 31, 2025, describes several employee-focused initiatives, including Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), training and development programs, and community involvement. However, there is no publicly available quantitative data on employee turnover, engagement survey results, or a sufficient volume of employee reviews to make a definitive judgment. The "Risk Factors" section also notes that the business could be adversely affected by labor disputes or union actions.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starz has recently been separated from Lionsgate (May 2025), leading to a new management structure. Jeffrey Hirsch continues to lead the company as CEO, providing some continuity. However, as a newly independent entity, the company is in a transitional period. There is insufficient evidence of a long and stable track record for the current executive team as a cohesive, standalone unit.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Information regarding the depth of management beyond the named executive officers is not detailed in the most recent 10-K filing. As a smaller, newly independent company, there is a risk of being less diversified in its management structure compared to its predecessor. Without further disclosures on succession planning or the breadth of the leadership team, it is not possible to confirm management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 10-K, dated March 31, 2025, Starz acknowledges that as a recently separated company, its "accounting and other management systems and resources... may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements." Furthermore, the company is currently facing a lawsuit from noteholders who claim it breached the indenture governing its 5.5% senior notes due 2029. While Starz believes the claims are without merit, this legal challenge, combined with the risks of establishing new internal controls post-separation, suggests potential weaknesses.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starz's primary competitive distinction is its focused content strategy targeting women and underrepresented audiences with premium, ad-free programming. This positions it as a complementary service rather than a direct competitor to broad-based streaming giants. However, the company operates in a highly competitive industry and has recently been losing subscribers, suggesting this strategy has not yet translated into a durable competitive advantage against much larger and better-capitalized rivals.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGE7OONhE3Ar44Es7WEZj8uq3fBs5_LGrOXaNlTbKKiaggRTSwC9ofPyjL_4tyJbBCcmD37tQczUHLPWzv0KNp9TTUg4eZIGlfbFTWCZMKvFP1DIvVXFSM= (August 14, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is undergoing a significant restructuring that has led to short-term negative financial results, including a $177.4 million charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 for content portfolio reassessments. This, along with exiting unprofitable international markets, demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice immediate profits for long-term stability and a more efficient cost structure. Management is also focused on deleveraging and has a target to reduce its debt-to-EBITDA ratio by 2026.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEn8RQ3A7rh6bEXN5HrwhnYS4lJCmOgFqJs-nQJU7rTmaB8YDwAd2SAtLu1pw6eyvSE2uLIT_BJ7f07QgqktmtaNWWEbRy5tlrwLC8bxXFYPyfS-4Ire5d6Bz8M2FguwTciRvr9-w02IQm7f4MJp4QegFVf5Y02j5j5Y1cEdCf6blQQUVELx2wYUT73ptFWMAxH3KIYpFydSsZFJJC4ADseKtPOx4m1RXMf2Zi1ltYU4eg= (August 15, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFN2XbPsZuDPPPtd8FMYjNsJCKYiSxZLo71sTUTBEBRJ9WvYkxE4kc5Y9YP5eTurlhjOwDFD617KtWrslGXCb9j11Ye6A6FvD2hhyTNl-4AfAxOTWpjBxPW50pveDdciOIYpQQSUDOPAf9pKlGir13bEfEumIzbFl6fCP5nJepdV_tlKvJKmAR8Zmxr0-kLh4Un17X4xWPUeFiD4C-2_7wES5NH52Qf3jVcDc0Y9dm7r55JA5g2MIsLQl3SvAiYgeqwOE-mAbHfN9mk_qCca442xtWGXkArrhdmw-ud3_YrKA== (May 29, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 2025, Starz has a net debt of approximately $615.5 million and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 3.0x. The company has a new $150 million revolving credit facility which was undrawn at the time of the separation from Lionsgate. Management has expressed a focus on deleveraging. While the company is not currently profitable, it is generating positive Adjusted OIBDA and has access to credit markets, suggesting it can fund its near-term needs without resorting to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)], [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEn8RQ3A7rh6bEXN5HrwhnYS4lJCmOgFqJs-nQJU7rTmaB8YDwAd2SAtLu1pw6eyvSE2uLIT_BJ7f07QgqktmtaNWWEbRy5tlrwLC8bxXFYPyfS-4Ire5d6Bz8M2FguwTciRvr9-w02IQm7f4MJp4QegFVf5Y02j5j5Y1cEdCf6blQQUVELx2wYUT73ptFWMAxH3KIYpFydSsZFJJC4ADseKtPOx4m1RXMf2Zi1ltYU4eg= (August 15, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starz is a newly independent public company, so its track record of investor communication is limited. The company's first earnings releases as a standalone entity have been accompanied by press releases and webcasts. The 10-K, dated March 31, 2025, provides a detailed and candid "Risk Factors" section that outlines numerous challenges. However, the provided link to earnings call transcripts shows no available data, which makes it difficult to assess the quality and candor of management's direct communication with analysts.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)], [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/STRZ/transcripts/ (August 23, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses in its 10-K, dated March 31, 2025, that it is being sued by noteholders who allege a breach of the indenture governing certain senior notes. The complaint seeks to have a recent debt exchange transaction declared null and void. While the company states the allegations are "without merit," a legal dispute of this nature with its own debt holders raises questions.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929351/000092935125000038/starz-20250331.htm (March 31, 2025)]

---
Synthesis:
Starz Entertainment Corp. scores low on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its challenging position as a newly independent, sub-scale player in the hyper-competitive streaming industry. The company's strongest positives are its clear strategic actions to improve its cost structure and its willingness to take short-term financial pain for long-term stability. However, these positives are currently outweighed by declining subscriber numbers, a lack of profitability, high leverage, and legal issues. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: subscriber trends and margin improvement. A reversal of the subscriber decline, driven by the success of its upcoming original content slate, would flip the "Products/Services with Long Runway" point to a "Yes." Similarly, if the company's aggressive cost-cutting and restructuring efforts translate into sustained positive GAAP operating margins, the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" point could also turn positive.

fisher score is 4 / 15
