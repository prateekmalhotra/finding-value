### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a REIT, R&D is analogous to investments in technology and property innovation. MAA has been actively installing smart home technology in its units, completing installations in over 96,000 units by the end of 2024. This initiative has resulted in an average effective rent increase of approximately $25 per month per unit. This demonstrates a successful and scalable application of technology to drive revenue growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's "sales organization" is its leasing and property management team. The company's portfolio-wide average physical occupancy was 94.8% for the year ended December 31, 2024, indicating a strong ability to attract and retain tenants. MAA also utilizes technology to enhance its leasing process, including online leasing applications, virtual tours, and self-guided tours, which improve efficiency and customer service.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the provided 10-K does not explicitly state profit margins, it does provide data on revenue and net income. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we can infer a strong margin from the reported financials, though a direct comparison to peers would be necessary for a definitive "Yes". Without readily available peer data in the provided document, it is difficult to definitively assess this point.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA is actively engaged in initiatives to improve margins. The company's property redevelopment program, which focuses on interior unit upgrades, resulted in average rental rate increases of 7.3% above market rates for non-renovated units in 2024. The smart home technology initiative also contributes to margin improvement by increasing rental income. The company's focus on operational efficiencies through technology further supports margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA emphasizes its commitment to a positive work environment, with a focus on inclusion and diversity. As of December 31, 2024, ethnic/cultural minorities represented 54% of the workforce, and females represented 46% of the workforce. The company also offers competitive pay and benefits, as well as training and development programs. Without external data on employee satisfaction or turnover, it is difficult to fully assess this point, but the company's stated focus is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's 2024 10-K describes a recent transformation of its executive team, elevating internal candidates to key leadership positions including CEO, President, and CFO. This suggests a focus on succession planning and internal development, which are signs of healthy executive relations. The company highlights its long-standing succession planning to reduce disruption from departures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has recently promoted several internal candidates to key executive roles, which indicates a strong bench of talent within the organization. The 10-K mentions the elevation of internal candidates to roles such as Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Administrative Officer, Chief Strategy and Analysis Officer, and Chief Technology and Innovation Officer. This suggests that the company has a pipeline of experienced professionals ready to step into leadership positions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's 10-K includes a statement on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting, which is a standard disclosure. The company's auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, has provided an unqualified opinion on the financial statements. The report states that management has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting and concluded that it was effective as of December 31, 2024.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's competitive advantage lies in its diversified portfolio strategy, which includes a mix of markets, submarkets, product types, and price points. This diversification helps to minimize volatility and allows the company to perform well across different economic cycles. The company's significant presence in its major markets also provides a competitive edge, allowing it to be a local expert and offer a variety of options to prospective residents.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA's continuous investment in new developments and property redevelopments, as detailed in its 10-K, indicates a focus on long-term value creation. The company's strategy of diversifying its portfolio also suggests a long-range outlook, as this approach is designed to provide stability and growth over the full economic cycle. These long-term investments may not always maximize short-term profits, but they position the company for sustainable growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MAA targets a total debt, net of cash, to adjusted total assets ratio of 30% to 36%, and as of December 31, 2024, this ratio was 29.0%. The company also targets a net debt to Adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 4.5x to 5.5x, and at the end of 2024, this ratio was 4.0x. This indicates a strong balance sheet and borrowing capacity. While the company may issue new equity to maintain its target debt levels, its current financial position suggests it has flexibility and is not forced into dilutive financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 10-K includes a detailed "Risk Factors" section that discusses a wide range of potential challenges, including unfavorable market conditions, competition, and environmental risks. The company also discloses its involvement in legal proceedings, including antitrust lawsuits. This level of disclosure suggests a willingness to be transparent with investors about potential risks and challenges.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 10-K discloses that MAA is a defendant in lawsuits alleging violations of antitrust laws in connection with the use of revenue management software. While the company is defending itself against these allegations, the existence of such lawsuits raises questions about its business practices. The outcome of these legal proceedings will be a key factor in assessing management's integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912595/000095017025016287/maa-20241231.htm) (February 4, 2025)

### Synthesis

MAA demonstrates strength in its long-term growth strategy, supported by a robust development pipeline, effective use of technology to drive revenue, and a disciplined approach to capital management. The company's diversified portfolio and strong operating metrics are also key positives. The primary risks that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the outcomes of the ongoing antitrust lawsuits and the company's ability to maintain its strong operating performance in the face of potential economic headwinds. A resolution of the legal issues in MAA's favor would likely flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes." Additionally, more detailed information on profit margins compared to peers and employee satisfaction would provide a more complete picture.
