**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast consistently invests in expanding its platform. The company's 2024 10-K outlines a growth strategy centered on investing in and expanding its product platform, including broadening its subscription and financial technology solutions. Recent examples of this include the launch of a food and beverage retail offering and a partnership with American Express to enhance the dining experience and create new revenue streams. This commitment is also reflected in its research and development spending, which totaled $175 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025),,

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Toast's research and development expenses were $175 million, representing approximately 6.1% of its total revenue of $2.89 billion. This level of investment supports a rapid pace of innovation, including the recent launch of its food and beverage retail offering and the Toast Go® 3 handheld device. The company's strategy is to invest in R&D to expand the functionality of its platform and broaden its subscription and financial technology solutions, indicating a focus on tangible outputs that drive growth. The consistent growth in locations and ARR suggests these R&D efforts are effective in creating products that attract and retain customers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast's sales and marketing strategy combines a localized, in-market sales team with a high-volume marketing engine. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by its rapid customer growth, with locations increasing 24% year-over-year to approximately 148,000 as of June 30, 2025. The company has successfully penetrated even dense markets, gaining share in metros with over 30% penetration. Sales and marketing expenses were $274 million for the first six months of 2025, a 23% increase year-over-year, showing continued investment in its go-to-market engine to fuel its growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025),,

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast has demonstrated a significant improvement in profitability. For the second quarter of 2025, the company achieved a gross profit of $392 million, representing a gross margin of 25.3%, up from 23.0% in the same period of 2024. The company also reported positive income from operations of $80 million and net income of $80 million for the quarter, a substantial turnaround from the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA for Q2 2025 was $161 million, an increase from $92 million in Q2 2024, indicating growing operational leverage. While still in a high-growth phase, the recent achievement of GAAP profitability and expanding margins are positive indicators.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on driving efficiency. In February 2024, Toast announced a restructuring plan to promote operating expense efficiency, which included a reduction in force and was completed by the end of fiscal 2024. The company continues to focus on "operational efficiency," incurring minor restructuring costs in Q2 2025 to this end. Furthermore, the company is focused on growing its higher-margin subscription services and financial technology solutions revenue streams. Non-GAAP gross profit from these two segments grew to $464 million in Q2 2025 from $344 million in Q2 2024, demonstrating successful execution on this front.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 10-K, Toast states it has not experienced any work stoppages and considers its employee relations to be strong, citing high employee engagement and satisfaction. The company emphasizes a commitment to diversity, inclusivity, and equity. However, the company executed a significant restructuring and reduction in force in February 2024 to improve operating efficiency. While such actions can negatively impact morale, there is no public evidence of widespread or ongoing labor issues. The evidence is mixed, as restructuring is a significant negative, but there are no other clear indicators of poor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a dual-class stock structure which concentrates voting power with stockholders who held capital stock prior to the IPO, including directors and executive officers. While this aligns the incentives of this group, it limits the influence of public shareholders. Recent reports from August 2025 noted over $14 million in insider share sales by executives including the CEO and CFO during the second quarter of 2025. While some sales are attributed to tax obligations from vested RSUs, the volume of selling raises questions about leadership's long-term confidence. The combination of concentrated control and significant recent insider selling suggests executive relations may not be outstanding from a public shareholder perspective.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025),

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast's leadership team, detailed in its definitive proxy statements and investor relations website, includes experienced executives beyond the CEO in key roles such as President & CFO, Chief Revenue Officer, and Chief People Officer. The company's 2024 10-K notes the importance of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and management as critical to success. The successful execution of its growth strategy, including international expansion and new product launches, suggests a capable and deep management team is in place to handle operational complexity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025, management concluded that the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. There is no history of material weaknesses or financial restatements mentioned in the recent filings. The financial statements provide a reasonable level of detail into revenue and cost drivers.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast's key competitive advantage is its all-in-one, vertically integrated platform purpose-built for restaurants, combining SaaS, hardware, and payment processing. This creates high switching costs and a strong ecosystem lock-in for its customers, who benefit from a single vendor for their entire technology stack. The platform's ability to collect vast amounts of transaction data also provides a competitive edge, enabling data-driven insights for restaurant owners and informing the development of new financial products like Toast Capital. The company's direct, localized sales force is another differentiator in a relationship-driven industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast has historically prioritized growth over short-term profitability, making significant investments in sales, marketing, and R&D to capture market share. This is a common strategy for SaaS platform companies. However, recent results and actions show an increasing focus on profitability. The company achieved GAAP net income of $80 million in Q2 2025, and management has raised its outlook for 2025, suggesting a more balanced approach between growth and profitability. The 2024 restructuring plan was explicitly designed to "promote overall operating expense efficiency," further signaling this balanced focus.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025),

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Toast had a strong liquidity position with $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $508 million in marketable securities. The company generated $302 million in cash from operating activities in the first six months of 2025. This strong cash position and positive operating cash flow suggest the company is well-capitalized to fund its growth initiatives internally. In February 2024, the company announced a $250 million share repurchase program, of which approximately $163 million remained as of June 30, 2025, indicating a focus on returning capital to shareholders rather than seeking dilutive financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Toast management regularly holds earnings calls and provides detailed financial reporting through its SEC filings. The "Risk Factors" section of its 10-K is comprehensive and outlines numerous challenges, including competition, reliance on third parties, and the risks associated with its financial products. However, recent insider selling during Q2 2025, totaling over $14 million, has raised concerns about leadership's confidence, with only partial explanations related to tax obligations being offered publicly. This lack of proactive and complete communication regarding significant insider sales detracts from an assessment of full candor.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025),

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no legal or regulatory actions disclosed in recent SEC filings that would question the integrity of the management team. The company's independent auditor provided an unqualified opinion on its financial statements for the fiscal year 2024. However, the combination of a dual-class share structure that concentrates voting control and significant insider selling could be perceived by public shareholders as management prioritizing its own interests. While not an indication of a lack of integrity, these governance and trading practices prevent an unqualified "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000290/tost-20250630.htm) (August 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1650164/000165016425000072/tost-20241231.htm) (February 26, 2025)

---
Synthesis:
Toast scores well on the operational and strategic aspects of Fisher's checklist, demonstrating a long growth runway, strong product development, an effective sales organization, and a clear path to improving profitability. Its integrated platform provides a significant competitive advantage through high switching costs and ecosystem lock-in. The company's recent achievement of GAAP profitability and strong free cash flow generation have also strengthened its financial position considerably, mitigating dilution risk. The primary areas of concern revolve around softer, governance-related issues. The 2024 restructuring, while financially prudent, raises questions about labor relations. More significantly, the combination of a dual-class share structure and recent, heavy insider selling by top executives could suggest a misalignment with public shareholders, impacting the scores for executive relations, candor, and integrity. The score would most likely improve over the next 12-24 months if the company can demonstrate sustained profitability and positive employee sentiment post-restructuring, and if management provides clearer communication around their stock sales and long-term commitment. A flip from "No" to "Yes" on candor and executive relations would require a significant reduction in the volume of insider sales or a more robust, transparent explanation for them beyond boilerplate tax-related reasons.

fisher score is 11 / 15
