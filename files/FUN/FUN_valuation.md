### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

A search for explicit multi-year guidance for revenue and margins did not yield specific targets. Management commentary from the Q1 2025 earnings call on May 8, 2025, focused on post-merger integration with Cedar Fair, cost optimization, and synergy realization. Lacking specific numerical guidance, a cautious approach using historical performance is warranted.

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | 3.0% annually | Reflects a conservative estimate based on the leisure industry's maturity, potential economic headwinds, and the complexities of a major merger integration. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 9.2% of Revenue | Based on the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) operating margin. This assumes that synergies from the Cedar Fair merger will be offset by integration costs and continued investments in the near term, leading to a stable margin. |
| **Tax Rate** | 21.0% | Standard U.S. federal corporate tax rate. The company's recent effective tax rate has been volatile due to losses. |
| **Capex** | 5.8% of Revenue | Based on the TTM Capex as a percentage of revenue, assuming continued investment in park maintenance and new attractions. |
| **Depreciation & Amortization** | 12.1% of Revenue | Based on the TTM D&A as a percentage of revenue, reflecting the significant asset base of the combined company. |
| **Stock-Based Compensation** | 0.85% of Revenue | In line with the TTM Stock-Based Compensation as a percentage of revenue. |
| **Change in Working Capital** | -7.1% of Revenue | Based on the TTM Change in Working Capital as a percentage of revenue. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**FCFF Formula:** `EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in Millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 3,263 | 3,361 | 3,462 | 3,566 | 3,673 |
| EBIT | 300 | 309 | 318 | 328 | 338 |
| NOPAT | 237 | 244 | 251 | 259 | 267 |
| D&A | 395 | 407 | 419 | 431 | 444 |
| Stock-Based Comp | -28 | -29 | -29 | -30 | -31 |
| Capital Expenditures | -189 | -195 | -201 | -207 | -213 |
| Change in Working Capital | 232 | 239 | 246 | 253 | 261 |
| **FCFF** | **747** | **766** | **786** | **806** | **828** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.10% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (treasury.gov, August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta | 1.88 | A high beta reflects the company's sensitivity to economic cycles and discretionary consumer spending (stockanalysis.com, August 21, 2025). |
| *Cost of Equity (Ke)* | *13.50%* | *4.10% + 1.88 \* 5.0%* |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Cost of Debt (Kd) | 3.94% | Interest Expense / Total Debt (340 / 8,634) (stockanalysis.com, August 21, 2025) |
| *After-Tax Cost of Debt* | *3.11%* | *3.94% \* (1 - 21.0%)* |
| **WACC** | | |
| Market Cap (E) | 2,126M | 83.25M shares \* $25.54/share (stockanalysis.com, August 21, 2025) |
| Debt (D) | 8,634M | (stockanalysis.com, August 21, 2025) |
| *WACC* | *5.35%* | *(2126 / (2126 + 8634)) \* 13.50% + (8634 / (2126 + 8634)) \* 3.11%* |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value Formula:** `(Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Calculation:** `(828 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0535 - 0.025) = 29,800M`
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** A conservative 10x EV/EBITDA multiple is applied to Year 5 EBITDA.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = 338 (EBIT) + 444 (D&A) = 782M
    *   **Terminal Value:** 10 \* 782M = 7,820M
*   **Selected Terminal Value:** The lower value of **$7,820M** from the exit multiple cross-check is chosen for a more conservative valuation.

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Calculation:** `$865M Equity Value / 83.25M Diluted Shares`
    *   **Fair Value:** **$10.39 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case ($5.00):** Assumes lower revenue growth (1%), margin compression, and a lower exit multiple.
    *   **High/Bull Case ($15.00):** Assumes higher revenue growth (5%), margin expansion due to successful merger synergies, and a higher exit multiple.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **MOS Discount:** 30% below Base-Case Fair Value
    *   **MOS Price:** **$7.27**
