**Synthesis:**
Tecnoglass scores well on many of Fisher's 15 points, with its strong market position, vertically integrated business model, and experienced management team being key strengths. The company's commitment to innovation and its focus on long-term growth are also positives. The main areas of concern are the lack of disclosure around R&D spending, the lack of information on labor relations, and past concerns about corporate governance. The score could change in the next 12-24 months based on the company's ability to continue to deliver strong financial results, its success in expanding into new markets, and its ability to address any lingering governance concerns. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for R&D Effectiveness if the company were to provide more detailed disclosure on its R&D spending and innovation pipeline. A "No" on integrity could be flipped to "Yes" with a sustained period of no new governance concerns and proactive improvements.

fisher score is 12 / 15
