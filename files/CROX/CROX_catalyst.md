### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On February 10, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a $1.0 billion increase to the company's share repurchase authorization, bringing the total available for repurchase to approximately $1.3 billion. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, with $551.2 million repurchased in 2024.
*   **Mechanism:** Aggressive share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects and can attract investors.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Crocs repurchases $500 million of its stock over the next 12 months. At an average price of $120/share, this would retire ~4.2 million shares, or ~7.4% of shares outstanding.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Crocs repurchases $800 million of its stock. At an average price of $120/share, this would retire ~6.7 million shares, or ~11.8% of shares outstanding.
    *   **High Scenario:** Crocs repurchases $1.3 billion of its stock. At an average price of $120/share, this would retire ~10.8 million shares, or ~19.2% of shares outstanding.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (5-15%). The base case of an 11.8% reduction in share count could directly translate to a similar increase in EPS, which, if the P/E multiple remains stable, could result in a stock price increase of a similar magnitude.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The company has a history of executing on its buyback authorizations and has a new, large authorization in place.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must continue to generate strong free cash flow to fund the repurchases. The stock price must remain at a level that management deems attractive for buybacks.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports on share repurchases in the 10-Q and 10-K filings. Cash flow from operations.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant downturn in business could reduce cash flow available for buybacks. A rapid increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The large, active buyback program provides a strong support for the stock and a clear path to EPS growth.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** HEYDUDE Brand Turnaround and Growth

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The HEYDUDE brand, acquired in February 2022, has seen a significant revenue decline of 13.2% in 2024. A successful turnaround and return to growth for this brand is a major long-term catalyst.
*   **Mechanism:** A successful turnaround would re-accelerate revenue growth for the overall company. As a higher-growth asset, a revitalized HEYDUDE could command a higher valuation multiple for the consolidated company.
*   **Timing:** August 2026 – August 2030
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** HEYDUDE revenues stabilize and grow at a low single-digit rate.
    *   **Base Scenario:** HEYDUDE revenues return to high single-digit growth.
    *   **High Scenario:** HEYDUDE revenues achieve double-digit growth.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A return to growth for HEYDUDE would significantly alter the market's perception of the acquisition and the company's long-term growth prospects, likely leading to a re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The brand has a strong product and loyal following, but the company needs to execute on its strategy of expanding distribution and brand awareness.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful marketing campaigns and product innovation. Expansion into new retail channels.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly revenue growth for the HEYDUDE brand. Gross and operating margins for the HEYDUDE segment.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Continued brand deterioration and revenue declines. Failure to innovate and attract new customers.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The potential upside is significant, but the turnaround is not yet proven.

**2. Catalyst Title:** International Market Expansion

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Crocs is focused on expanding its presence in six key international markets: China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Western Europe. International sales for the Crocs brand grew from 38.2% of revenue in 2022 to 44.1% in 2024, showing strong momentum.
*   **Mechanism:** Successful expansion into these large and growing markets will drive sustained revenue and earnings growth for the long term. This diversification also reduces the company's reliance on the U.S. market.
*   **Timing:** August 2026 – August 2030
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** International revenue growth slows to the low single digits.
    *   **Base Scenario:** International revenue growth continues in the high single digits.
    *   **High Scenario:** International revenue growth accelerates into the double digits.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-25%). Continued strong international growth will be a key driver of the company's overall growth and will be rewarded by the market.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. The company has a proven track record of successful international expansion and a clear strategy for these key markets.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Building out the necessary infrastructure in these markets. Adapting marketing and product to local tastes.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly revenue growth in the international segment. Store count and e-commerce sales in key international markets.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Economic slowdowns in key international markets. Increased competition from local and international brands.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The international growth story is a key part of the long-term investment thesis for Crocs.

*   **Current Market Cap (approx.):** $7.3 billion (as of June 28, 2024)

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Crocs are predominantly positive. The aggressive share repurchase program provides a significant and immediate tailwind for the stock. While the HEYDUDE brand's performance is a near-term headwind, the market has largely priced this in. The core Crocs brand continues to perform well, and the buyback program should provide a strong floor for the stock and drive EPS growth. The short-term market signal is positive.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **HEYDUDE Brand Collapse:** If the HEYDUDE brand's revenue decline accelerates and the brand is unable to be stabilized, it could lead to a significant write-down of the acquisition cost and a major hit to investor confidence.
2.  **Global Recession:** A deep and prolonged global recession would significantly impact consumer discretionary spending, which would hurt both the Crocs and HEYDUDE brands and limit the company's ability to fund its share repurchase program.
3.  **Fashion Fad Risk:** The core Crocs clog could fall out of fashion, leading to a rapid decline in sales and profitability for the core brand.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

We recommend a "Buy" rating for Crocs, Inc. The combination of a large and active share repurchase program, continued strength in the core Crocs brand, and the potential for a high-impact turnaround of the HEYDUDE brand creates a compelling investment case. We see a conservative upside of 10-20% over the next 12 months, driven primarily by the share buyback. The most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly revenue growth of the HEYDUDE brand.
