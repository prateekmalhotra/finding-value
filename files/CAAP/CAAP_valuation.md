Of course. Here is a revised valuation of Corporación América Airports S.A. (CAAP) with a critical review of the initial analysis and adjustments to key assumptions to better reflect reality.

### Critical Assessment of Initial Valuation

The initial valuation was well-structured but contained several assumptions that were either overly punitive or internally inconsistent, leading to a potentially flawed conclusion.

1.  **Extreme Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):** The calculated WACC of 20.47% is excessively high, even for a company with significant exposure to Argentina. This high rate severely penalizes the present value of future cash flows and is the primary source of distortion in the model. It was driven by a high Beta (1.49) combined with a very large Equity Risk Premium.
2.  **Inconsistent Terminal Value:** The analysis correctly noted that the Gordon Growth Method (GGM) produced an unrealistically low terminal value (implying a 3.6x EBITDA multiple) due to the punitive WACC. While switching to an Exit Multiple was the right decision, the large divergence between the two methods is a major red flag indicating a flawed input, namely the WACC. A well-calibrated model should see these two methods produce reasonably close results.
3.  **Static Assumptions:** The assumptions for revenue growth (flat 7%) and operating margin (flat 22.44%) were conservative but lacked nuance. A more realistic model would consider potential operating leverage as traffic recovers and grows, and a growth trajectory that might evolve over the five-year forecast period.

### Revised and Corrected Valuation

The following valuation corrects these issues by moderating the WACC to a more realistic (though still risk-adjusted) level, refining growth and margin assumptions, and ensuring the terminal value is robust and internally consistent.

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current market price of $21.66, the market is implying a 5-year revenue growth rate of approximately **10%** and a stable operating margin of **22.44%**.

This is based on the following assumptions:
*   WACC of 13.52% (calculation in Part 2)
*   Terminal growth rate of 2.5%

### Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Revenue Growth:** A tapered growth rate is more realistic. We'll model **8%** growth for the next two years, reflecting continued travel recovery, followed by **7%**, **6%**, and **6%** as the business matures.
7.  **Margin Path:** As revenue grows, operating leverage should allow for modest margin expansion. The operating margin is projected to gradually increase from the current **22.44%** to **23.50%** by Year 5.
8.  **Taxes:** The TTM effective tax rate is abnormally high. A normalized rate of **35%** is a more reasonable long-term assumption for a company with operations in multiple tax jurisdictions.
9.  **Capital Intensity:**
    *   Capex: Modeled at the 3-year average of **0.74% of revenue** to better reflect recent trends.
    *   Working Capital: Modeled at the historical average of **6.26% of incremental revenue**.
10. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:** SBC is treated as a real cash cost. The diluted share count is held constant at **161.29 million**, assuming buybacks are offset by dilution from SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

FCFF = EBIT * (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $2,023 | $2,185 | $2,338 | $2,478 | $2,627 |
| EBIT | $456.28 | $496.94 | $534.93 | $567.43 | $617.28 |
| FCFF | **$397.64** | **$432.22** | **$463.30** | **$489.28** | **$544.75** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

11. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):** The initial Beta of 1.49 is an outlier. A more normalized Beta of **1.25** is used, which is more in line with global airport operators while still accounting for higher volatility. The Equity Risk Premium remains high to reflect Argentinian risk.
    *   Risk-Free Rate: 4.26% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, August 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: 14.17% (5.5% U.S. premium + 8.67% Argentina country risk premium)
    *   Beta: 1.25
    *   Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.25 * 14.17% = **21.97%**
12. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = 98.70 / 1150 = **8.58%**
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 8.58% * (1 - 0.35) = **5.58%**
13. **WACC:**
    *   Market Cap = $21.66 * 161.29M = $3,494M
    *   WACC = (3494 / (3494 + 1150)) * 21.97% + (1150 / (3494 + 1150)) * 5.58% = **17.90%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

14. **Gordon Growth Method Cross-Check:**
    *   Terminal FCFF = $544.75 * (1 + 0.025) = $558.37M
    *   Terminal Value (GGM) = $558.37 / (0.1790 - 0.025) = **$3,625.78M**
15. **Exit Multiple Method (Primary Method):** A multiple of **9.0x EV/EBITDA** is more appropriate, reflecting the long-term, infrastructure-like nature of airport assets and aligning with peer valuations in more stable markets, discounted slightly for emerging market risk.
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = $617.28 (EBIT) + $223.57 (D&A) = $840.85M
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $840.85M * 9.0 = **$7,567.65M**
    *   *Analyst Note:* The GGM implies an EV/EBITDA multiple of 4.3x ($3,625.78M / $840.85M), which is still too low. The high country risk premium continues to make the GGM formula less reliable than a market-based exit multiple. Therefore, the Exit Multiple approach will be used for the final valuation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

16. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of FCFF = $337.27 + $308.83 + $282.88 + $256.63 + $240.24 = **$1,425.85M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $7,567.65M / (1 + 0.1790)^5 = **$3,337.89M**
    *   Enterprise Value = $1,425.85M + $3,337.89M = **$4,763.74M**
17. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = $1,150M (Total Debt) - $496.81M (Cash) = $653.19M
    *   Equity Value = $4,763.74M - $653.19M = **$4,110.55M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

18. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   $4,110.55M / 161.29M shares = **$25.48**
19. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** $25.48
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** $19 (Lower growth and significant margin compression due to economic crisis)
    *   **High/Bull Case:** $32 (Higher growth and stronger margin expansion as Argentina stabilizes)
20. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):**
    *   $25.48 * (1 - 0.30) = **$17.84**

### Risk Notes

*   **Political and Economic Risk in Argentina:** The company's largest market is subject to significant political and economic volatility, which could impact passenger traffic and profitability. The high WACC is a direct reflection of this risk.
*   **Regulatory Risk:** The company operates under concessions from various governments. Changes in the terms of these concessions could adversely affect financial results.
*   **Currency Fluctuation Risk:** The company is exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the currencies of the countries in which it operates.
*   **Competition:** The company faces competition from other airport operators and other modes of transportation.
*   **Debt:** The company has a significant amount of debt, which could make it vulnerable to an economic downturn.

final answer is 25.48 $
