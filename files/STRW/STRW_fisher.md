Company: Strawberry Fields REIT, Inc. (STRW)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K filed March 13, 2025 (for FY ended Dec 31, 2024), Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript dated May 11, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Strawberry Fields REIT is positioned in the skilled nursing and post-acute healthcare real estate sector, which has strong demographic tailwinds. The U.S. Census projects the population segment over age 65 will nearly double between 2020 and 2060. Concurrently, U.S. nursing home care expenditures are projected to grow from approximately $196.8 billion in 2020 to $266 billion by 2028, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The company operates in a highly fragmented industry with supply constraints, including Certificate of Need (CON) laws in most of its operating states, which provides significant consolidation and growth opportunities.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's growth strategy is centered on property acquisitions, the REIT equivalent of new product development. Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to this strategy, acquiring 23 new facilities for a total cost of $154.3 million between January 1, 2024, and March 13, 2025. This follows a history of significant growth, with 59 properties purchased for approximately $414.0 million since January 2019. This consistent and aggressive acquisition activity clearly indicates a determination to expand its portfolio and revenue base.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a REIT, R&D effectiveness is measured by the quality and return on its investments. Since 2019, the company's acquisitions have achieved a weighted average lease yield of 15.6%, a strong return in the net-lease space. This effective capital deployment has driven an approximate 13.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in the company's aggregate annualized average base rent from 2019 through March 2025. These metrics demonstrate highly effective "R&D" (i.e., acquisition strategy) that generates significant growth in revenue and cash flow.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's "sales" function is its ability to lease properties and manage tenant relationships. As of March 13, 2025, the company's portfolio was 100% leased, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 7.2 years. Approximately 87.7% of its properties are under master leases with cross-default provisions, providing significant security and stability to its rental income stream. These strong portfolio metrics indicate a highly effective leasing and tenant management operation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Strawberry Fields generated Funds From Operations (FFO) of $60.2 million on rental revenues of $117.1 million, resulting in an FFO margin of approximately 51.4%. The company's Net Income was $26.5 million, for a net margin of 22.6%. An FFO margin above 50% is generally considered strong for a REIT and indicates a profitable operation after accounting for the specific nature of real estate accounting.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary strategy for maintaining and improving margins is its use of triple-net leases, which transfer the responsibility for property operating expenses (taxes, insurance, maintenance) to the tenants. Most leases also include annual rent escalators of 1-3%, ensuring a predictable organic growth in revenue. Furthermore, the company actively seeks accretive acquisitions, targeting high initial lease yields, which directly contributes to margin expansion at the portfolio level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is a small, self-managed REIT with only 9 full-time employees as of December 31, 2024. The 10-K states that employees are not part of any union and that relations are considered "satisfactory." The disclosure on human capital is brief and generic, providing no specific metrics on attrition, engagement, or benefits that would support a conclusion of "outstanding" labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team is small and appears stable, led by the CEO and Chairman, Moishe Gubin. A significant feature is the deep operational and financial integration between the company and its largest tenant operator, Infinity Healthcare, which is beneficially owned by the CEO and another director, Michael Blisko. While this creates potential conflicts of interest, it also implies an extremely close and aligned working relationship at the highest level, fostering stability and unique market insight.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company identifies a three-person senior management team: CEO, CFO, and CIO. The 10-K emphasizes their combined experience but provides little detail on broader management depth. The entire company consists of only 9 employees, and there is a significant reliance on the CEO and a single director for their key tenant relationships through Infinity Healthcare. This suggests a potential key-person risk rather than significant management depth across the organization.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, management concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The report from the independent registered public accounting firm, Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA, provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements. There is no history of restatements or disclosed material weaknesses, indicating that accounting controls are sound.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's key competitive advantage is its symbiotic relationship with Infinity Healthcare, an operator controlled by STRW's CEO and a director. The 10-K states this provides "unmatched insight into operating trends," "operating flexibility," and assistance in evaluating potential acquisitions. Additionally, the company's strategy of investing in states with Certificate of Need (CON) laws creates high regulatory barriers to entry, limiting new competition and protecting the value of its assets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's stated objective is to generate "attractive returns for our stockholders over the long term." This is supported by its aggressive and continuous acquisition strategy, which prioritizes the deployment of capital for portfolio growth over maximizing short-term earnings per share. Management's discussion focuses on building a diversified portfolio and leveraging relationships for sustained growth, which are hallmarks of a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company relies heavily on external capital to fund its growth-through-acquisition strategy. During 2024, it established an at-the-market (ATM) equity program and conducted an underwritten public offering in December 2024 for gross proceeds of approximately $35 million. The number of common shares outstanding nearly doubled in fiscal year 2024, from 6.49 million to 12.06 million. While necessary for its growth plan, this rate of issuance represents meaningful dilution for existing shareholders.
**Answer:** No

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's SEC filings are detailed and transparent, particularly regarding potentially sensitive areas like its high concentration of related-party tenants and ongoing legal proceedings. A review of available earnings call transcripts shows management openly addressing analyst questions. For instance, the Q1 2025 call includes discussion on performance and strategy. This level of disclosure in official filings and public calls suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Form 10-K discloses ongoing litigation against the CEO, a director, and company subsidiaries related to property acquisitions, with plaintiffs asserting claims of fraud and breach of contract. While the company denies the claims, the existence of such serious allegations prevents a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity. Additionally, the heavy reliance on related-party transactions (55.2% of annualized rent comes from tenants affiliated with the CEO and a director), while fully disclosed, presents a significant governance concern that could be perceived as prioritizing insider interests.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm (March 13, 2025)

Synthesis:
Strawberry Fields REIT scores well on Fisher's criteria related to its market opportunity, growth strategy, and core operational execution. The company benefits from strong demographic tailwinds in the senior care industry and has proven its ability to acquire and lease properties accretively, resulting in strong FFO margins and a secure, fully-leased portfolio. However, the analysis reveals significant weaknesses in areas of corporate governance and financial strategy. The firm's integrity is not "unquestionable" due to outstanding litigation alleging fraud against its top executives and a very high concentration of related-party dealings. Furthermore, the small management team raises concerns about depth and key-person risk, and its aggressive growth is funded by equity issuance that has been significantly dilutive to existing shareholders. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company resolves its legal issues favorably and demonstrates a clear path to diversifying its tenant base away from insiders, which would flip the "No" on integrity. A reduction in the pace of equity issuance relative to FFO growth would be needed to change the score on dilution risk.

fisher score is 11 / 15
