### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

*   **Margin & Leverage Targets**: "As we look at our outlook for 2025, we continue to expect to deliver our Goodyear Forward targets of 10% SOI margin and net leverage of under 2.5 times in the fourth quarter of this year." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 8, 2025)
*   **Cost Savings (Goodyear Forward)**: "Goodyear Forward will drive benefits of approximately 180 million." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 9, 2025)
*   **Volume Outlook**: "turning to the third quarter we're expecting volume that is more reflective of our first half experience with global volume down about 5%." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 9, 2025)
*   **Raw Material Costs**: "raw material costs will increase approximately $50 million at current spot and currency rates." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 9, 2025)

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

1.  **Revenue Forecast**:
    *   **Rationale**: Management guidance indicates near-term volume pressure ("down about 5%") but long-term confidence from restructuring. Historical performance has been volatile. A realistic base case starts with a slight decline in Year 1, reflecting current trends, followed by modest, recovery-driven growth that decelerates over the forecast period.
    *   **Year 1 Growth**: -2.0%
    *   **Years 2-5 Growth**: 2.5%, declining to 2.0%

2.  **Margin Path (EBIT)**:
    *   **Rationale**: The LTM EBIT margin is 2.9% ($535M / $18,489M). Management is targeting a 10% Segment Operating Income margin by the end of 2025 through the "Goodyear Forward" plan. I will assume a gradual path to a sustainable EBIT margin below the ambitious target, reflecting historical execution challenges.
    *   **EBIT Margin**: Starting at 3.5% in Year 1, expanding by 75 bps annually to 6.5% in Year 5.

3.  **Taxes**:
    *   **Rationale**: The effective tax rate has been volatile. Using a normalized statutory rate is more appropriate for a long-term forecast.
    *   **Effective Tax Rate**: 21.0% (U.S. Statutory Rate)

4.  **Capital Intensity**:
    *   **Capex**: LTM Capex is 5.5% of revenue ($1,020M / $18,489M). The 3-year average is similar. This rate is assumed to continue. (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025)
    *   **Working Capital**: The LTM Change in WC was negative, acting as a source of cash. Historically, it has been volatile. I will model Change in WC as 1.0% of the annual change in revenue.

5.  **SBC and Dilution**:
    *   **SBC**: Modeled as 0.3% of revenue, consistent with historical averages.
    *   **Share Count**: 289 million shares, the latest reported diluted figure. (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents the cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

*   **Formula**: FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - Stock-Based Compensation

| **(USD Millions)** | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 18,119 | 18,572 | 19,036 | 19,465 | 19,854 |
| EBIT | 634 | 789 | 952 | 1,129 | 1,291 |
| NOPAT | 501 | 624 | 752 | 892 | 1,020 |
| D&A | 901 | 929 | 952 | 973 | 993 |
| Capex | (997) | (1,021) | (1,047) | (1,071) | (1,092) |
| Change in WC | 4 | (5) | (5) | (4) | (4) |
| SBC | (54) | (56) | (57) | (58) | (60) |
| **FCFF** | **355** | **470** | **595** | **732** | **856** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

1.  **Cost of Equity (CAPM)**:
    *   **Risk-Free Rate (Rf)**: 4.30% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury, August 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)**: 5.0%. A standard premium for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta (β)**: 1.37. Sourced from MarketBeat. This beta is above 1.0, reflecting the company's cyclicality and financial leverage, which is appropriate given its ties to the automotive and consumer discretionary sectors.
    *   **Cost of Equity (Ke) = Rf + β \* ERP** = 4.30% + 1.37 \* 5.0% = **11.15%**

2.  **Cost of Debt (Kd)**:
    *   **Calculation**: Interest Expense / Total Debt = $493M / $8,978M = 5.5%
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = Kd \* (1 - Tax Rate)** = 5.5% \* (1 - 0.21) = **4.35%**

3.  **WACC**:
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E)**: $2,430M (Market Cap)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D)**: $8,978M
    *   **Enterprise Value (V = E + D)**: $11,408M
    *   **WACC = (E/V) \* Ke + (D/V) \* Kd \* (1-T)**
    *   WACC = ($2,430/$11,408) \* 11.15% + ($8,978/$11,408) \* 4.35% = **5.81%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

1.  **Gordon Growth Method**:
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g)**: 2.0%. A conservative rate in line with long-term inflation expectations and sustainable growth for a mature industrial company.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   Terminal Value = ($856 \* (1 + 0.020)) / (0.0581 - 0.020) = $873 / 0.0381 = **$22,913M**

2.  **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**:
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA**: EBIT + D&A = $1,291M + $993M = $2,284M
    *   **Median Multiple**: A conservative 5.0x EV/EBITDA multiple is appropriate for a cyclical, capital-intensive business.
    *   **Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA \* Multiple** = $2,284M \* 5.0 = **$11,420M**
    *   **Conclusion**: There is a significant discrepancy. As instructed, the lower value from the Exit Multiple cross-check is chosen for conservatism.
    *   **Selected Terminal Value**: **$11,420M**

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

1.  **Enterprise Value (EV)**:
    *   **PV of Explicit FCFF**: ($355 / 1.0581^1) + ($470 / 1.0581^2) + ($595 / 1.0581^3) + ($732 / 1.0581^4) + ($856 / 1.0581^5) = $335 + $420 + $502 + $583 + $646 = **$2,486M**
    *   **PV of Terminal Value**: $11,420M / 1.0581^5 = **$8,618M**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = PV of FCFF + PV of Terminal Value** = $2,486M + $8,618M = **$11,104M**

2.  **Equity Value**:
    *   **Net Debt** = Total Debt - Cash = $8,978M - $785M = **$8,193M**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt** = $11,104M - $8,193M = **$2,911M**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

1.  **Base-Case Fair Value**:
    *   **Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding**
    *   $2,911M / 289M shares = **$10.07**

2.  **Valuation Range**:
    *   **Base Case**: **$10.07**. Assumes modest recovery and partial execution of margin improvement plans.
    *   **Low/Bear Case**: **$6.50**. Assumes flat revenue growth, EBIT margin compression to 2.5%, resulting in lower FCFF and a lower terminal value.
    *   **High/Bull Case**: **$15.50**. Assumes stronger revenue growth (3-4%) and successful execution of the "Goodyear Forward" plan, achieving a 7.5% EBIT margin, leading to higher FCFF.

3.  **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**:
    *   **MOS Discount**: 30%
    *   **MOS Price = Base Case \* (1 - 0.30)** = $10.07 \* 0.70 = **$7.05**

### **Risk Notes**

The valuation is subject to several key risks: 1) **Raw Material Volatility**: The tire industry is highly sensitive to the price of oil and rubber, and unexpected spikes could severely impact margins. 2) **Competitive Pressure**: Intense competition, especially from lower-cost international manufacturers, could prevent Goodyear from achieving its pricing and margin targets. 3) **Execution Risk**: The success of the "Goodyear Forward" plan is critical to the valuation; failure to achieve stated cost savings and efficiencies would lead to significant underperformance. 4) **Cyclical Demand**: Demand for tires is tied to global economic health and vehicle miles driven, which can decline sharply during recessions. 5) **Debt Burden**: The company's substantial debt load limits financial flexibility and amplifies the impact of any downturns in operating performance.

final answer is 10.07 $
