United Parcel Service, Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: UPS 2024 10-K, UPS Q1 2025 10-Q, UPS Q2 2025 10-Q, UPS Q2 2025 Earnings Call.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The global logistics and package delivery market is projected to grow significantly. UPS is expanding its services in high-growth areas like healthcare and small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs). The company’s 2024 10-K highlights investments in these areas, as well as in international markets, as key to its long-term growth strategy. The rise of e-commerce continues to provide a tailwind for the entire sector, and UPS is a primary beneficiary of this secular trend.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS is actively investing in technology and new services. The company's 2024 10-K details investments in automation, artificial intelligence, and data analytics to improve efficiency and develop new customer-facing solutions. For instance, the company is expanding its digital platforms, like UPS Premier, to offer more sophisticated tracking and specialized services for critical shipments. This commitment to innovation is a recurring theme in their investor communications.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS does not explicitly break out "Research and Development" as a separate line item in its financial statements, which is common for logistics companies. Instead, these costs are typically embedded within "Other operating expenses". While the company frequently discusses innovation, the lack of specific R&D spending figures makes it difficult to assess the effectiveness of these efforts relative to the company's size or in comparison to competitors.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS has a vast and established global sales network. The company's strategy, as outlined in its 2024 10-K, emphasizes a "customer-first" approach, with a focus on capturing a larger share of the small and medium-sized business market. The company's ability to consistently win large contracts with major e-commerce players and its global brand recognition are indicative of a strong sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q2 2025 10-Q, UPS reported a consolidated operating margin of 10.0%. For the full year 2024, the operating margin was 9.9%. These margins are substantial for a logistics company and indicate efficient operations and strong pricing power.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS is focused on several initiatives to enhance profit margins.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS has a heavily unionized workforce, with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters representing a significant portion of its employees. While the company and the union successfully negotiated a new contract in 2023, the negotiations were contentious and highlighted some underlying tensions. The 2024 10-K acknowledges the risk of labor disputes. While a contract is in place, the relationship cannot be definitively described as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no public evidence of significant strife or instability among the executive team. The leadership team has been stable, with Carol B. Tomé serving as CEO since 2020. The company's proxy statements show a clear structure for executive compensation and governance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS has a well-defined management structure with experienced executives leading its various segments and functions. The company's investor relations website lists a detailed management team, and the 2024 10-K provides information on the background of its executive officers. This suggests a deep bench of talent beyond the CEO.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS provides detailed segment reporting in its financial statements, breaking down revenue and operating profit for its U.S. Domestic Package, International Package, and Supply Chain Solutions segments. The company's financial statements are audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, which has consistently provided an unqualified opinion. There is no indication of material weaknesses in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the logistics industry, network scale and density are paramount. UPS's extensive global network of air and ground transportation is a significant competitive advantage that is difficult and costly to replicate. This network effect means that each additional package and customer makes the network more efficient and valuable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in earnings calls and investor presentations consistently emphasizes long-term strategic initiatives. The "Network of the Future" plan, for example, requires significant upfront investment for long-term efficiency gains. This indicates a willingness to prioritize long-term profitability over short-term results.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS generates strong cash flow from operations. The company's Q2 2025 10-Q shows a healthy balance sheet with sufficient liquidity to fund its capital expenditures and dividend payments. The company has a consistent history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, indicating that dilutive equity financing is not on the horizon.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** UPS management regularly holds investor conference calls and provides detailed presentations. During the Q2 2025 earnings call, management addressed challenging market conditions and provided a candid outlook on the remainder of the year. This transparency during both good and bad times is a positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/UPS/transcripts/, July 23, 2025]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent, significant legal or regulatory actions against UPS that would call into question the integrity of its management. The company has a well-established corporate governance framework, as detailed in its proxy statements. The 2024 10-K does not reveal any material issues related to management integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1090727/000109072725000019/ups-20241231.htm, February 5, 2025]

Synthesis:
UPS scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong marks for its market position, profitability, management depth, and financial strength. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of e-commerce and is making strategic investments in high-growth areas. The primary areas of concern are the lack of transparency in R&D spending and the company's relationship with its unionized workforce. The score could improve in the next 12-24 months if the company provides more clarity on its innovation pipeline and R&D investments, and if it can demonstrate a more collaborative and stable relationship with the Teamsters. A "No" on R&D could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosure in financial reports, while a "No" on labor relations could be changed by a prolonged period of stability and positive joint statements with the union.

fisher score is 13 / 15
