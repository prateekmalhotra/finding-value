**Synthesis:**
Karooooo scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, strong market position, and financial strength. The company's vertically integrated business model is a key competitive advantage. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with more disclosure on R&D spending, which would help to better assess the effectiveness of their innovation efforts. Additionally, more information on succession planning and the depth of the management team beyond the CEO would be beneficial. A "No" on profit margins could be flipped to a "Yes" with a clear demonstration of sustained margin leadership against a defined peer group.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
