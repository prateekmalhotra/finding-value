Occidental Petroleum Corporation, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 10-K, Earnings Call Transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's primary products, crude oil and natural gas, are foundational to the global economy. While subject to price volatility, demand is expected to remain robust for the foreseeable future. The company's chemical segment (OxyChem) produces essential building blocks for various life-enhancing products, providing diversification. Critically, Occidental is making substantial investments in its Oxy Low Carbon Ventures (OLCV) subsidiary, focusing on carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and direct air capture (DAC) technologies. The STRATOS DAC facility, expected to commence operations in mid-2025, is a key project in what is anticipated to be a significant future market driven by global decarbonization efforts.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to ongoing development beyond its traditional oil and gas operations. The company's significant capital allocation to its OLCV business and the development of STRATOS, the world's largest direct air capture plant, signals a clear strategy to build a new, sustainable business line. The August 2024 acquisition of CrownRock for $12.4 billion also demonstrates a commitment to enhancing the company's core asset base in the Permian Basin to generate cash flow for these new ventures. Furthermore, the company is actively developing sequestration hubs and investing in technologies like NET Power for near-zero emissions electricity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's R&D, referred to as exploration expense in its financials, was $275 million in 2024, down from $441 million in 2023. This represents a small fraction of its $26.7 billion in revenue for 2024. However, the company's R&D is highly focused. It has developed proprietary technologies like the OXY JETTINGTM wellbore stimulation system and is a leader in CO2 enhanced oil recovery (EOR). The primary focus of its forward-looking R&D is now embodied in Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, particularly the development and commercialization of DAC technology. The effectiveness of this is demonstrated by the construction of the STRATOS facility and a joint venture with BlackRock for its development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/OXY/occidental-petroleum/research-development-expenses](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/OXY/occidental-petroleum/research-development-expenses) (2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a commodity producer, "sales" is more about marketing, transportation, and maximizing realized prices. Occidental's Midstream and Marketing segment is designed to provide flow assurance and enhance the value of its products. This segment aggregates, markets, and stores Occidental's and third-party volumes, and optimizes transportation and storage capacity to access domestic and international markets. The ability to manage Midland-to-Gulf-Coast oil spreads and Waha-to-Gulf-Coast gas spreads, as noted in the 10-K, is a key function of this group. The integrated nature of its operations, from production to marketing, provides a competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Occidental reported income from continuing operations of $2.9 billion on net sales of $26.7 billion, for a net margin of approximately 10.8%. While this is a decrease from previous years due to lower commodity prices, it still represents a significant margin. The company's competitive strategy, particularly in its OxyChem segment, is to be a low-cost producer to compete on price. In its oil and gas operations, a focus on high-return assets in the Permian and DJ basins aims to maintain low breakeven costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental is focused on several initiatives to maintain and improve margins. A key strategy is to be a low-cost producer in both its oil and gas and chemical segments. The company emphasizes cost-reduction efficiencies and the use of innovative technologies to reduce carbon emissions, which also has the effect of improving operational efficiency. The company's focus on its core, high-return assets in the Permian Basin, enhanced by the CrownRock acquisition, is intended to lower breakeven costs and maximize cash flow. In its chemical segment, the expansion and conversion of its Battleground chlor-alkali plant to membrane technology is a project designed to improve competitiveness.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental's 2024 10-K details its human capital resource strategies, emphasizing a culture built on core values such as "Deliver Results Responsibly" and "Commit to Good." The company offers extensive development and training opportunities, a "Balanced Workplace Program" for flexibility, and comprehensive health and wellness benefits, including enhanced mental health support. The company's health and safety record is described as "robust," with a focus on reducing incident severity. As of December 31, 2024, only 887 of its 13,323 total employees were unionized, suggesting a generally stable labor environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team listed in the 2024 10-K shows a mix of long-tenured executives and more recent hires, indicating both stability and the introduction of new perspectives. President and CEO Vicki Hollub has been in her role since 2016. The compensation programs are designed to align executive interests with company performance. The significant investment from Berkshire Hathaway can be seen as a vote of confidence in the management team and its long-term strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Information about Executive Officers" section of the 2024 10-K lists a team of eight senior executives with diverse backgrounds and extensive experience within Occidental and the broader energy and chemical industries. Key operational roles are clearly defined, such as President of U.S. Onshore Resources and Carbon Management and President of International Oil and Gas Operations. This structure suggests a good distribution of responsibilities and expertise, mitigating key person risk. The existence of the "Strategic Technical Excellence Program (STEP)" also indicates a focus on developing a pipeline of internal technical talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The report from the independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, dated February 18, 2025, provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The financial statements provide detailed segment reporting, allowing for analysis of costs and profitability by business line. There is no indication of material weaknesses or a history of significant restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental possesses a key competitive advantage through its decades of leadership in using carbon dioxide for enhanced oil recovery (EOR), particularly in the Permian Basin. This expertise provides a natural foundation for its strategic pivot into CCUS and DAC. This allows OXY to not only improve production from mature fields but also to build a new business line in carbon management. The company's large, contiguous acreage in core U.S. basins like the Permian and DJ Basins provides economies of scale and a deep inventory of drilling locations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy clearly demonstrates a long-range outlook. The substantial investment in the OLCV segment and the multi-year construction of the STRATOS DAC facility are prime examples of prioritizing long-term, durable growth in the low-carbon economy over immediate profits. These ventures require significant upfront capital and will take years to generate substantial returns. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, management consistently emphasizes their commitment to their long-term strategy of deleveraging, shareholder returns, and growing their carbon management business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OXY/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OXY/transcripts/) (August 7, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Occidental had cash of $2.1 billion and a total principal debt of $24.4 billion. While the debt level is substantial, the company generated $11.7 billion in cash flow from continuing operations in 2024. Management's stated capital allocation strategy prioritizes deleveraging until principal debt is below $15 billion before resuming share repurchases. The company has a $3.0 billion share repurchase program authorized, though it is paused. While the CrownRock acquisition involved issuing 29.6 million shares, the primary funding was cash and debt. The company's strong operating cash flow suggests it can fund its growth plans without significant further equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Review of recent earnings call transcripts, such as the Q2 2025 call, shows management addressing a wide range of analyst questions directly, covering both successes and challenges. They openly discuss commodity price volatility, operational details, and the progress and risks associated with their long-term carbon capture strategy. The company's 10-K includes an extensive "Risk Factors" section that details numerous potential challenges to their business. This level of disclosure and engagement suggests a commitment to transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OXY/transcripts/2025/2/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/OXY/transcripts/2025/2/) (August 7, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Occidental has significant ongoing legal proceedings and environmental liabilities, which are detailed extensively in its 10-K. A notable issue is the Anadarko Tronox settlement, where the deductibility of a $5.2 billion payment is being disputed by the IRS, with a potential liability of approximately $2.1 billion. The company also faces significant environmental remediation liabilities, with a possible additional loss of up to $1.9 billion beyond current reserves. While large energy companies often face such issues, the scale and nature of these items prevent a straightforward "Yes." The company is transparent in its disclosures, but the existence of these major, unresolved legal and financial disputes raises questions.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/797468/000079746825000029/oxy-20241231.htm) (February 18, 2025)

Synthesis:
Occidental Petroleum scores well on most of Fisher's points, demonstrating strong operational capabilities, a clear long-term strategy, and a commitment to developing a new, potentially massive business in carbon management. The company's established position in the Permian Basin, combined with its pioneering work in CO2 EOR and direct air capture, presents a unique competitive advantage. The primary negative factor is the significant and unresolved legacy legal and environmental liabilities, particularly the Tronox tax dispute, which clouds the otherwise positive picture of management's integrity and financial stewardship. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the operational startup of the STRATOS DAC facility, which would validate their low-carbon strategy, and a final resolution of the Tronox tax case. A favorable outcome in the tax case and a successful launch of STRATOS would likely flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes" and solidify the company's position as a premier long-term investment according to Fisher's criteria.

fisher score is 14 / 15
