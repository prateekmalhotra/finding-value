### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

From the latest financial releases, management has provided the following outlook for the full fiscal year 2025:
*   **Cloud and Software Revenue:** "€33.1 – €33.6 billion... up 11% to 13% at constant currencies." (MarketScreener, July 22, 2025)
*   **Non-IFRS Operating Profit:** "€10.3 – €10.6 billion... up 26% to 30% at constant currencies." (MarketScreener, July 22, 2025)
*   **Management Commentary:** In the Q1 2025 earnings call, CFO Dominik Asam confirmed, "we decided to leave our 2025 outlook across all metrics unchanged." (Q1 2025 Transcript, April 22, 2025)

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** 12.0%. This is the midpoint of the 11-13% guidance for cloud and software revenue, which is the core of the business. (MarketScreener, July 22, 2025)
    *   **Years 2-5:** I project a gradual deceleration from 11.0% to 8.0%. This reflects a prudent assumption that the initial high growth from cloud transformation will moderate over time towards a more mature growth rate.
*   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin):**
    *   The TTM EBIT margin is 27.0% (€9,692M / €35,887M). Management's 2025 guidance for operating profit (€10.45B midpoint) on guided total revenue (estimated at ~€38B based on cloud/software growth) implies a similar margin. I will keep the operating margin stable at **27.0%** for the forecast period. This is a conservative assumption, as it does not factor in significant margin expansion from AI-driven efficiencies mentioned by management, requiring more concrete evidence for a base case.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   The effective tax rate for the TTM period was **29.2%**. (StockAnalysis Income Statement, Aug 21, 2025). This rate will be used for the forecast period.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex as a percentage of revenue is 2.2% (€790M / €35,887M). I will hold this percentage constant.
    *   **Working Capital:** The TTM change in working capital was negative. To be conservative, I'll model the change in working capital as **1.0% of incremental revenue**, a more normalized historical assumption.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   SBC is treated as a cash expense. The TTM SBC as a percentage of revenue is 3.3% (€1,172M / €35,887M). This percentage will be held constant.
    *   The share count for the final per-share value calculation is **1,179 million**. (StockAnalysis Income Statement, Aug 21, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions €) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 40,193 | 44,615 | 49,076 | 53,493 | 57,772 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *12.0%* | *11.0%* | *10.0%* | *9.0%* | *8.0%* |
| EBIT (27.0% margin) | 10,852 | 12,046 | 13,251 | 14,443 | 15,599 |
| Tax on EBIT (29.2%) | (3,169) | (3,517) | (3,869) | (4,217) | (4,555) |
| **NOPAT** | **7,683** | **8,529** | **9,381** | **10,226** | **11,044** |
| Add: D&A (3.1% of Rev) | 1,246 | 1,383 | 1,521 | 1,658 | 1,791 |
| Less: SBC (3.3% of Rev) | (1,326) | (1,472) | (1,620) | (1,765) | (1,906) |
| Less: Capex (2.2% of Rev) | (884) | (981) | (1,080) | (1,177) | (1,271) |
| Less: Change in WC | (43) | (44) | (44) | (42) | (43) |
| **FCFF** | **6,676** | **7,414** | **8,159** | **8,899** | **9,614** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 2.75% (German 10-Year Bund Yield, August 21, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. This is a standard assumption for a mature global market.
    *   **Beta:** 0.93 (5-Year Monthly Beta). A beta close to 1.0 is justified as SAP is a large, globally diversified company whose performance is closely tied to the broader economy and IT spending cycles. (Stock Analysis, August 21, 2025)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 2.75% + 0.93 * 5.0% = 7.40%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt = €561M / €8,746M = 6.41%**
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 6.41% * (1 - 29.2%) = 4.54%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   **Market Value of Equity (Market Cap):** €276.09 billion (Companies Market Cap, August 2025)
    *   **Market Value of Debt:** €8.75 billion
    *   **Total Capital:** €284.84 billion
    *   **WACC = (E/(E+D)) * CoE + (D/(E+D)) * After-Tax CoD**
    *   **WACC = (276.09/284.84) * 7.40% + (8.75/284.84) * 4.54% = 7.17% + 0.14% = 7.31%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term global inflation expectations and a mature growth rate for a large-cap software company.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (€9,614 * 1.025) / (7.31% - 2.5%) = €9,854 / 4.81% = €204,865 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = €15,599M + €1,791M = €17,390M**
    *   A historical median EV/EBITDA multiple for the software sector is around 15.0x.
    *   **Terminal Value (Multiple) = €17,390M * 15.0 = €260,850 million**
    *   As there's a discrepancy, the more conservative Gordon Growth terminal value of **€204,865 million** will be used, per the instructions.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Calculation | Value (in millions €) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Year 1-5 FCFF | 31,540 |
| PV of Terminal Value | 143,778 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **175,318** |
| Less: Total Debt | (8,746) |
| Add: Cash & Equivalents | 7,942 |
| **Equity Value** | **174,514** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **€174,514 million / 1,179 million shares = €148.02 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **€148.02**. Assumes management guidance is met and growth moderates.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: €115**. Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 9-10% in Year 1), 2% margin compression due to competition, and a higher WACC of 8.0%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: €185**. Assumes sustained higher revenue growth (e.g., 13-14% in Year 1), 2% margin expansion from AI efficiencies, and a lower WACC of 7.0%.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 25% discount to the base-case value.
    *   **MOS Price = €148.02 * (1 - 0.25) = €111.02**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Execution Risk:** The ongoing transition to the cloud (RISE with SAP) is complex. Any failures in execution, customer adoption, or migration could negatively impact revenue and profitability.
2.  **Competition:** SAP faces intense competition from cloud-native SaaS providers like Salesforce and Oracle, which could pressure pricing and market share, potentially compressing margins.
3.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As a global software provider, SAP's results are sensitive to global IT spending, which can be curtailed by geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, or a broad economic recession, impacting customer conversion rates and deal sizes.
4.  **AI Monetization:** The valuation does not explicitly price in significant upside from AI initiatives. The ability to successfully develop, integrate, and monetize new AI offerings presents both a major opportunity and a risk if adoption falls short of expectations.
