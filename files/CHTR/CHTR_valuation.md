### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **Year 1:** 0.6% (latest quarterly growth rate). <br> **Years 2-5:** 1.0% annually, reflecting modest growth from mobile and broadband, offset by video declines. | Q2 2025 Press Release |
| **Operating Margin** | 24.0% of revenue, held flat. This is slightly below the LTM margin of 24.0% and reflects competitive pressures. | LTM calculation |
| **Tax Rate** | 24.0%. This is in line with the effective tax rates reported in recent filings. | Q1 2025 10-Q |
| **Capex** | **Year 1:** $11.5 billion. <br> **Years 2-5:** 20% of revenue, slightly below the LTM rate of 20.0%, reflecting completion of rural buildout initiatives. | Q2 2025 Press Release |
| **Change in WC** | 0.0% of incremental revenue. Assumed to be negligible for modeling purposes. |  |
| **SBC** | 1.2% of revenue, consistent with the LTM average of 1.2%. | LTM calculation |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |

| **FCFF** | **$6,666** | **$7,032** | **$7,016** | **$6,998** | **$6,982** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value/Calculation | Rationale/Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 20, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium for a mature market. |
| Beta | 1.02 | 5-year monthly beta, reflecting market volatility. |
| **Cost of Equity** | 4.29% + 1.02 \* 5.0% = **9.39%** | |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Interest Expense / Avg. Debt | 5.4% | LTM Interest Expense / Average Total Debt |
| Tax Rate | 24.0% | Assumed tax rate |
| **After-Tax Cost of Debt** | 5.4% \* (1 - 24.0%) = **4.10%** | |
| **WACC** | | |
| Market Cap | $36,580M | MarketBeat (August 18, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $94,300M | Q2 2025 Press Release |
| **WACC** | (36,580 / 130,880) \* 9.39% + (94,300 / 130,880) \* 4.10% = **5.58%** | |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Component | Value/Calculation | Rationale/Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Model** | | |
| Terminal FCFF | $6,982 \* (1 + 2.5%) = $7,157M | |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.5% | Long-run inflation expectation. |
| **Terminal Value** | $7,157 / (5.58% - 2.5%) = **$232,370M** | |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | | |
| LTM EBITDA | $13,240 (EBIT) + $8,694 (D&A) = $21,934M | LTM calculation |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $13,883 (EBIT) + $8,694 (D&A) = $22,577M | |
| Historical Median Multiple | 8.5x | Based on current P/E ratio, as a proxy. |
| **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple)** | $22,577M \* 8.5x = **$191,905M** | |
| **Selected Terminal Value** | **$191,905M** | The lower of the two values is selected for a conservative estimate. |

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (in millions) |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit Period FCFF | $30,102 |
| PV of Terminal Value | $146,558 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$176,660** |
| Less: Total Debt | ($94,300) |
| Add: Cash & Equivalents | $796 |
| **Equity Value** | **$83,156** |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value | Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case** | **$575.08** | As calculated above. |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$450** | 0% revenue growth, 22% EBIT margin, 7.5x exit multiple. |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$700** | 2% revenue growth, 25% EBIT margin, 9.5x exit multiple. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$402.56** | 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value. |

### **I) Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** Intense competition from fiber-to-the-home, fixed wireless, and satellite providers could pressure customer growth and pricing power.
2.  **Cord-Cutting:** Continued decline in traditional video subscribers may negatively impact high-margin revenue streams and bundling strategies.
3.  **Capital Intensity:** The need for significant capital expenditures to upgrade and expand the network could reduce free cash flow generation.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in regulations, particularly around net neutrality and broadband pricing, could adversely affect the business.
5.  **Debt Load:** The company's substantial debt load makes it vulnerable to rising interest rates and could limit financial flexibility.
