### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
CAAP's network effects are limited. While operating a large number of airports creates a portfolio effect, there is little direct benefit to a passenger at one airport from the existence of other CAAP airports in different countries. The primary customers are airlines and passengers, and their choice of airport is driven by geography and destination, not by the airport operator's brand across a wider network.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   CAAP operates 52 airports in 6 countries across Latin America and Europe. (Corporación América Airports Announces Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Call and Webcast, August 14, 2025).
*   In 2024, CAAP served 79.0 million passengers. (Corporación América Airports Announces Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Call and Webcast, August 14, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Airlines, the primary customers, face moderately high switching costs. Establishing routes, gate agreements, and ground handling operations at a particular airport represents a significant investment of capital and logistical planning. While airlines can and do move routes, the disruption and cost of doing so for their entire operation at a major airport are substantial.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Long-term concession agreements create a sticky customer base of airlines that are unlikely to switch airports for established routes.
*   Aeronautical revenues are driven by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, which are tied to long-term route planning by airlines. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).

**Score:** 3 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
CAAP's cost advantages stem from economies of scale in airport management and operations across its portfolio. The company can centralize certain functions and leverage its experience to operate airports efficiently. However, these advantages are not insurmountable and are geographically dependent.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company has a diversified portfolio that allows it to mitigate weaker domestic traffic in some regions with stronger performance in others. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).
*   The company is focused on stringent cost controls to maintain a streamlined cost structure. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).

**Score:** 3 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
CAAP's brand is not a primary driver of passenger or airline choice. Passengers choose airports based on location and flight availability, not the operator's brand. The company's key intangible assets are its concession agreements, which are discussed under Regulatory/Legal Barriers.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's value proposition is based on its ability to acquire, develop, and operate airport concessions, not on brand recognition. (Corporación América Airports Announces Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Call and Webcast, August 14, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
CAAP benefits from efficient scale in its markets. The high capital costs and long lead times to build new airports make it impractical to have competing airports in most of the regions CAAP serves. This creates a natural monopoly for each airport.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   CAAP operates some of the largest and most important airports in the countries where it is present.
*   The company's presence in key geographies makes it a critical part of the regional transportation infrastructure. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).

**Score:** 4 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
CAAP has access to a significant amount of passenger and operational data. However, there is limited evidence of how this data is being used to create a competitive advantage. The data is primarily used for operational efficiency rather than creating a data-driven moat.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company reports detailed passenger traffic and cargo volume data.
*   There is no evidence in the reviewed documents of a data-driven feedback loop that improves product and increases retention.

**Score:** 2 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
CAAP's airports are not platforms in the traditional sense. While they host a variety of businesses (airlines, retail, concessions), these are tenants and service providers, not a self-reinforcing ecosystem. There is no significant third-party developer adoption or complementary product marketplace.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Commercial revenues are generated from sources like duty-free stores, car parking, and food and beverage, which are typical airport services rather than a platform ecosystem. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).

**Score:** 1 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
This is CAAP's strongest moat source. The company operates under long-term concession agreements with governments, which grant it the exclusive right to operate specific airports. These agreements are difficult and costly to obtain and represent a significant barrier to entry for competitors.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   CAAP's business model is based on acquiring, developing, and operating airport concessions. (Corporación América Airports Announces Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Call and Webcast, August 14, 2025).
*   The majority of CAAP's revenues in Argentina, its largest market, are derived from international traffic, which is governed by these concession agreements. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).

**Score:** 5 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
The airport industry is extremely capital intensive. The cost of building or acquiring an airport is immense, and the assets are highly specific with no alternative use. This high capital barrier protects incumbent operators like CAAP from new entrants.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's business involves developing and operating airport concessions, which requires significant capital investment in infrastructure. (Corporación América Airports Announces Second Quarter 2025 Financial Results Call and Webcast, August 14, 2025).

**Score:** 5 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
CAAP's revenue visibility is high due to its long-term concession agreements. Aeronautical revenues are predictable and tied to passenger and aircraft movements. Commercial revenues are also relatively stable, although they can be affected by economic downturns.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Aeronautical revenues are driven by passenger traffic and aircraft movements, which provide a degree of predictability. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).
*   The company's diversified portfolio provides revenue stability, with strong performance in some regions offsetting weakness in others. (Corporación América Airports SA NYSE:CAAP - Earnings Call, August 22, 2024).

**Score:** 4 / 5

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(2 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (5 * 0.06) + (5 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0.36 + 0.45 + 0.45 + 0.24 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.08 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.08 = **2.76**

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 55.2 / 100

### Mapping
The weighted score of 55.2 falls within the 50-70 range, which maps to a moat rating of 3.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is 10-15 years. This is primarily based on the long-term nature of the company's concession agreements, which are its strongest competitive advantage. The renewal of these concessions is the key event that could impact the moat. The exact expiry dates of the concessions are not available in the reviewed documents, but they are typically for long periods (e.g., 20-30 years).

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Non-renewal of key concession agreements:** The failure to renew concessions in major markets like Argentina or Brazil would significantly erode CAAP's moat.
2.  **Regulatory changes:** Governments could impose stricter regulations, such as lower tariffs or higher concession fees, which would reduce profitability.
3.  **Economic downturns:** A severe and prolonged economic recession in Latin America would reduce passenger traffic and commercial revenues, weakening the company's financial position.

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Passenger traffic growth:** A sustained decline would indicate a weakening of the company's core business.
2.  **Revenue per passenger:** This metric reflects the company's ability to monetize its passenger base.
3.  **Adjusted EBITDA margin:** A declining margin would suggest a loss of cost control or pricing power.
4.  **Concession agreement renewals and expirations:** The key indicator of the moat's durability.
5.  **Capital expenditures:** High capex could indicate the need for significant investments to maintain the quality of the airports.
6.  **Geographic revenue diversification:** Over-reliance on a single market increases risk.
7.  **Aeronautical vs. Commercial revenue mix:** A growing share of commercial revenue would indicate a stronger and more diversified business.
8.  **Regulatory developments in key markets:** Any news of potential changes to concession agreements should be monitored closely.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Corporación América Airports S.A. has a moderate moat, primarily derived from its long-term concession agreements (Regulatory/Legal Barriers) and the high capital intensity of the airport industry. These factors create significant barriers to entry and provide a degree of revenue visibility. However, the company's moat is not unassailable. It is susceptible to political and regulatory risks in its key markets, and it lacks strong network effects or intangible asset advantages. The renewal of its concession agreements is the most critical factor for the long-term sustainability of its moat. A successful renewal of key concessions would strengthen the moat rating, while a failure to do so would significantly weaken it.
