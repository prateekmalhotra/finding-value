Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Annual Report (February 19, 2025), Q2 2025 Shareholder Report (July 30, 2025), Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (August 6, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan's core business is non-fashion basic apparel (t-shirts, fleece, underwear), a mature but large market. Growth is being driven by market share gains and expansion within its core distributor and national account channels. In the second quarter of 2025, the company reported 12% sales growth in its Activewear segment, which accounts for the vast majority of its revenue, citing share gains in key categories. The company's "Gildan Sustainable Growth" (GSG) strategy is focused on driving growth through new product innovations and its low-cost, vertically integrated manufacturing model.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment is centered on its GSG strategy. The 2024 Annual Report highlights the launch of its "most extensive innovation pipeline to date," including a proprietary "soft cotton technology" developed by re-engineering its production process. The Q2 2025 earnings call noted a positive market response to these new products, which are a key pillar of the growth strategy. The company also continues to invest in manufacturing, including ramping up its new facility in Bangladesh to support long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan does not explicitly disclose its Research & Development spending as a percentage of revenue, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. The company’s innovation is focused on process improvements (e.g., vertical integration) and fabric characteristics (e.g., soft cotton technology) rather than fundamental research. While the output of this development appears effective in driving sales, the lack of transparent input metrics prevents a full assessment of its efficiency relative to company size.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales performance indicates an effective organization. In its Q2 2025 results, Gildan reported 12% growth in its primary Activewear segment, attributing it to higher sales volumes and market share gains. Management commentary highlighted positive sales momentum at U.S. Distributors and with National accounts, which are its key channels. This consistent ability to gain share in a competitive, mature market suggests an above-average sales function.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan demonstrates strong profitability. For the full year 2024, the company reported an adjusted operating margin of 21.3%. This performance continued into 2025, with the second quarter showing an even higher adjusted operating margin of 22.7%. These margins are robust for the apparel manufacturing industry and reflect the cost advantages of its vertically integrated business model.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan is actively focused on margin maintenance and improvement. In its Q2 2025 earnings call, management attributed a 110 basis point improvement in gross margin to lower raw material costs, lower manufacturing costs, and favorable pricing. The company's core strategy of vertical integration, from yarn spinning to finished garments, is its primary tool for cost control. Ongoing investments in large-scale, efficient manufacturing facilities are central to this effort.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/GILDAN-ACTIVEWEAR-INC-12716/news/Gildan-Activewear-Q2-2025-Earnings-Conference-Call-Transcript-46593574/](https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/GILDAN-ACTIVEWEAR-INC-12716/news/Gildan-Activewear-Q2-2025-Earnings-Conference-Call-Transcript-46593574/) (August 6, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company publicly emphasizes its commitment to employee well-being. In its 2024 ESG report, Gildan highlights achieving ISO 45001 certification, an international standard for occupational health and safety, in additional facilities. The company also states its commitment to fair and responsible compensation. While manufacturing in low-cost countries can present labor risks, the company's formal disclosures and certifications point to a structured and positive approach to personnel relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_downloads/esg/2024/Gildan_2024_ESG_Report_EN.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_downloads/esg/2024/Gildan_2024_ESG_Report_EN.pdf) (May 20, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Executive relations have been extremely poor and unstable. In late 2023 and early 2024, Gildan underwent a highly public and acrimonious proxy battle, which resulted in the termination of co-founder and CEO Glenn Chamandy, followed by his reinstatement after an activist shareholder campaign successfully replaced the majority of the board of directors. The 2024 Annual Report notes significant expenses related to "leadership changes and related matters." This level of turmoil is the opposite of outstanding executive relations.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent proxy contest and board turnover create significant uncertainty around management depth. The new board, elected on May 28, 2024, re-installed Glenn Chamandy as CEO. While the CFO and other key executives are named in filings, the recent period of intense conflict and change suggests that the stability and depth of the broader senior leadership team is unproven. The focus has been almost entirely on the CEO and board, with little disclosure on the development of broader management bench strength.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan's financial reporting and controls appear robust. The company's auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 29, 2024. Furthermore, the auditor's report stated that the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of that date. There is no recent history of restatements or major internal control weaknesses disclosed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/2024-gildan-annual-report-en.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/2024-gildan-annual-report-en.pdf) (February 19, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Gildan’s primary competitive advantage is its large-scale, vertically integrated manufacturing model. Unlike many competitors who outsource production, Gildan controls the process from yarn spinning through sewing and distribution. This provides significant, durable advantages in cost, quality control, and supply chain reliability. The 2024 Annual Report highlights a $150 million investment in this system as a core component of its strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/2024-gildan-annual-report-en.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/2024-gildan-annual-report-en.pdf) (February 19, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy demonstrates a long-range outlook. The "Gildan Sustainable Growth" (GSG) strategy and related "Next Generation ESG" strategy are multi-year plans. Management consistently emphasizes long-term value creation and reinvestment in its manufacturing footprint, such as the Bangladesh facility, to secure future cost advantages and capacity. This focus on large-scale capital projects for future benefit, rather than maximizing near-term EPS, supports a long-range view.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/GIL-Q2-2025-Report-to-Shareholders-EN-Final.pdf](https://s2.q4cdn.com/983416186/files/doc_financials/2025/q2/GIL-Q2-2025-Report-to-Shareholders-EN-Final.pdf) (July 30, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, and its capital allocation policy favors returning cash to shareholders, not raising it from them. In 2024, Gildan generated $389 million in free cash flow and returned a record $889 million to shareholders via $134 million in dividends and $756 million in share repurchases. The company continued repurchasing shares in 2025, buying back 7.9% of its public float between August 2024 and July 2025. This demonstrates significant financial strength and a commitment to avoiding shareholder dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** During the recent governance crisis, the company and the dissident shareholders were extremely vocal. Both sides published detailed investor presentations and press releases arguing their cases. The company also transparently discloses the significant costs incurred during the proxy fight in its quarterly reports, such as the $57.2 million in Q2 2024. While the situation was adversarial, it was not characterized by a lack of communication; on the contrary, management was highly communicative about the turmoil.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** It is not possible to answer yes to this question given recent events. The proxy fight that consumed the company in late 2023 and early 2024 involved serious allegations from both the former board and the activist investor. The former board accused the reinstated CEO of being disengaged and having a flawed strategy, while the activist accused the board of poor oversight and value destruction. Regardless of the merits of either side, such a public and bitter dispute at the highest level of the company makes it impossible to conclude that management has "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No

---
**Synthesis:**
Gildan's primary strengths lie in its powerful, vertically integrated business model, which delivers strong margins and free cash flow, and its effective sales organization driving market share gains. The company is financially robust, actively returning capital to shareholders while investing in long-term growth initiatives. However, the company's score is severely damaged by the recent and extreme governance turmoil. The proxy fight and complete overhaul of the board and CEO role raises significant questions about executive stability, management depth, and overall integrity. The most critical variable that could change the score in the next 12–24 months is the ability of the reinstated CEO and new board to establish a period of stable and effective governance. Evidence of a cohesive strategy, achievement of financial targets without further infighting, and building out a clear succession plan would be required to flip the "No" answers on points 8, 9, and 15 to "Yes".
