### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Forecast:**
    *   **Year 1 (2025):** Management's commentary indicates significant headwinds, with a 36% YoY revenue decline in Q2 2025 and a 40% decline in subscribers. Given the Q3 guidance midpoint of $76M, a continued sharp decline is expected. A **-25%** growth rate for the full year 2025 is assumed, reflecting the ongoing business transition and competitive pressures from AI.
    *   **Years 2-5:** A gradual recovery is projected as the company pivots to its skills-based and AI-integrated offerings. I assume a growth trajectory of **-5% in Year 2, +5% in Year 3, +7% in Year 4, and +5% in Year 5**, reflecting a slow stabilization and return to modest growth. This is a conservative estimate grounded in the current challenges.

*   **Margin Path (Operating Margin):**
    *   Chegg's TTM operating margin is deeply negative due to impairment charges and restructuring. I will use a normalized EBIT margin based on historical performance before the recent downturn and management's cost-saving initiatives. The average operating margin from 2020-2022 was approximately 8%. Given the significant revenue decline and business model shift, a lower, more conservative **5% operating margin** is assumed throughout the forecast period.

*   **Taxes:**
    *   The effective tax rate has been volatile. A normalized statutory rate of **21%** is used, which is a standard assumption for U.S. companies.

*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Management guided to $7M in Capex savings in 2026. The 3-year average Capex as a percentage of revenue is approximately 11%. A reduced rate of **8% of revenue** is assumed, reflecting cost discipline.
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeled at **0.5% of incremental revenue**, based on the historical relationship.

*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation is treated as a real cash expense. The 3-year average is approximately 15% of revenue. A more conservative **10% of revenue** is used in the forecast.
    *   The final share count is the latest reported figure of **108.3 million** diluted shares. (Form 10-Q, August 4, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | $380.0 | $361.0 | $379.0 | $405.5 | $425.8 |
| **EBIT (5% margin)** | $19.0 | $18.0 | $19.0 | $20.3 | $21.3 |
| **EBIT (1-Tax Rate)** | $15.0 | $14.2 | $15.0 | $16.0 | $16.8 |
| **+ D&A** | $30.4 | $28.9 | $30.3 | $32.4 | $34.1 |
| **- SBC** | ($38.0) | ($36.1) | ($37.9) | ($40.6) | ($42.6) |
| **- Capex** | ($30.4) | ($28.9) | ($30.3) | ($32.4) | ($34.1) |
| **- Change in WC** | ($0.6) | $0.1 | ($0.1) | ($0.1) | ($0.1) |
| **FCFF** | **($23.6)** | **($21.8)** | **($22.9)** | **($24.7)** | **($25.9)** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0% (standard market premium)
    *   **Beta (Î²):** 1.47 (Average from multiple sources, reflecting higher volatility due to industry disruption).
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.29% + 1.47 * 5.0% = 11.64%*

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Calculated as TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $1.8M / $62.5M = 2.88%.
    *   *After-Tax Cost of Debt = 2.88% * (1 - 21%) = 2.28%*

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Cap (Equity Value) = 108.3M shares * $1.12/share = $121.3M
    *   Market Value of Debt = $62.5M
    *   Total Capital = $183.8M
    *   *WACC = (11.64% * 121.3/183.8) + (2.28% * 62.5/183.8) = 7.67% + 0.78% = 8.45%*

---

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A conservative terminal growth rate (`g`) of **2.0%** is used, reflecting long-term inflation expectations.
    *   *Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)*
    *   *Terminal Value = (-$25.9M * 1.02) / (8.45% - 2.0%) = -$409.5M*

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:** Due to negative TTM and projected EBITDA, an exit multiple cross-check is not meaningful. The Gordon Growth method will be used, but the negative FCFF indicates a negative terminal value, a significant finding.

---

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   The present value of the explicit period FCFF and the terminal value are calculated using the 8.45% WACC.
    *   The sum of discounted cash flows results in a negative Enterprise Value, as the company is projected to burn cash throughout the forecast period and into perpetuity based on these assumptions. A negative enterprise value implies the company's core operations are destroying value. In this situation, the enterprise value is floored at zero for the purpose of the equity bridge.
    *   **Enterprise Value = $0**

*   **Equity Value:**
    *   *Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $62.5M - $36.8M = $25.7M.
    *   **Equity Value = $0 - $25.7M = -$25.7M**

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

Given the negative Equity Value derived from the DCF model, the intrinsic value per share is **$0.00**. This result is driven by the projection of negative free cash flows, a consequence of declining revenues, compressing margins, and continued stock-based compensation and capital expenditures.

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $0.00/share.** This reflects the current trajectory where costs and investments outpace the profits from a shrinking revenue base.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $0.00/share.** This assumes a faster revenue decline and an inability to control costs, leading to even greater cash burn.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** A bull case would require a rapid and successful pivot to the new skills-based model, a reversal of subscriber declines, and significant margin expansion. Even with optimistic assumptions (e.g., 10% revenue growth after year 2, 10% EBIT margin), the high stock-based compensation and capex would likely still result in a low intrinsic value. A precise value is difficult to justify given the current evidence.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% margin of safety to a $0.00 base case results in a **Margin of Safety Price of $0.00.**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competitive Threat from AI:** The primary risk is the continued erosion of Chegg's user base by free or low-cost generative AI tools, which has already caused a significant decline in subscribers and revenue.
2.  **Execution Risk in Strategic Pivot:** The company's future value is highly dependent on a successful pivot to a skills-based learning model. Failure to execute this strategy and gain market traction will likely lead to continued financial deterioration.
3.  **High Stock-Based Compensation:** SBC remains a significant expense, representing a substantial portion of revenue and a drain on cash flow available to shareholders.
4.  **Negative Cash Flow:** The model projects negative free cash flow for the foreseeable future, meaning the company is destroying rather than creating value for its capital providers. This is an unsustainable long-term position.
5.  **Dependence on Search Engine Traffic:** As noted by management, changes in Google's search algorithm (specifically AI Overviews) have materially reduced traffic to Chegg's website, a trend that may persist or worsen.
