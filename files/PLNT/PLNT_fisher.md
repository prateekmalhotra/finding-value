**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a franchise- and corporate-owned gym operator, Planet Fitness's R&D is focused on club design, equipment selection, and digital offerings rather than traditional product R&D. The company's recent initiatives, such as testing new club layouts and enhancing its mobile app, demonstrate a focus on innovation. However, there is limited publicly available data to benchmark the effectiveness of these efforts against peers in the fitness industry.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?

The company recently raised the price of its Classic Card membership, which is expected to increase revenue. The company is also focused on cost management and is exploring ways to reduce build-out costs for new gyms.

This includes competitive pay and benefits, training programs, and various feedback channels for employees.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness's "Judgement Free Zone" marketing and low-price model are key differentiators that have allowed it to attract a large and loyal member base.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Planet Fitness has a long-range outlook focused on sustainable growth.

**Synthesis:**
Planet Fitness scores well on many of Fisher's 15 points, demonstrating a strong business model, a long runway for growth, and a commitment to shareholder value. The company's key strengths include its differentiated brand positioning, its attractive franchise model, and its strong financial performance. The recent change in leadership appears to be a positive development, with the new CEO and management team focused on driving growth and profitability. The primary areas for improvement are in providing more transparency into R&D effectiveness and management depth. Over the next 12-24 months, the key variables that could change the score are the successful execution of the new store opening plan, the impact of the Classic Card price increase on member growth and retention, and the ability of the new management team to continue to drive innovation and growth. To flip the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to provide more detailed disclosure on its R&D spending and effectiveness, as well as more information on the depth and experience of its management team beyond the named executives.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
