**Synthesis:**
Texas Roadhouse scores highly on the Fisher checklist, with its primary strengths being its strong brand, efficient operations, and a clear growth strategy. The company's "People-First" culture and unique owner-operator model are key competitive advantages that drive its success. The only "No" on the checklist is for R&D effectiveness, which is a nuanced point for a restaurant company. While Texas Roadhouse may not have a formal R&D department, its innovation in operations and technology is impressive and effective. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the expansion of the Bubba's 33 and Jaggers concepts, and the company's ability to continue to manage inflationary pressures without sacrificing its value proposition. A successful rollout of these newer concepts would further solidify the company's long-term growth prospects and could turn the "No" on R&D into a "Yes".
