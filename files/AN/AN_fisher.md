Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed: AutoNation, Inc. (AN), August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K filed February 14, 2025, and earnings call transcripts.

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation is expanding its offerings beyond core vehicle sales to capture more of the vehicle ownership lifecycle. The company is growing its captive finance arm, AutoNation Finance, its mobile repair business, AutoNation Mobile Service, and its network of AutoNation USA used vehicle stores. These initiatives are designed to diversify revenue streams and increase customer retention within the massive and constantly refreshing market for personal transportation.

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's business strategy explicitly states its intent to expand through the development and/or acquisition of key capabilities, products, and resources. Recent examples include the build-out of AutoNation Finance, the acquisition and rebranding of a mobile repair service (now AutoNation Mobile Service), and investments in digital omnichannel capabilities that allow customers to complete most of the vehicle purchase and service process online.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an auto retailer, AutoNation does not have traditional R&D. Its investment in this area is focused on technology and process improvements. The company's 10-K mentions the use of "proprietary tools that leverage real-time customer data to guide and personalize the customer experience," which indicates a focus on data-driven process innovation. The buildout of an end-to-end digital platform where customers can select a vehicle, apply for financing, and schedule delivery shows a commitment to modernizing the retail process. However, without specific metrics on the return from these investments, it is difficult to fully assess their effectiveness.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation focuses on a "seamless, end-to-end customer experience" through both in-store and digital channels. The company's strategy includes providing a customer-friendly, transparent sales process, which is a key differentiator in the auto retail industry. By unifying its stores under a single brand and offering programs like "We'll Buy Your Car," AutoNation has built a consistent and recognizable sales platform. The company's large scale also allows for significant investment in training and retaining sales talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, AutoNation's total gross profit margin was 17.9% and its operating margin was 4.9%. The company's higher-margin parts and service business contributed 46.2% of total gross profit, while only accounting for 17.2% of revenue. This diversified model helps to support overall profitability. While margins have moderated from recent highs due to increased new vehicle inventory, they remain significant.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation is focused on leveraging its scale to improve operating efficiency and margins. The company centralizes business processes, uses a shared service center for accounting and administrative tasks, and employs national vendor relationships to reduce costs. Additionally, the growth of the high-margin parts and service business and the expansion of AutoNation Finance are key strategies to improve the company's overall profit mix.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, AutoNation employed approximately 25,100 associates, with only about 170 covered by collective bargaining agreements. The company states a commitment to creating an environment where all associates feel valued and respected, and it conducts associate engagement surveys to gather feedback. AutoNation also offers a comprehensive benefits package, including a company-paid cancer insurance plan inspired by its "Drive Pink" initiative.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at AutoNation is composed of individuals with extensive experience in the automotive industry. CEO Michael Manley, who joined in 2021, previously served as CEO of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Other executives have long tenures at AutoNation or have held senior positions at other major automotive and industrial companies. This blend of internal and external experience suggests a strong and stable leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation has a well-defined executive team with clear responsibilities across different business segments. For example, there are separate Chief Operating Officers for the franchised and non-franchised businesses, indicating a depth of leadership. The executive team's biographies show a history of promotions from within and successful careers at other large corporations, suggesting a strong bench of talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. Management also concluded that its internal controls were effective. The company provides detailed segment reporting, which allows for a clear analysis of its different business lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's scale as one of the largest automotive retailers in the U.S. provides significant competitive advantages in purchasing power, advertising efficiency, and the ability to invest in technology. The company's unified "AutoNation" brand across most of its stores is a key differentiator in a fragmented industry. The development of a captive finance company (AutoNation Finance) allows for greater control over the customer financing process and captures additional profit, a strategy not all competitors have pursued at the same scale.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's capital allocation strategy is explicitly "focused on growing long-term value per share." AutoNation is making significant investments in strategic initiatives like AutoNation Finance, AutoNation USA stores, and AutoNation Mobile Service, which require upfront capital and may take time to reach full profitability. This willingness to invest in new business lines demonstrates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation has a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders through share repurchases rather than issuing new shares. In 2024, the company repurchased 2.9 million shares for $460.0 million. The company's "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section of the 10-K indicates that it expects to fund its operations and strategic initiatives through cash from operations, its revolving credit facility, and other debt instruments. There is no indication that the company will need to issue equity to fund its growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K provides a detailed discussion of challenges, such as the moderation of vehicle margins and the financial impact of the CDK cyber incident, which it estimated negatively impacted EPS by approximately $1.75 per share in 2024. The "Risk Factors" section is extensive and specific. A review of available earnings call transcripts shows a consistent pattern of management addressing analyst questions directly and providing detailed explanations of the company's performance and outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025), ["https://discountingcashflows.com/company/AN/transcripts/"] (2023-2025)

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates in a highly regulated industry and maintains a compliance framework. The 10-K discloses various legal proceedings, as is typical for a company of its size, but there are no disclosed issues that would suggest a lack of integrity at the senior management level. The company's independent auditors have provided unqualified opinions on its financial statements and internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000029/an-20241231.htm"] (February 14, 2025)

---
Synthesis (5–7 sentences): AutoNation scores well on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its position as a scaled, well-managed industry leader with a clear strategy for growth beyond its core business. The company's strengths lie in its diversified business model, strong brand, and disciplined capital allocation. The primary area for improvement is in demonstrating the return on its technology and digital investments. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful scaling of AutoNation Finance and the ability to maintain strong margins in the parts and service business as the vehicle market normalizes. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" on R&D Effectiveness if the company were to disclose specific metrics linking its technology investments to market share gains or improved operating efficiency.

fisher score is 14 / 15
