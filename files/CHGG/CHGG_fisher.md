Chegg, Inc. (CHGG)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Chegg, Inc. Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, filed February 24, 2025; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025, filed May 12, 2025; and recent earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chegg's core market is under significant pressure from generative AI, which has negatively impacted traffic and subscriber growth. In its 2024 10-K, the company acknowledges that technological shifts, including Google's AI Overviews and the adoption of free generative AI services, are creating headwinds and accelerating a decline in new subscribers. While Chegg is pivoting to an AI-powered platform, this move is defensive, and the market for its enhanced services is unproven against powerful, often free, alternatives from major tech companies. The company's revenue from Subscription Services decreased by 14% in 2024, and total net revenues also declined by 14%, indicating a shrinking market for its current offerings rather than a long runway for growth.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is heavily invested in integrating AI into its platform to create a more personalized and interactive user experience. The 2024 10-K states, "We continue to integrate artificial intelligence into our platform, and it is now conversational, more instructional, and interactive." This reflects a clear commitment to evolving its product in response to market disruption. Research and development expenses were $170.4 million in 2024, representing 28% of net revenues, demonstrating a continued financial commitment to product development despite declining revenues. This pivot to AI is a significant strategic shift aimed at recapturing sales potential.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chegg's R&D spending is substantial, at 24% of net revenues for the quarter ending March 31, 2025, and 28% for the full year 2024. However, the effectiveness of this spending is questionable given the company's performance. Despite significant investment in an AI-powered platform, the company reports that these initiatives have "not attracted as many new students as anticipated" and that "business has been adversely affected." Subscriber numbers continue to fall, with a 14% decrease in 2024 and a 31% decrease in the three months ended March 31, 2025, indicating that R&D efforts have not yet successfully countered competitive threats from generative AI.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chegg's business model is primarily direct-to-consumer, relying on performance and brand marketing rather than a traditional sales force. Sales and marketing expenses were 21% of net revenues in the first quarter of 2025. However, the results indicate these efforts are not "above-average" in the current environment. Global non-subscriber traffic to the site has seen accelerating year-over-year declines, reaching a 49% decline in January 2025. The company's subscriber base fell from 7.7 million in 2023 to 6.6 million in 2024. This demonstrates a significant challenge in attracting and converting users effectively.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chegg's gross profit margin has historically been strong, but is now under pressure. For the full year 2024, gross margin was 71%, an increase from 68% in 2023. However, for the first quarter of 2025, gross margin fell sharply to 56% from 73% in the same period of 2024, primarily due to accelerated depreciation as the company streamlined product experiences. The company recorded a loss from operations of $29.0 million in Q1 2025, compared to a loss of $2.5 million in Q1 2024, showing a significant deterioration in operating profitability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to improve margins through significant cost reductions. The company initiated restructuring plans in June 2024 and November 2024, which included reducing its global workforce by approximately 22%. A further restructuring plan was announced in May 2025 to further streamline operations. These actions are intended to "better align our cost structure with recent industry challenges" and realize cost savings in fiscal years 2025 and 2026. These measures demonstrate a clear focus on improving profitability in response to revenue pressures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has undertaken multiple rounds of significant workforce reductions, cutting approximately 22% of its staff through restructuring plans in June and November 2024. Another restructuring was announced in May 2025. While layoffs are a response to business challenges, they can negatively impact morale and relations with remaining employees. The 2024 10-K notes the implementation of a short-term retention cash bonus plan to "attract and retain a highly engaged workforce," suggesting a potential risk of attrition. While the company has received awards for its workplace culture, the scale and frequency of recent layoffs suggest that personnel relations are likely strained.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company appointed a new CEO in 2024, Nathan Schultz, who has been with the company for 16 years in various leadership roles, indicating a degree of internal succession and stability. However, the company is currently undergoing a strategic review process announced in February 2025 to explore alternatives, including being acquired or going private. Such reviews, combined with significant business challenges and stock price declines, can create uncertainty and strain among the executive team. The need to implement multiple restructuring plans also points to a challenging operating environment for the leadership team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s 2024 10-K and proxy statements list an executive team beyond the CEO, including a Chief Financial Officer and Chief Technology Officer, responsible for key operational areas. The promotion of Nathan Schultz to CEO after 16 years with the company suggests the presence of a leadership pipeline and long-tenured executives with deep institutional knowledge. However, the ongoing strategic review and significant business model pivot required to combat AI threats will test the full depth and capability of the entire management team. The information available in filings confirms a formal management structure is in place.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chegg's external auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company’s financial statements provide a detailed breakdown of revenues by segment (Subscription Services and Skills and Other) and geography, as well as a breakdown of operating expenses. There is no evidence of material weaknesses, recent restatements, or major accounting controversies. Management’s discussion and analysis details specific cost drivers and restructuring charges, suggesting adequate cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key clue in the EdTech industry is the ownership of a proprietary and vast content library, which Chegg possesses with over a hundred million pieces of learning content. This was historically a significant competitive advantage. However, the rise of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, which can generate educational content instantly, has severely eroded the value of this moat. The company itself notes that "students see generative AI products like Chat GPT and others as strong alternatives to vertically specialized solutions for education such as Chegg," indicating its historical advantage is no longer sufficient to make it outstanding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary and actions demonstrate a focus on long-term survival and eventual return to growth, even at the cost of short-term results. The company is making substantial investments in AI integration, which negatively impacts current profitability, with the stated belief that "the investments we are making will allow us to return to revenue growth over time." Furthermore, the decision to undertake a strategic review process to "maximize shareholder value" indicates a willingness to consider all long-term options, including those that disrupt the near-term business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Chegg's liquidity has tightened considerably, with cash, cash equivalents, and investments totaling $126.4 million, down from $528.4 million at year-end 2024, largely due to repayment of convertible notes. The company generated positive net cash from operations of $24.5 million in Q1 2025. While the company has a securities repurchase program, its focus is now on restructuring and navigating a difficult transition. Given the significant net loss and business pressures, the ability to fund growth without future equity financing is not assured, especially if the strategic review does not result in a favorable transaction.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has been candid about the severe challenges facing the business. The "Business Updates and Developments" section in the MD&A of recent filings openly discusses the negative impacts of Google's AI Overviews and the increased adoption of generative AI by students. The company explicitly states these factors "have negatively impacted our industry and our business and are expected to continue to impact our overall traffic and accelerate the decline in the number of new subscribers." This level of transparent disclosure about existential threats in primary filings and earnings calls demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000013/chgg-20241231.htm) (February 24, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chegg is involved in several legal proceedings, including a stockholder derivative complaint and a securities fraud class action. The securities class action alleges that officers made materially false and misleading statements between May 2020 and November 2021; the company reached a settlement in principle for $55.0 million while denying any wrongdoing. Additionally, the FTC finalized a consent order in January 2023 regarding Chegg's privacy and data security practices and is investigating whether Chegg has violated its terms. This pattern of legal and regulatory issues raises questions about management's practices and integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1364954/000136495425000052/chgg-20250331.htm) (May 12, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Chegg scores poorly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a business facing existential threats from technological disruption. The company's strongest positives are its commitment to pivoting its product through R&D, its clear-eyed cost-cutting measures to preserve margins, and its candor with investors about the severe headwinds it faces. However, these are overshadowed by profound negatives: a collapsing market runway for its legacy products, ineffective R&D spending to date in terms of reversing subscriber declines, deteriorating profit margins, and legal/regulatory issues that question management's integrity. The most critical variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its AI-powered platform in gaining traction with students and the outcome of its strategic review. A "No" on "Products/Services with Long Runway" would flip to "Yes" with evidence of sustained subscriber growth and stabilizing revenue. A "No" on "R&D Effectiveness" would flip with data showing the new AI product is successfully converting and retaining users at a profitable rate.

**fisher score is 5 / 15**
