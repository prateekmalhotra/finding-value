**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, HOKA brand net sales grew 23.6% to $2.23 billion, and UGG brand net sales grew 13.1% to $2.53 billion. The company is executing a global expansion strategy, with international sales increasing 26.3% in fiscal 2025.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deckers maintains a formal product creation process that begins with consumer insights, trend research, and in-depth market analysis. The company's design and development teams work closely with brand management to create seasonal product lines. Evidence of this commitment includes the diversification of the UGG product line beyond its seasonal core and the extension of the HOKA brand from its ultra-runner origins to a broad range of performance and lifestyle footwear. This structured approach to innovation demonstrates a clear commitment to developing new products to fuel future sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year 2025, Deckers reported research and development costs of $56.7 million on net sales of $4.99 billion, which is approximately 1.1% of revenue. While this percentage is lower than some larger competitors like Nike and Adidas, the exceptional growth of the HOKA brand, which is built on product innovation (enhanced cushioning and stability), demonstrates high R&D effectiveness. The brand's rapid expansion from a niche product to a major force in performance footwear suggests a strong return on its R&D investment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deckers utilizes a robust multi-channel sales approach that is delivering strong results across the board. In fiscal 2025, the wholesale channel grew 17.4% to $2.86 billion, while the Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel grew 14.8% to $2.13 billion. The company's ability to drive significant growth in both its wholesale partnerships with top-tier retailers and its own e-commerce and retail stores, both domestically and internationally (+26.3% growth), points to a highly effective and well-executed sales strategy.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deckers has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, the company's gross margin increased by 230 basis points to 57.9%, and its operating margin increased by 200 basis points to 23.6%. These margins are robust for the footwear and apparel industry and indicate strong brand pricing power and efficient operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's fiscal 2025 gross margin improvement was driven by a favorable brand and product mix, with higher-margin products accounting for a greater proportion of sales. Deckers also benefited from "increased levels of full-price selling primarily for the UGG brand, including reduced closeouts to the wholesale channel." This demonstrates a focus on disciplined inventory management, brand heat that commands full price, and a strategic shift towards more profitable sales.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deckers' 10-K filing details significant investment in human capital. The company highlights its culture and values, and a February 2025 employee survey with a 91.5% participation rate showed that 89% of respondents were proud to work for Deckers. It offers competitive compensation, talent development programs like "Explore Week," and leadership mentoring. There is no mention of strikes, unionization disputes, or other significant labor problems in the filing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team and board appear stable, with a clear commitment to long-term strategy. The 10-K states, "our executive leadership team and Board commit substantial time to succession planning, evaluating the bench strength of our leadership and supporting their career development while improving organizational performance." This structured approach to leadership and succession suggests a healthy and professional relationship among senior executives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent operational and strategic success across multiple brands (UGG and HOKA) and channels (DTC and Wholesale) implies a strong layer of management beneath the CEO. The 10-K for fiscal year 2025 was signed by a CEO, CFO, and a Chair of the Board, along with several other directors. The company's ability to manage the distinct brand identities and rapid growth of both UGG and HOKA suggests capable leadership at the brand president level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 10-K filing for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025, Deckers' management concluded that its "disclosure controls and procedures are effective at a reasonable assurance level." Furthermore, the independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company's recent change in segment reporting to a brand-focused structure (UGG, HOKA, Other) also provides clearer insight into business performance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deckers' key competitive advantage lies in its demonstrated ability to build and scale powerful, distinct brands that command high margins. The resurgence and expansion of UGG and the explosive growth of HOKA showcase a rare capability in the trend-driven footwear industry. The company's success in growing its DTC channel to over $2.1 billion provides a direct relationship with the consumer and greater control over brand presentation and profitability, a crucial advantage over competitors heavily reliant on wholesale.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in the 10-K indicates a focus on long-term brand health and market expansion over short-term profit maximization. The company outlines significant continued investment in marketing to "drive global brand awareness and market share gains" and strategic spending on expanding the HOKA retail footprint and global supply chain infrastructure. This pattern of reinvesting in core assets like brand equity and distribution capabilities is a hallmark of a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Deckers' financial position is exceptionally strong. As of March 31, 2025, the company had $1.89 billion in cash and cash equivalents and no significant debt. The company generated over $1.04 billion in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2025. Furthermore, Deckers is actively returning capital to shareholders, having repurchased $567 million of its common stock in fiscal 2025 and authorizing an additional $2.25 billion for repurchase in May 2025. This financial strength and commitment to buybacks virtually eliminates the risk of dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K includes an extensive and detailed "Risk Factors" section that candidly discusses a wide array of potential challenges, from changing consumer preferences and supply chain disruptions to cybersecurity threats and reliance on key personnel. This level of disclosure demonstrates a high degree of transparency with investors about the risks inherent in the business. Reviewing earnings call transcripts further reveals a management team that provides detailed explanations for performance drivers, both positive and negative.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the company's SEC filings of significant legal or regulatory issues that would call management's integrity into question. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 10-K primarily discusses actions the company initiates to protect its intellectual property, which is a normal course of business. The company maintains standard corporate governance structures, including an Audit & Risk Management Committee, and its independent auditor has issued clean opinions on its financial statements and internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/910521/000091052125000017/deck-20250331.htm) (Filed May 23, 2025)

**Synthesis**
Deckers Outdoor Corporation scores exceptionally well against Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a business with powerful brands, strong growth, high profitability, and a sound financial and operational footing. The primary strengths are the powerful brand momentum of HOKA and UGG, which provides a long runway for growth, and a robust financial profile that allows for significant reinvestment and shareholder returns without risk of dilution. All 15 points were answered with "Yes," indicating a high-quality organization from a Fisher perspective. The variables most likely to change this score in the next 12–24 months would be a faltering of the strong growth trajectory of the HOKA brand or an inability to maintain the fashion relevance and pricing power of the UGG brand. Evidence of slowing growth in key segments, margin compression due to competitive pressure, or a major product misstep would be required to flip any "Yes" answers to "No".

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
