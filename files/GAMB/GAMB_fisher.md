### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong balance sheet with cash and cash equivalents of $32.4 million as of March 31, 2024. The company also generates strong free cash flow. In the earnout agreement for the BonusFinder acquisition, the company has the option to pay up to 50% of each of the earnout payments in unregistered ordinary shares. This suggests that while the company has the option to use equity, it is not reliant on it.

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q1 2024 earnings release, the company updated its full-year guidance downward due to changes in how Google treats commercial content. This demonstrates a willingness to be transparent with investors when facing challenges.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Gambling.com Group scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market opportunity, business model, and profitability. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the continued growth of the online gambling industry, and its portfolio of premium domain names provides a significant competitive advantage. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of information on several key points, including R&D effectiveness, labor relations, and management depth. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with greater transparency on these issues. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" on R&D effectiveness with more disclosure on technology investments and their impact on the business. Similarly, more information on the company's culture and management team beyond the CEO and CFO would be needed to change the scores on labor relations and management depth. The recent downward revision to guidance due to changes in Google's algorithm is a key risk to monitor.

fisher score is 9 / 15
