Clarus Corporation, August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024; Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clarus operates in the outdoor and adventure sports markets, which are supported by favorable long-term trends like the increasing adoption of outdoor lifestyles and the rise of overlanding. The company's growth strategy includes expanding its Adventure brands, such as Rhino-Rack, into the U.S. and European markets where it currently holds less than 1% market share. However, recent performance shows significant weakness; sales for the six months ended June 30, 2025, decreased 8.0% year-over-year, with declines in both the Outdoor and Adventure segments due to challenging wholesale markets and lower OEM demand.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a stated growth strategy of creating innovative new products and acquiring complementary businesses. This is evidenced by the recent acquisitions of TRED Outdoors (October 2023) and RockyMounts (December 2024), which expand the portfolio in the Adventure segment. The company’s Black Diamond brand has a long history of technical innovation and received over 250 product awards in 2024 alone, indicating a strong and ongoing product development pipeline.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, Clarus invested $12.2 million in research and development, representing approximately 4.6% of its $264.3 million in sales. The effectiveness of this spending, particularly for the Black Diamond brand, is demonstrated by the receipt of over 250 product awards in 2024. This level of industry recognition suggests a highly effective R&D process that successfully brings innovative and award-winning products to market, which is strong for a company of its size.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clarus has a global sales organization deployed by geographic region, marketing its products in over 50 countries through a multi-channel approach that includes specialty retail, distributors, OEMs, and a direct-to-consumer website. However, recent results indicate significant challenges. Sales for the six months ended June 30, 2025, declined 8.0%, with weakness across both domestic and international markets, including challenging wholesale markets and lower OEM demand. An above-average sales organization would likely demonstrate more resilience or pockets of strength amidst these challenges.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the six months ended June 30, 2025, Clarus’s gross margin was 35.0%, down from 36.0% in the prior year. The company reported a consolidated operating loss of $17.7 million for the first six months of 2025, following a $70.4 million operating loss for the full fiscal year 2024 (which included significant goodwill and intangible asset impairments). A consistent inability to generate operating profits, regardless of the cause, indicates that current profit margins are not worthwhile.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is executing several initiatives to improve profitability. Since 2023, the company has been implementing a restructuring plan that includes employee reductions and facility rationalization. It is also pursuing a "product simplification and SKU rationalization strategy" within the Outdoor segment to improve product mix. Furthermore, Clarus is actively managing its brand portfolio by divesting businesses, such as the Precision Sport segment (February 2024) and the PIEPS brand (July 2025), to focus resources on more profitable areas.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Clarus had approximately 470 employees, none of whom are represented by a union. The company's 10-K report states, "We believe that our employee relations are good." However, this is a generic statement, and the company has been actively reducing its workforce as part of a restructuring plan that began in 2023. Without positive, verifiable evidence of "outstanding" relations, such as employee satisfaction awards or independently verified low turnover rates, the standard disclosure combined with recent layoffs does not meet the high bar of this criterion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's board of directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 22.2% of outstanding common stock as of March 6, 2025. This substantial insider ownership, particularly by Executive Chairman Warren B. Kanders, creates a strong alignment of interests between the management team and shareholders. This alignment is a key indicator of outstanding executive relations, as leadership's financial success is directly tied to the company's performance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's SEC filings primarily identify the Executive Chairman, Warren B. Kanders, and the Chief Financial Officer, Michael J. Yates, as the principal executive officers. Public disclosures do not provide significant detail on the broader management team, such as the presidents or leaders of the key Black Diamond and Adventure segments. Without clear evidence of a deep bench of operating leaders beyond the top executive level, it is difficult to confirm that the company has sufficient management depth to mitigate key-person risk and manage its diverse brands effectively.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Clarus's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and its internal control over financial reporting. Management also concluded in its most recent quarterly report that its disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of June 30, 2025. The company provides financial reporting broken down by its two primary operating segments, Outdoor and Adventure, which allows for reasonable cost and profitability analysis by investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the outdoor equipment industry, brand authenticity and a reputation for innovation and safety are critical competitive advantages. Clarus's portfolio is built on this principle, led by the Black Diamond brand, which has been an iconic innovator in climbing and skiing since 1957. The company's other key brands are also leaders in their respective niches, such as MAXTRAX being the creator of the vehicle recovery board. This deep-rooted authenticity and "first mover" advantage in core product categories provide a significant competitive moat that is difficult for rivals to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is currently executing a multi-year restructuring program and actively divesting non-core or underperforming assets, including its Precision Sport segment and PIEPS brand. These actions incur significant short-term costs—such as severance, transaction expenses, and impairment charges—with the explicit goal of improving the company's long-term growth and profitability profile. This willingness to absorb immediate financial pain to reshape the company for future success is strong evidence of a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Following the sale of its Precision Sport segment, Clarus paid off all outstanding borrowings under its credit facility and was debt-free as of December 31, 2024. The company explicitly plans to fund its activities through operating cash flow and proceeds from this sale. Although free cash flow was negative for the first half of 2025, the company maintains a strong balance sheet with $28.5 million in cash and minimal debt as of June 30, 2025. This solid financial position significantly mitigates the risk of needing to issue dilutive equity for the foreseeable future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a high degree of candor regarding its most significant challenge. In its SEC filings, Clarus provides extensive detail about the ongoing investigations by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Department of Justice regarding its avalanche transceivers. It explicitly states the CPSC staff's conclusion that the company "failed to timely meet its statutory reporting obligations" and "made a material misrepresentation," as well as the specific civil penalties recommended. This level of transparency about a deeply negative event is a strong indicator of management's commitment to candid communication.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025009892/clar-20250630x10q.htm (Filed July 31, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is currently under investigation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the U.S. Department of Justice. The CPSC staff concluded that the company "failed to timely meet its statutory reporting obligations" regarding safety issues with certain avalanche transceivers and "made a material misrepresentation in a report to the CPSC." On January 23, 2025, the company was served with grand jury subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office related to these products. An active DOJ investigation and a regulatory finding of "material misrepresentation" directly call management's integrity into question.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/913277/000155837025002405/clar-20241231x10k.htm (Filed March 6, 2025)

---
Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
Clarus Corporation's primary strengths lie in its portfolio of authentic, iconic brands and a management team that is heavily invested and taking decisive, long-term actions to reshape the business. The company maintains a strong, debt-free balance sheet and is candid with investors about its challenges. However, these positives are overshadowed by significant negatives, including persistent sales declines, operating losses, and a serious regulatory investigation into product safety reporting that directly questions management's integrity. The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the resolution of the CPSC/DOJ investigations and a return to profitable, organic sales growth. A favorable settlement with regulators would be required to flip the "No" on integrity to a "Yes," while a sustained turnaround in sales and a return to operating profitability would be needed to change the scores for its growth runway and margins.
