### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom operates in the large Human Capital Management (HCM) market and is actively expanding its addressable market. The company is targeting larger clients (organizations with over 1,000 employees) and expanding internationally, having already launched payroll services in Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, with plans for further additions. Domestically, Paycom sees a significant opportunity to increase penetration in existing markets; as of its 2024 10-K, it had a sales office in 41 of the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan statistical areas, but only seven of these were served by more than one sales team. This multi-faceted growth strategy—targeting larger customers, expanding geographically, and increasing density in current markets—provides a long runway for future sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom demonstrates a clear commitment to ongoing product development through both stated strategy and financial investment. The company's 2024 10-K explicitly includes "Maintain Our Leadership in Innovation by Strengthening and Extending our Solution" as a core growth strategy, noting that development is performed exclusively in-house and is heavily based on client input. This is supported by rising R&D expenditures, which increased 23.4% to $62.3 million in the first quarter of 2025 compared to the same period in 2024. The consistent rollout of new, internally developed applications, such as the industry-first Beti® technology that allows employees to do their own payroll, exemplifies this commitment to innovation.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom's R&D efforts appear highly effective, characterized by significant investment and productive output. The company's R&D spending was approximately 12.9% of revenue in 2024 and 11.7% in Q1 2025, a substantial reinvestment rate. Paycom attributes its R&D productivity to its proprietary, cloud-based architecture and the strategic location of its development teams in Oklahoma and Texas, which it believes provides high-quality talent at a lower cost. The effectiveness of this spending is evident in its single-database software platform and the development of innovative, fully integrated products like Beti®, which creates a competitive differentiator and enhances the value of its entire suite.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom utilizes a direct, internally trained sales force operating from 58 sales teams across 29 states as of the end of 2024. The company has a structured training program for its sales representatives, which includes instruction in accounting, business metrics, and tax matters relevant to its target market. However, the company's annual revenue retention rate has been 90% for 2023 and 2024, down from 91% in 2022. While the sales force is extensive and well-trained, the slight decline in retention and recent revenue growth pressures suggest the organization is facing challenges, preventing a clear "Yes."
**Answer:** No

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom consistently generates high profit margins. For the fiscal year 2024, the company reported an operating margin of 33.7% and a net income margin of 26.7%. In the first quarter of 2025, operating margin was 34.9% and net income margin was 26.3%. These margins are robust and demonstrate the profitability and scalability of its SaaS business model.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom is focused on leveraging automation and driving employee usage of its platform to create efficiencies that support margins. The company's vision is that "people should not perform payroll- and HCM-related tasks that systems can safely automate," as exemplified by its Beti technology. By empowering employees to manage their own data, the platform reduces administrative burden and errors, lowering service costs. In its 2024 10-K, the company states it is leveraging "automation and other internal efficiencies" to offset historical increases in employee headcount and facility costs, in an effort to expand margins.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom's 2024 10-K details its human capital objectives, which include attracting, developing, and retaining top talent. The company offers comprehensive health insurance, a 401(k) match, an employee stock purchase plan, and paid leave. It highlights its five core values: We Innovate, We Win, We Care, We Serve, We Believe. As of December 31, 2024, none of its 7,306 employees were represented by a union. While the company provides positive commentary, without independent, verifiable metrics on employee turnover or satisfaction (e.g., third-party surveys or detailed attrition data), it's difficult to confirm "outstanding" relations.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is led by its founder, Chad Richison, who has been CEO since 1998, indicating stability at the highest level. The 10-K notes a dependence on key executives, including Mr. Richison, and highlights the importance of effective succession planning. While long tenure at the top can be a positive sign of stability, there is no specific disclosure on the broader executive team's relations or detailed succession plans, making it difficult to assess this point as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom's public filings primarily focus on the leadership of its founder and CEO, Chad Richison, and its CFO, Craig Boelte. The 2024 10-K explicitly states, "We are dependent on the leadership of our key executives," and that the "loss of their leadership, expertise and experience could adversely impact our operations." While the company undoubtedly has other managers, there is limited public disclosure about the depth of the management team beyond the top executives or specific details on succession planning. This concentration of visible leadership suggests a potential key-person risk.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom's independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO framework. The company also voluntarily obtains SOC 1 and SOC 2 examinations, which address internal controls over financial reporting, security, and data privacy. This external validation and lack of any disclosed material weaknesses in recent filings indicate that the company has effective and reliable accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom's key competitive advantage in the SaaS HCM industry is its single-database architecture. The 2024 10-K emphasizes that because its solution was developed in-house on a single platform, clients do not need to integrate, update, or access multiple databases, which are common issues with competitors who often use third-party systems. This architecture provides a "core system of record" that enhances data integrity, enables real-time analytics, and serves as the foundation for innovations like Beti. This technological foundation creates a significant moat and a more seamless user experience, which is a crucial differentiator in the HCM software space.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom consistently invests a significant portion of its revenue into R&D and sales and marketing to support long-term growth. In 2024, R&D and Sales & Marketing expenses were 12.9% and 23.1% of revenue, respectively. Management's discussion emphasizes long-term focused investments in automation, client ROI, and service to strengthen revenue growth and retention. This sustained, high level of reinvestment in product innovation and market expansion, even while maintaining strong profitability, demonstrates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Paycom has a strong financial position, generating significant cash flow from operations ($533.9 million in 2024). As of March 31, 2025, the company had $520.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and no outstanding debt under its $1.0 billion revolving credit facility. Furthermore, the company has an active stock repurchase plan, with $1.47 billion remaining available for repurchases as of March 31, 2025, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them. This strong balance sheet, cash generation, and share buyback program indicate it can fund growth without needing to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management openly discusses challenges and strategic shifts in its public communications. For example, in the 2024 10-K, the company acknowledges that its industry-first Beti technology, while a strategic success, has "experienced a reduction in these activities that historically would otherwise generate additional revenue for us" by eliminating billable corrections. This is a candid admission of a product cannibalizing a legacy revenue stream for a better long-term model. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, executives addressed the "macro pressures" and the "headwind" from lower-margin revenues that were impacted by their new products, demonstrating transparency about business challenges.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of Paycom's recent SEC filings does not reveal any material governance red flags, related-party transactions, or audit issues. The 2024 10-K states that the company's independent auditor's report on internal controls was unqualified. However, the 10-K does disclose that between November 2023 and January 2024, four federal securities class-action lawsuits were filed against the company and its top executives alleging materially false and misleading statements regarding the impact of its Beti product on revenues. While the company believes the claims are without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously, the existence of such litigation against top management prevents an unqualified "Yes" on this point.
**Answer:** No

Synthesis:
Paycom scores positively on many of Fisher’s points, reflecting its strong product foundation, high profitability, and commitment to innovation. The company's primary strengths lie in its single-database architecture, which provides a significant competitive advantage, and its consistent reinvestment in R&D to widen that moat. Its financial health is excellent, with high margins, strong cash flow, and a commitment to share repurchases over dilution. The primary weaknesses identified are a lack of disclosed management depth beyond key executives, a recent dip in the revenue retention rate, and ongoing securities litigation that calls management's integrity into question, at least legally. Over the next 12–24 months, the score would most likely be impacted by the resolution of the securities litigation; a favorable outcome would flip point 15 to "Yes." Additionally, an improvement in the annual revenue retention rate back above 91% and evidence of successful market penetration with larger clients would be key evidence to change the "No" on its sales organization to a "Yes."

fisher score is 10 / 15
