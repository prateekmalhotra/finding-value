**Reasoning & Evidence:** Copart's business model benefits from significant network effects.

---
**Synthesis:**
Copart scores highly on the Fisher checklist, with its primary strengths being its dominant market position, strong profitability, and excellent financial health. The company's business model benefits from durable competitive advantages, including network effects and ownership of its physical infrastructure. The most likely factors to change the score in the next 12-24 months would be a significant shift in the frequency of total loss accidents, increased competition from new entrants, or a major misstep in its international expansion strategy. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be changed to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosure from the company on its technology investments and their impact on the business. Similarly, a more proactive disclosure of employee metrics could change the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes."

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
