### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** StoneCo is a leader in the Brazilian fintech market, which is projected to grow annually at over 15% through 2033. The company is effectively capturing this growth by expanding its core client base of micro, small, and medium-sized businesses (MSMBs), which grew 17% year-over-year to 4.5 million in Q2 2025. Beyond payments, StoneCo is successfully cross-selling banking and credit solutions, with active banking clients growing 2.3x year-over-year to 2.8 million and its credit portfolio expanding 2.5x in the same period, indicating a long runway for growth within its existing client base.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has explicitly stated its strategy is the "integration of financial services and software, providing a comprehensive suite of solutions to our merchants." This is demonstrated by the rapid scaling of its banking and credit offerings alongside its core payments business. The company also divested certain non-core software assets in July 2025 to sharpen its focus on this integrated strategy. This focus on building a comprehensive financial ecosystem for merchants, rather than just focusing on payments, shows a clear commitment to future development.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/STNE/transcripts/2025/2/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/STNE/transcripts/2025/2/) (August 8, 2025), [https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms](https.www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms) (August 19, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While StoneCo's successful product expansion into banking and credit signals effective development, specific data on R&D expenditure as a percentage of revenue could not be located in the available sources. Without quantitative metrics to compare its R&D spending and output against peers, it is not possible to verify the effectiveness relative to its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** StoneCo's differentiated go-to-market strategy relies on a proprietary network of "Stone Hubs" for local sales and in-person support, which is a key advantage in the SME market. This model has driven consistent, above-market client growth, with the MSMB client base reaching 4.5 million active payment clients in Q2 2025, a 17% year-over-year increase. The ability to consistently grow its client base at a rapid pace points to a highly effective sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, StoneCo demonstrates strong profitability. In its Q2 2025 results, the company reported a return on equity of 22% at the consolidated level and 30% for its core financial services segment. The adjusted EBT (Earnings Before Taxes) margin for the same quarter was a healthy 28.5%. These figures indicate a high level of profitability relative to its operations.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through several initiatives. This includes strategic repricing to balance growth and profitability and a shift to cheaper, deposit-based funding for its credit operations. Furthermore, the company has divested non-core, lower-margin software assets to streamline operations and focus on its highly profitable financial services core.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms](https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms) (August 19, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is insufficient publicly available information to make a definitive judgment on the quality of labor and personnel relations. While the company's growth implies a scaling of its workforce, specific metrics on employee attrition, engagement, or union relations were not found in the reviewed financial reports, transcripts, or reputable news sources.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has undergone significant management and board changes, including a new CEO in March 2023 and a planned transition of the Chairman and Vice-Chairman in April 2024. While these transitions appear to have been orderly, the average board tenure is low (3 years), suggesting a "new board." This level of change at the highest levels, while potentially positive for the future, prevents a confident "Yes" until the new leadership team establishes a longer track record of stability and cohesion.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company discloses a full C-suite beyond the CEO, including a CFO, COO, CTO, Chief Legal Officer, Chief Strategy & Marketing Officer, and Chief Risk Officer. The presence of named heads for key operating segments like Banking and Credit further suggests a distributed leadership structure. This indicates sufficient management depth beyond a single key executive.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The available information from the company's risk factors indicates that "in the past, we identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting." While the company is working to remediate this, the historical presence of a material weakness prevents an unqualified "Yes." There have been no recent restatements found, and the auditor's review of the Q2 2024 financials did not raise issues, but the historical weakness requires caution.
**Answer:** No

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** StoneCo's key competitive advantage is its hybrid distribution model combining a proprietary, cloud-based technology platform with a physical network of "Stone Hubs." This allows for high-touch, in-person sales and support, which is a significant differentiator for the underserved SME segment in Brazil compared to purely digital competitors or incumbent banks. Leveraging its vast transaction data to inform its own credit underwriting also provides a data-driven advantage over traditional lenders.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is pursuing a balanced approach, but the emphasis is on durable, profitable growth. In August 2025, the company raised its full-year EPS growth guidance from 18% to 32%, demonstrating a focus on near-term profitability. However, its continued investment in scaling newer initiatives like banking and credit, and its strategy of building an integrated ecosystem, indicate a long-range view toward building sustainable revenue streams rather than maximizing short-term profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms](https.www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms) (August 19, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, with close to zero net debt and a robust gross profit margin of 73% over the last twelve months. More significantly, management is actively returning capital to shareholders, with a R$2 billion share buyback program underway. This action, combined with strong internal cash generation, signals that the company is more than capable of funding its growth without needing to issue shares and dilute existing owners.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms](https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms) (August 19, 2025), [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stoneco-ltd-reports-voting-results-of-shareholder-meeting-3559388](https.www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/stoneco-ltd-reports-voting-results-of-shareholder-meeting-3559388) (April 23, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company maintains a regular cadence of quarterly earnings calls and provides detailed financial outlooks, including upwardly revising guidance in Q2 2025. However, one available report noted that a cash and cash equivalents figure came in below analyst estimates, and the "company provided no explicit explanation in the earnings call." This instance of a lack of proactive explanation on a key variance prevents a clear "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms](https://www.finimize.com/content/stoneco-delivers-strong-growth-as-brazils-fintech-booms) (August 19, 2025), [https://www.streetinsider.com/Globe+Newswire/StoneCos+Q1+2025+Earnings%3A+Growth+Amid+Regulatory+Rigor+in+Brazils+Fintech+Landscape/23204903.html](https://www.streetinsider.com/Globe+Newswire/StoneCos+Q1+2025+Earnings%3A+Growth+Amid+Regulatory+Rigor+in+Brazils+Fintech+Landscape/23204903.html) (May 8, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags such as major lawsuits, regulatory actions, or executive scandals noted in the recent, publicly available information. The company's financial statements are audited by Ernst & Young, a major accounting firm. While no evidence of a lack of integrity was found, this is a very high bar. The previously disclosed material weakness in internal controls, while an accounting issue and not an integrity one, reflects on overall governance and prevents an unqualified "Yes".
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://mziq.com/sec/0001193125-24-197609#d764789d6k_htm-a764789_42](https://mziq.com/sec/0001193125-24-197609#d764789d6k_htm-a764789_42) (August 14, 2024)

---
Synthesis:
StoneCo scores well on Fisher's criteria related to market opportunity, business strategy, and financial strength. The company has a long growth runway in the Brazilian SME market and a differentiated strategy through its "Stone Hubs" that drives strong client acquisition and impressive, improving profit margins. Its balance sheet is robust, underscored by a significant share buyback program that eliminates near-term dilution risk. The primary weaknesses and areas for improvement center on governance and transparency. Recent and ongoing turnover in top leadership and the board, coupled with a previously disclosed material weakness in accounting controls, suggest a need for a period of stability and execution to prove itself. The score would most likely improve in the next 12-24 months if the new management team demonstrates stable, cohesive leadership, resolves the historical internal control weakness, and improves its proactive communication with investors regarding financial variances.

fisher score is 9 / 15
