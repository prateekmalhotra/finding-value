### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** 2025 Restructuring Plan

*   **Type:** Operational / Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On May 15, 2024, the Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan to improve profitability and cash flow. This plan was increased on September 5, 2024, to an estimated $140 million to $160 million in charges to be incurred during fiscal 2025 and 2026.
*   **Mechanism:** The restructuring plan is designed to reduce the company's cost base, which should lead to improved operating margins and profitability. This, in turn, would increase earnings per share and potentially lead to a higher stock valuation.
*   **Timing:** The majority of the restructuring charges are expected to be incurred in fiscal year 2025 (ending March 31, 2026).
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company achieves the low end of the cost savings from the restructuring, resulting in a 50 basis point improvement in operating margin.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company achieves a 100 basis point improvement in operating margin.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company achieves a 150 basis point improvement in operating margin.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-30% (Medium). A 100-150 basis point improvement in operating margin on roughly $5.7 billion in annual revenue (based on fiscal 2024 revenue) could add $57-$85 million in operating income, which would be a significant boost to the company's bottom line.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The plan has been approved by the board and is already in motion. The risk lies in the execution and the realization of the expected benefits.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful execution of the plan, including employee severance, facility closures, and other transformational initiatives, without disrupting the company's core operations.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly restructuring charges reported in the 10-Q.
    *   Updates on the restructuring plan in earnings calls.
    *   Changes in operating margin in subsequent financial reports.
    *   Employee turnover and morale.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The restructuring could disrupt operations and negatively impact sales.
    *   The expected cost savings may not materialize.
    *   The company may have to increase the size and cost of the restructuring plan.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the company's progress on the restructuring plan and its impact on profitability.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On May 15, 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program of up to $500 million of the company's Class C Common Stock through May 31, 2027. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $460.0 million remained available under the program.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share. This can also signal management's confidence in the company's future prospects and provide support for the stock price.
*   **Timing:** The program is authorized through May 31, 2027, with repurchases likely to occur opportunistically over the next 0-12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $100 million of stock over the next 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $200 million of stock over the next 12 months.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company repurchases $300 million of stock over the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 0-10% (Small). At the current market capitalization, this program is not large enough to have a major impact on the share price, but it will provide some support and boost EPS.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The program has been authorized, and the company has already begun to execute on it.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company's cash flow must be sufficient to fund the repurchases without compromising other strategic initiatives.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in the 10-Q.
    *   Cash flow from operations.
    *   Total shares outstanding.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The company may suspend the program if cash flow weakens.
    *   The repurchases may not be accretive if done at too high a price.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The share repurchase program provides a degree of downside protection and is a positive signal.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Insider Purchases

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In August 2025, multiple directors of the company made significant open-market purchases of the company's stock. This includes purchases of 100,000 shares each by directors Robert John Sweeney, Mohamed El-Erian, and Dawn N. Fitzpatrick.
*   **Mechanism:** Insider purchases are often seen as a strong signal of confidence in the company's future prospects from those who know the company best. This can attract other investors and drive the share price higher.
*   **Timing:** The signal from these purchases is immediate, though the full impact on investor sentiment may take several months to play out.
*   **Quantification:** The total value of the purchases by the three directors in August 2025 was over $1.5 million.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 0-10% (Small). While a strong positive signal, the absolute size of the purchases is not large enough to have a major impact on the stock's valuation on its own.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 100%. The purchases have already occurred and been reported.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The positive signal from the insider purchases needs to be followed by improving company performance to have a lasting impact.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Further insider buying or selling activity on OpenInsider.
    *   The company's next earnings report and forward guidance.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The positive signal could be negated by a poor earnings report.
    *   The directors may have personal reasons for buying the stock that are not related to their outlook for the company.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is a strong positive signal from insiders that the stock may be undervalued.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Return to Profitable Growth in North America

*   **Type:** Operational / Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has been facing a challenging retail environment in North America, with revenue in the region declining 13.5% in the six months ended September 30, 2024. A return to growth in this key market would be a major long-term catalyst.
*   **Mechanism:** North America is the company's largest market. A return to growth would significantly boost overall revenue and profitability, leading to a higher stock valuation.
*   **Timing:** 12-36 months. A turnaround in a major market like this will take time and successful execution of new strategies.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company stabilizes North American revenue.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company returns to low-single-digit growth in North America.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company achieves mid-single-digit growth in North America.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** >30% (Large). A return to sustained, profitable growth in the company's core market would fundamentally change the investment thesis for the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 40%. This is a challenging task in a competitive market, and there is no clear evidence yet of a turnaround.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Successful new product launches that resonate with consumers.
    *   Improved marketing and brand positioning.
    *   A more stable macroeconomic environment.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly revenue growth in the North America segment.
    *   Gross and operating margins in the North America segment.
    *   Market share data for the athletic apparel industry.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Continued market share losses to competitors.
    *   A recession that further dampens consumer spending.
    *   Failed product launches.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. This is a "show-me" story. Investors should wait for signs of a turnaround before getting more constructive.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. 2025 Restructuring Plan**

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Annual Revenue: ~$5.7 billion (based on fiscal 2024)
    *   Current Operating Margin (pre-restructuring): ~5% (hypothetical, for illustration)
    *   Current P/E Ratio: 20x (hypothetical, for illustration)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   **Base Case (100 bps margin improvement):** $5.7B revenue \* (5% + 1%) margin = $342M operating income (+ $57M). Assuming a 25% tax rate and 435M shares outstanding, this adds ~$0.10 to EPS. At a 20x P/E, this could add $2.00 to the share price.
    *   **High Case (150 bps margin improvement):** $5.7B revenue \* (5% + 1.5%) margin = $370.5M operating income (+ $85.5M). Assuming a 25% tax rate and 435M shares outstanding, this adds ~$0.15 to EPS. At a 20x P/E, this could add $3.00 to the share price.
*   **Citation for Revenue:** Fiscal 2024 revenue was $5.7 billion.

**2. Share Repurchase Program**

*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Current Shares Outstanding: 435 million (approximate)
    *   Annual Net Income: ~$300 million (hypothetical, for illustration)
    *   Current EPS: ~$0.69
*   **Calculation:**
    *   **Base Case ($200M repurchase at $7/share):** $200M / $7 = ~28.6M shares repurchased. New shares outstanding: 435M - 28.6M = 406.4M. New EPS: $300M / 406.4M = ~$0.74 (a 7% increase).

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Under Armour are moderately positive. The ongoing restructuring plan and share repurchase program provide a clear path to improved profitability and shareholder returns. The recent insider buying is a strong vote of confidence from the company's leadership. However, these positive factors are set against a backdrop of declining revenues, particularly in the key North American market. The short-term market signal is therefore mixed, with the positive catalysts providing some downside protection and a potential for modest upside if the company can show progress on its restructuring goals in the coming quarters.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failure to Stabilize North American Revenue:** If the decline in the company's largest market accelerates, it could more than offset any cost savings from the restructuring plan, leading to further earnings declines and a lower stock price.
2.  **Execution Failure of Restructuring Plan:** If the restructuring plan fails to deliver the expected cost savings or leads to significant operational disruptions, it could result in the company incurring the costs of the plan without realizing the benefits.
3.  **Macroeconomic Downturn:** A significant economic recession would likely lead to a further slowdown in consumer discretionary spending, which would negatively impact the entire athletic apparel industry, including Under Armour.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on the analysis, the near-term outlook for Under Armour is moderately positive, with a conservative upside potential of 10-20%. The key catalyst is the successful execution of the 2025 Restructuring Plan, which has the potential to significantly improve profitability even in a flat revenue environment. The single most important indicator to monitor is the company's operating margin in its upcoming quarterly reports, which will be the first concrete evidence of the restructuring plan's success.
