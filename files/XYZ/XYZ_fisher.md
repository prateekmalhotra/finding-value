Company, Block, Inc. (SQ), date of analysis, August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block operates in two large and growing ecosystems: Square for sellers and Cash App for consumers. For Square, the company is focused on expanding its services for restaurants, retail, and appointment-based businesses, and growing its international presence. For Cash App, which had 57 million monthly transacting actives as of December 2024, the strategy is to become a primary banking service provider for households in the United States earning up to $150,000 per year. This focus on a large demographic with a suite of financial products including payments, banking services, and investing indicates a significant runway for growth. The company continues to expand internationally, with operations in countries including Canada, Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, and Spain.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block has a consistent history of expanding its product offerings within its Square and Cash App ecosystems. For Square, the company has evolved from a simple payment processor to an integrated system including point-of-sale software, online stores, and banking services. Cash App has similarly grown from a peer-to-peer payment service to a broad financial platform offering banking, investing, and bitcoin transactions. The company's product development expenses were $2.9 billion in 2024, a 7% increase from 2023, indicating a continued commitment to innovation. Strategic priorities include leveraging AI to enhance productivity and building out banking services for both sellers and consumers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's product development expenses were $760.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, representing 13% of total net revenue for the period. In fiscal year 2024, product development expenses were $2.9 billion, or 12% of total net revenue. While a direct comparison of R&D effectiveness is difficult without proprietary data, the continuous rollout of new products and features for both the Square and Cash App ecosystems, such as the Square Credit Card and expanded banking features in Cash App, demonstrates a tangible output from its R&D investments. The company's focus is on innovating within its ecosystems to increase user engagement and monetization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block employs a multi-channel sales and marketing strategy. For the Square ecosystem, the company utilizes direct marketing, online advertising, and affiliate programs, supplemented by a direct sales and account management team for larger sellers. For Cash App, peer-to-peer transactions serve as the primary and highly efficient customer acquisition channel, driven by network effects. Sales and marketing expenses were $504.5 million in the first quarter of 2025, an increase of 14% year-over-year, reflecting investments to support the growth of both Cash App and Square. The company's ability to attract millions of sellers and Cash App users suggests an effective, if not traditionally structured, sales and marketing apparatus.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the three months ended March 31, 2025, Block's gross profit was $2.3 billion, representing a gross margin of approximately 39.7% on total net revenue of $5.8 billion. For the full year 2024, gross profit was $8.9 billion on $24.1 billion of revenue, for a gross margin of 36.9%. While bitcoin revenue is a significant portion of total revenue, it generates very low gross profit margins (approximately 3% in Q1 2025). Excluding bitcoin, the company's gross margins are substantially higher. Operating income was $329.3 million in the first quarter of 2025, a significant improvement from the prior year.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's management has been focused on cost efficiency and disciplined growth. In 2023, the company announced a cap of 12,000 on its number of employees, which it achieved in 2024 and plans to maintain. This measure is aimed at controlling personnel-related expenses, a major component of operating costs. The company is also focused on leveraging its platform to cross-sell higher-margin software and financial services to its existing seller and consumer bases. For instance, banking services within both ecosystems are a key strategic priority, which typically carry higher margins than transaction processing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Block had 11,372 full-time employees worldwide. In 2020, the company adopted a distributed work model, offering employees flexibility in their work location. While this model can be attractive to talent, public information on employee satisfaction and labor relations is limited in SEC filings. The company has undertaken restructuring, including capping its employee base, which can affect morale. Without more direct evidence from employee surveys or other verifiable sources, it is difficult to definitively assess the state of labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block is led by co-founder Jack Dorsey, who serves as "Block Head and Chairperson." The leadership team includes executives with significant tenures at the company and in the technology and finance industries. The dual-class stock structure concentrates voting power with early stockholders, including management, which suggests a stable, though potentially entrenched, leadership. Information on the internal dynamics of the executive team is not publicly available in detail.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's leadership team consists of experienced executives overseeing its key business segments and functions. The company has leaders for its Square and Cash App ecosystems, as well as for functions like finance, legal, and technology. The decentralized structure with clear leaders for each ecosystem suggests a degree of management depth. However, the prominence of co-founder Jack Dorsey could indicate a key-person risk.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, which has issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting for its Square and Cash App businesses, allowing for analysis of revenue and gross profit drivers. However, the company has received inquiries from the SEC and Department of Justice following a short-seller report in March 2023, related to compliance and risk practices, indicating potential areas of concern. In January 2025, the company entered into a consent order with the CFPB related to customer service and dispute resolution.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block's key competitive advantage lies in its two-sided network effects. The Square ecosystem integrates a wide array of services for sellers, creating high switching costs. The Cash App ecosystem benefits from strong network effects in its peer-to-peer payments, which drives low-cost customer acquisition. The company's strategy to connect these two ecosystems, for instance through Cash App Pay for Square sellers, could create a powerful and defensible market position. This deep integration of services is a key differentiator in the fragmented fintech landscape.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block has historically prioritized growth and investment in its ecosystems over short-term profitability, as evidenced by its significant and sustained investments in product development and marketing. The company's strategic initiatives, such as building out banking services and leveraging AI, are long-term in nature. While the recent focus on cost discipline and the employee cap indicates a greater emphasis on profitability, the core strategy remains centered on long-term ecosystem development. Management's commentary consistently emphasizes long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Block had $9.2 billion in available liquidity, including $8.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and investments, plus an undrawn $775 million revolving credit facility. The company has a share repurchase program, with $2.2 billion remaining as of March 31, 2025, indicating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than dilutive financing. While the company has used equity in the past for large acquisitions, its current financial position appears strong enough to fund organic growth without significant dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block provides detailed quarterly shareholder letters and holds earnings calls with extensive Q&A sessions. The company's filings disclose ongoing legal and regulatory challenges, such as the inquiries from the SEC and DOJ. Management has also publicly addressed the short-seller report from March 2023. This level of disclosure suggests a commitment to transparency with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Block is facing regulatory scrutiny. The company received inquiries from the SEC and DOJ following a March 2023 short-seller report concerning compliance and risk practices. In January 2025, Block entered into a consent order with the CFPB regarding customer service and dispute resolution and another with state regulators regarding its AML program. In April 2025, it entered into a consent order with the New York State Department of Financial Services related to its Bank Secrecy Act/anti-money laundering and bitcoin programs, which included a $40 million penalty. These regulatory actions raise questions about the company's compliance culture and, by extension, management's oversight.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025021538/sq-20250331.htm'] (May 2, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1512673/000162828025007376/sq-20241231.htm'] (February 24, 2025)

---
Synthesis:
Block, Inc. demonstrates significant strengths in its large and expandable market opportunities, a strong commitment to innovation, and a defensible competitive position due to its ecosystem and network effects. The company is taking clear steps to improve profitability and has a solid financial position to fund future growth. However, the analysis also reveals notable weaknesses. Several negative points stem from a lack of verifiable positive evidence, particularly regarding internal relations (labor and executive). More critically, recent regulatory consent orders and ongoing inquiries into the company's compliance and accounting controls raise significant questions about its integrity and risk management.

The Fisher Score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the resolution of the outstanding regulatory inquiries and the successful execution of its margin improvement plan. A clean bill of health from the SEC and DOJ, along with demonstrated, sustained improvement in operating margins, would likely flip the "No" answers on points 10 and 15 to "Yes." Conversely, further regulatory sanctions or a failure to control costs could solidify these weaknesses and potentially turn other borderline "Yes" answers to "No." Specific evidence that would improve the score includes the closure of government investigations without material adverse findings and a consistent trend of operating margin expansion over several quarters.

fisher score is 10 / 15
