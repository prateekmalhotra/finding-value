On March 19, 2025, the Board authorized an increase of $53.4 million for common share repurchases, resulting in a total authorization of $100.0 million.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase Program:**

*   **Formula:** EPS = Net Income / Shares Outstanding
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Net Income: $100 million
    *   Shares Outstanding (pre-repurchase): 28 million
    *   Repurchase Amount: $75 million
    *   Repurchase Price: $35 per share
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Shares Repurchased = $75 million / $35 = 2.14 million
    *   Shares Outstanding (post-repurchase) = 28 million - 2.14 million = 25.86 million
    *   EPS (pre-repurchase) = $100 million / 28 million = $3.57
    *   EPS (post-repurchase) = $100 million / 25.86 million = $3.87
    *   EPS Increase = ($3.87 - $3.57) / $3.57 = 8.4%

**2. Acquisition of 9 Story Media Group:**

*   **Formula:** EV/EBITDA
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Scholastic EV (pre-acquisition): $1.2 billion
    *   Scholastic EBITDA (pre-acquisition): $150 million
    *   9 Story EBITDA (post-synergies): $20 million
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Combined EBITDA = $150 million + $20 million = $170 million
    *   EV/EBITDA (pre-acquisition) = $1.2 billion / $150 million = 8.0x
    *   Implied EV (post-acquisition) = 8.0x * $170 million = $1.36 billion
    *   EV Increase = ($1.36 billion - $1.2 billion) / $1.2 billion = 13.3%

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**
