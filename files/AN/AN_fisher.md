### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The US automotive retail market is large and fragmented, presenting an ongoing opportunity for consolidation. AutoNation is expanding its footprint of AutoNation USA used vehicle stores, with 40 stores open as of Q2 2025, and has a long-term goal of over 130. The company is also growing its collision and service centers, branded as "AutoNation Collision and Service," which cater to a recurring revenue stream. These expansion plans, combined with the company's position as the largest publicly traded automotive retailer, suggest a long runway for growth.

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a retailer, AutoNation does not have traditional R&D in the way a manufacturing or technology company would.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While specific metrics on employee turnover and engagement are not readily available, the company's latest 10-K does not mention any significant labor disputes. AutoNation emphasizes its "One AutoNation" culture, which is focused on teamwork and customer service. The company offers a variety of training and development programs for its employees. However, without more quantitative data, it is difficult to definitively assess the state of its labor relations.
**Answer:** No

**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's executive team has a mix of industry veterans and experienced leaders from other sectors.

**Citations:** []

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In automotive retail, scale is a significant competitive advantage, and AutoNation is the largest publicly traded player. This allows for purchasing power with manufacturers and suppliers, a wider selection of vehicles for customers, and the ability to invest in technology and marketing at a scale that smaller competitors cannot match. The company's "AutoNation USA" brand for used-car stores is a key differentiator, and its growing network of collision and service centers provides a recurring and high-margin revenue stream.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's investments in its AutoNation USA stores, its digital platform, and its own financing arm (CIG Financial) indicate a focus on long-term growth. These initiatives require significant upfront investment and may not generate immediate returns, but they are crucial for building a more integrated and profitable business in the long run. The company's consistent share repurchase program also suggests a commitment to long-term shareholder value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations. The company has a substantial share repurchase program, which is the opposite of diluting shareholders. In its Q2 2025 earnings release, the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $1 billion of its common stock. This indicates that the company has ample financial resources to fund its growth initiatives without needing to issue new shares.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/350698/000035069825000100/an-20250630.htm']

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AutoNation's management team regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor conferences, and SEC filings. The transcripts of these calls show a willingness to discuss both positive and negative trends in the business and to answer questions from analysts. For example, in the Q2 2025 earnings call, management addressed the impact of rising interest rates on affordability and the competitive landscape in the used-vehicle market.
**Answer:** Yes

**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis: AutoNation scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market position, growth strategy, and financial strength. The company's scale as the largest publicly traded auto retailer gives it significant competitive advantages. Its investments in used vehicles, digital capabilities, and customer financing are likely to be key drivers of future growth. The two areas where the company could improve its score are in executive relations and labor relations. The score could change in the next 12-24 months depending on the stability and long-term vision of the executive team, as well as more transparent reporting on employee satisfaction and retention. To change the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to demonstrate a period of stability in its senior leadership and provide more concrete evidence of positive employee relations.

fisher score is 13 / 15
