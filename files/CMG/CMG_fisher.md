The success of the Chipotlane, which is included in over 80% of new restaurants, demonstrates the effectiveness of their process innovation.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle's management regularly communicates with investors through quarterly earnings calls and SEC filings. The transcripts of these calls are publicly available and provide insights into the company's performance and strategy. In its Q2 2025 10-Q, the company acknowledged a decrease in comparable restaurant sales and transactions, attributing it to a slowdown in consumer spending, but also noted positive momentum at the end of the quarter. This willingness to discuss both positive and negative trends suggests a degree of candor with investors.

Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
Chipotle Mexican Grill demonstrates strong fundamentals across many of Fisher's 15 points, particularly in its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and financial strength. The company's clear expansion plans, both domestically and internationally, coupled with its robust digital strategy and investments in operational efficiency, position it for continued success. However, the analysis also reveals areas of concern, notably in labor relations and management integrity, with ongoing unionization efforts and shareholder lawsuits casting a shadow. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months will be the resolution of the pending litigation and the company's ability to navigate labor challenges while maintaining its strong culture of internal promotion. A favorable outcome in the lawsuits and a demonstrated improvement in employee relations would be key to flipping the "No" answers to "Yes."

fisher score is 13 / 15
