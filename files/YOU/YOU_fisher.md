**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clear Secure has demonstrated a commitment to ongoing development through the expansion of its platform and services. The launch of TSA PreCheck® Enrollment in February 2024 and the rollout of CLEAR Mobile in five airport locations showcase efforts to broaden its travel-related offerings. Furthermore, the company is actively investing in its CLEAR1 platform, which provides identity verification solutions for B2B partners in sectors like healthcare and financial services, indicating a strategy to diversify revenue streams beyond aviation.

This represents approximately 9.5% of 2024 revenue. The company highlights its innovative and scalable platform, with a technology team of approximately 220 people.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clear Secure's primary sales channel for its CLEAR Plus membership is in-airport, accounting for 64% of member acquisitions in 2024. The company also has strategic partnerships with major airlines like Delta, United, and Alaska, as well as American Express, to promote its services. The company states a Lifetime Value to Customer Acquisition Cost ratio of approximately 10 times for members who joined in 2024, which suggests an efficient member acquisition strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clear Secure is focused on scaling its higher-margin CLEAR1 B2B platform and leveraging its existing airport infrastructure to offer new services like TSA PreCheck® Enrollment, which can improve margins by adding revenue with minimal incremental cost. Management has also discussed pricing optimization for its CLEAR Plus membership. The introduction of the more efficient "Lane of the Future" technology may also contribute to long-term margin improvement through operational efficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Clear Secure had 4,022 full-time employees. The company states that none of its employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and believes its employee relations to be strong. The company's core values include "Our Great People," and it emphasizes a unique workplace culture focused on being a meritocracy. There is no evidence of significant labor disputes in the provided documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company was co-founded by Caryn Seidman Becker (Chairman and CEO) and Kenneth Cornick (President and CFO), who continue to lead the company, suggesting stability at the highest level. However, without access to the 2025 Proxy Statement, a full assessment of board stability, succession planning, and incentive alignment is not possible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K lists key executives beyond the CEO, including a President and CFO. However, further detail on the depth of the management team and succession planning is not readily available in the provided documents. Without the proxy statement, it's difficult to fully assess the depth of the management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clear Secure's annual report includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements. The company has also filed a report on its management's assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. This suggests that the company has adequate accounting controls in place. The financial statements provide a reasonable level of detail on costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Clear Secure benefits from network effects; as more airports and partners join the network, the service becomes more valuable to members, which in turn attracts more partners. The company's established relationships with airport authorities and airlines create a barrier to entry for new competitors. Furthermore, its platform is built on a foundation of high-security standards required for the aviation industry, which is a competitive advantage when expanding into other verticals that require trusted identity verification.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is investing in new products and verticals, such as the CLEAR1 platform and TSA PreCheck® Enrollment, which may not contribute significantly to near-term profits but are crucial for long-term growth and diversification. Management's commentary in earnings calls often emphasizes expanding the platform and member base, which aligns with a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/YOU/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/YOU/transcripts/) (2023-2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Clear Secure had $87.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $442.3 million in marketable securities. The company generated $283.7 million in free cash flow in 2024. This strong cash position and cash flow generation suggest that the company is well-capitalized to fund its growth initiatives without needing to raise additional equity. The company also has a $100 million revolving credit facility. The company has an active share repurchase program, further indicating it is not likely to issue new equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000054/you-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000054/you-20250331.htm) (March 31, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of earnings call transcripts from 2023 to 2025 indicates that management openly discusses challenges and risks, such as the impact of TSA's increased random re-verification rates on the customer experience and member retention. The company's SEC filings also provide a detailed "Risk Factors" section. This suggests a commitment to transparent communication with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/YOU/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/YOU/transcripts/) (2023-2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no legal proceedings mentioned in the provided SEC filings that would suggest a lack of integrity. The 2024 10-K states, "Currently, there are no claims or proceedings against us that we believe will have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows." A review of related-party transactions will be necessary from the proxy statement to make a full determination.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1856314/000185631425000008/you-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

**Synthesis**

Clear Secure, Inc. scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly regarding its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and strong financial position. The company's core CLEAR Plus service has a significant runway for growth, and its expansion into new verticals with the CLEAR1 platform demonstrates a forward-thinking approach. The company's strong brand, network effects, and efficient customer acquisition model are key competitive advantages. However, the analysis is limited by the lack of the most recent proxy statement, which prevents a full assessment of executive relations, management depth, and integrity.

The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful scaling of the CLEAR1 platform and the TSA PreCheck® Enrollment service. Evidence of significant revenue growth and margin contribution from these new initiatives would strengthen the case for the company's long-term growth prospects. Additionally, a detailed review of the next proxy statement would be necessary to change the "No" answers to "Yes" for points 8, 9, and 15, specifically by providing insight into board stability, succession planning, and related-party transactions.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
