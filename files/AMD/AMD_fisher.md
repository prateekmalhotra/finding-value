### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD is strongly positioned in high-growth markets, particularly data centers and artificial intelligence. The company forecasts the total addressable market (TAM) for data center AI chips to reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD's Data Center segment revenue increased 98% in the six months ended June 29, 2024, driven by the ramp of AMD Instinct™ GPU shipments and strong sales of 4th Gen AMD EPYC™ CPUs. This growth trajectory is supported by a robust product roadmap and increasing demand for AI and high-performance computing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD's R&D spending is effective, as evidenced by its significant market share gains in key segments. For the three months ended June 29, 2024, R&D expenses were $1.6 billion, or approximately 27% of net revenue. While competitor Nvidia spends more on R&D in absolute terms, AMD's R&D spending as a percentage of revenue is higher (26% for AMD vs. 14% for Nvidia in fiscal year 2023). This investment has translated into market success, with AMD's server CPU revenue share reaching a record 33.9% in the third quarter of 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD's profit margins are substantial and improving, though they still trail its primary competitor in the GPU space. For the three months ended June 29, 2024, AMD's gross margin was 49%, an increase from 46% in the prior year period. The company's adjusted gross margins have been on an upward trend, reaching 53% in Q3 2024, a significant improvement from the ~40% range in 2019. While still below Nvidia's margins, this demonstrates a strong and improving profitability profile.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD is actively working to improve its profit margins by shifting its product mix towards higher-value data center solutions. The increase in gross margin in the first half of 2024 was "primarily driven by higher Data Center segment revenue." This strategy of focusing on the high-margin data center market, where its EPYC CPUs and Instinct GPUs command higher average selling prices, is a core component of its margin expansion efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248824000123/amd-20240629.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248824000123/amd-20240629.htm) (July 31, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD appears to have strong employee relations, as indicated by its human capital disclosures and external awards.

The company's website and 2024 10-K list a number of senior executives with significant industry experience, heading key divisions such as the Data Center Solutions Group, Computing and Graphics Group, and Global Operations. The executive team's average tenure of 3.2 years indicates a good blend of experience and fresh perspectives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**,

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD maintains effective cost analysis and accounting controls. The company's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, which gives an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company provides detailed segment reporting in its financial statements, offering transparency into revenues and operating income for its key business units.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD's fabless manufacturing model, which relies on partnerships with leading-edge foundries like TSMC, allows it to focus on chip design while leveraging the manufacturing expertise of its partners. This is a key competitive advantage in the capital-intensive semiconductor industry. The company's semi-custom business, providing SoCs for major gaming consoles like the Sony PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox, creates a unique and stable revenue stream. AMD is also fostering an open software ecosystem (ROCm) to compete with Nvidia's CUDA platform in the AI space.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248825000012/amd-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248825000012/amd-20241228.htm) (February 5, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD's strategy clearly prioritizes long-term growth over short-term profit maximization. The company's significant and increasing investment in R&D, which stands at over 20% of revenue, underscores this focus. Strategic acquisitions like Silo AI and ZT Systems are aimed at building out its AI and data center capabilities for the long term. Management's public statements consistently emphasize the long-term market opportunity in AI and the company's commitment to investing to capture that opportunity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD has a strong financial position that minimizes the risk of equity dilution. The company has a significant stock repurchase program, with $5.2 billion remaining available as of June 29, 2024. For the six months ended June 29, 2024, the company generated over $1.1 billion in cash from operations. With a strong cash position and access to debt markets, AMD is well-equipped to fund its growth initiatives without needing to issue significant amounts of new equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248824000123/amd-20240629.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248824000123/amd-20240629.htm) (July 31, 2024)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** AMD's management team generally communicates with investors in a candid and transparent manner. In their quarterly earnings calls, they address both positive and negative developments. For example, in the Q2 2024 earnings call, management discussed the strong performance of the Data Center and Client segments while also acknowledging the ongoing inventory normalization in the Embedded segment and lower semi-custom revenue in the Gaming segment. This balanced approach to communication fosters investor trust.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248824000123/amd-20240629.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/2488/000000248824000123/amd-20240629.htm) (July 31, 2024)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence to suggest that AMD's management lacks integrity. The company has a comprehensive Worldwide Standards of Business Conduct and a well-defined Ethics and Compliance Program overseen by the Board of Directors. A review of public records and news reports does not reveal any significant legal or ethical scandals involving the executive team. While the company faces routine legal proceedings as disclosed in its 10-K, there are no red flags that would question the integrity of its leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
