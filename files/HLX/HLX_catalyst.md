*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The contracts contribute to the lower end of the company's revenue guidance of $1.2 billion for 2025.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The contracts help the company achieve the mid-point of its revenue guidance of $1.25 billion for 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** The contracts lead to revenue exceeding the high end of the guidance at $1.3 billion for 2025.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10–30%). The impact is based on the potential for a re-rating of the stock due to improved revenue visibility and reduced risk.

*   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS) and can lead to a higher stock price. It also provides a floor for the stock price by creating additional demand.
*   **Timing:** Ongoing, with the pace of repurchases depending on market conditions and the company's free cash flow generation.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases a minimal amount of shares, having a negligible impact on EPS.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company continues to repurchase shares at a pace similar to recent quarters, leading to a modest increase in EPS.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company accelerates its share repurchases, leading to a significant increase in EPS.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (0–10%). The impact is likely to be modest, as the market may have already priced in the existence of the buyback program.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a history of repurchasing shares, but the pace can be variable.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued generation of free cash flow and a belief by management that the stock is undervalued.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on the number of shares repurchased.
    *   The company's free cash flow generation.
    *   Management commentary on capital allocation priorities.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the business that reduces free cash flow.
    *   A change in capital allocation strategy, with a focus on acquisitions or debt reduction instead of buybacks.
    *   A sharp increase in the stock price, which could make buybacks less attractive.
