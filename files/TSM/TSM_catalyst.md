*   **Formula:** Gordon Growth Model: P = D1 / (k - g)
*   **Inputs:**
    *   D1 (Next Year's Dividend): $2.25 (assuming 10% growth from the current $2.13)
    *   k (Cost of Equity): 8% (hypothetical)
    *   g (Growth Rate): 5% (current) vs. 5.5% (with successful N2 ramp)
*   **Calculation (Current):** P = $2.25 / (0.08 - 0.05) = $75
*   **Calculation (with N2 success):** P = $2.25 / (0.08 - 0.055) = $90
*   **Impact:** A 20% increase in the theoretical stock price.

**2. Aggressive Capital Expenditure and Capacity Expansion:**

*   **Assumption:** The $40 billion in 2025 capex generates a 20% return on invested capital (ROIC).
*   **Formula:** Incremental Net Income = Capex * ROIC
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Capex: $40 billion
    *   ROIC: 20%
*   **Calculation:** Incremental Net Income = $40B * 0.20 = $8 billion
*   **Impact:** A significant increase in future earnings, which would lead to a higher stock price. Assuming a P/E ratio of 20x, this would add $160 billion to the company's market capitalization.
