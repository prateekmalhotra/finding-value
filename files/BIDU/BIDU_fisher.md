**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu is heavily investing in AI and autonomous driving. The company continues to develop its ERNIE foundational models and its deep learning framework, PaddlePaddle.

**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Q2 2025, Baidu's R&D expenses accounted for 18% of Baidu Core's revenue. The company's focus on AI has led to tangible results, such as the growth of its AI Cloud business and the expansion of its autonomous driving services. Baidu's deep learning framework, PaddlePaddle, has a large and growing developer community, indicating its effectiveness.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu's online marketing revenue, a key indicator of its sales effectiveness, decreased by 6% year-over-year in Q1 2025 and 15% in Q2 2025, indicating challenges in its core advertising business. However, the 40% growth in non-online marketing revenue in Q1 2025, driven by AI Cloud, suggests a burgeoning sales capability in new enterprise markets. Given the decline in the core business, there is not enough evidence to support an above-average sales organization across the entire company.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In Q2 2025, Baidu Core reported a net margin of 28% and a non-GAAP net margin of 18%. In Q1 2025, Baidu Core's net margin was 30% and its non-GAAP net margin was 25%. These are strong margins, indicating good profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710109-baidu-inc-bidu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710109-baidu-inc-bidu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (August 20, 2025), [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-announces-first-quarter-2025-results-302452291.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-announces-first-quarter-2025-results-302452291.html) (May 21, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu is focused on improving efficiency. Research and development expenses decreased by 15% year-over-year in Q1 2025, primarily due to a decrease in personnel-related expenses. The company is also focusing on growing its higher-margin AI cloud business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-announces-first-quarter-2025-results-302452291.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-announces-first-quarter-2025-results-302452291.html) (May 21, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information available in the provided sources regarding Baidu's labor and personnel relations, such as employee turnover or satisfaction metrics. A decrease in R&D personnel-related expenses could hint at layoffs or other staffing changes, but there isn't enough information to make a determination.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Co-founder and CEO Robin Li remains at the helm of the company. The executive team appears stable, with key leaders heading the various business groups. There are no public reports of significant executive infighting or departures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710109-baidu-inc-bidu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710109-baidu-inc-bidu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (August 20, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu's earnings calls feature not only the CEO and CFO, but also the Executive Vice Presidents in charge of the Baidu Mobile Ecosystem Group (MEG) and the Baidu AI Cloud Group (ACG). This demonstrates a depth of leadership and expertise across the company's key business segments.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu provides detailed financial breakdowns, including segment reporting for Baidu Core and iQIYI. The company's filings with the SEC and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange are timely and appear to be in good order. There are no reports of significant accounting issues or restatements. The company's annual report on Form 20-F for 2024 was filed on schedule on March 28, 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu's leadership in AI and autonomous driving in China is a key competitive advantage. Its ERNIE foundation model is a core asset that powers its various services. The company's massive user base and data from its search engine provide a significant moat. The integration of AI into its search engine and other products is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Baidu's continued investment in AI and autonomous driving, despite the negative impact on near-term free cash flow, demonstrates a long-range outlook. In Q1 2025, free cash flow was negative, mainly due to increased investment in the AI business.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, Baidu had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and short-term investments of RMB 142.0 billion ($19.57 billion). In March 2025, the company completed a CNY 10 billion debt offering and a $2 billion exchangeable bond offering. The company also has a share buyback program in place, having returned $445 million to shareholders in Q1 2025. This strong balance sheet and access to debt markets should be sufficient to fund growth without significant equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/baidu-files-annual-report-on-form-20f-for-fiscal-2024-3372990](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/baidu-files-annual-report-on-form-20f-for-fiscal-2024-3372990) (March 28, 2025), [https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-announces-first-quarter-2025-results-302452291.html](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/baidu-announces-first-quarter-2025-results-302452291.html) (May 21, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company holds regular earnings calls and provides detailed financial results. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management acknowledged the decrease in online marketing revenue and provided explanations for the trend. This suggests a willingness to be transparent with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710109-baidu-inc-bidu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4710109-baidu-inc-bidu-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (August 20, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent reports of major scandals or controversies involving Baidu's senior management. The company has a weighted voting rights structure, which gives co-founder Robin Li significant control, a potential governance risk. However, there is no evidence to suggest a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** None

---
Synthesis:
Baidu scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly in its commitment to long-term growth through AI and autonomous driving, its strong profitability, and its deep management team. The company's long-range outlook is evident in its willingness to sacrifice short-term free cash flow for investment in these high-potential areas. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the performance of the core online marketing business and the company's ability to successfully monetize its AI initiatives. A return to growth in online marketing would flip the "No" on the sales organization to a "Yes," while a failure to show a clear path to profitability for AI Cloud and autonomous driving could threaten the long-range outlook.

fisher score is 13 / 15
