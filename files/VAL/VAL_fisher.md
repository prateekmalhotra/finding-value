### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Valaris is a leading provider of offshore contract drilling services with a large and modern fleet. The company is well-positioned to benefit from the current upcycle in offshore drilling, driven by increased demand for oil and gas. Valaris has a significant contract backlog of $4.7 billion, the highest it has been in a decade, with new contracts being signed at higher day rates. The long-term fundamentals for offshore activity remain strong, with customers prioritizing long-cycle offshore developments.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Valaris is focused on maintaining a high-specification fleet, with 12 of its 13 drillships being seventh-generation units. This represents the highest concentration of such advanced equipment in the industry. The company's strategy is to secure attractive long-term contracts for this modern fleet, indicating a focus on leveraging its existing assets rather than developing entirely new product or service lines. While there is a commitment to fleet modernization, the information available does not detail specific development of new products or processes beyond this.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an offshore drilling contractor, Valaris's "R&D" is more focused on operational efficiency and fleet modernization rather than traditional product R&D. The company has a strong track record of operational excellence, with a fleetwide revenue efficiency of 96% in the second quarter of 2025. This focus on efficiency and safety is crucial in the offshore drilling industry. However, there is no specific information available regarding R&D spending as a percentage of revenue or other quantitative metrics to definitively assess R&D effectiveness.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?

The company has successfully secured multiple multi-year drillship contracts at average day rates above $400,000. This success in a competitive market indicates a highly effective sales and marketing organization that can capitalize on market trends and build strong customer relationships.

The company also generated adjusted free cash flow of $63 million. While the offshore drilling industry is cyclical, these are strong margins and indicate a return to profitability in the current upcycle.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Valaris is actively working to improve its profit margins by focusing on securing long-term contracts at higher day rates for its high-specification fleet.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management emphasizes a strong safety culture and reported no Lost Time Incidents in the first half of 2025, which is a positive indicator of labor relations. Several rigs have achieved significant safety milestones. While this is a good sign, there is no comprehensive information available regarding employee turnover, union relations, or overall employee satisfaction to definitively assess personnel relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, including the CEO, CFO, and CCO, appears stable and presents a unified front in earnings calls.

**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 9) Depth of Management

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The earnings call transcript for Q2 2025 included the President and CEO, Anton Dibowitz; Senior Vice President and CFO, Chris Weber; and Senior Vice President and CCO, Matt Lyne.

**Citations:**

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Valaris provides clear financial reporting in its SEC filings, with segment-level data and detailed financial statements. The company's ability to provide specific financial guidance and report metrics like revenue efficiency suggests a good handle on cost analysis and accounting controls. However, without access to the full text of the 10-K and any related auditor reports, a definitive "Yes" is not possible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the offshore drilling industry, the quality and technical specification of the rig fleet are paramount. Valaris has the highest concentration of modern, seventh-generation drillships in the industry. This provides a significant competitive advantage, allowing the company to command higher day rates and secure longer-term contracts for the most technically demanding projects. This focus on a high-specification fleet is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

This indicates a long-range view of profitability and a desire to create a stable revenue stream. The company is strategically positioning its fleet for a multi-year upcycle in the offshore drilling market, suggesting a focus on long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of the end of Q2 2025, Valaris had a strong liquidity position with $516 million in cash and cash equivalents and nearly $900 million in total liquidity. The company is generating positive free cash flow ($63 million in Q2 2025). This strong financial position suggests that Valaris is well-equipped to fund its operations and growth initiatives without needing to resort to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed both opportunities and risks. For example, they highlighted the strong demand for high-specification drillships while also noting the challenging market for semisubmersibles in Australia and a potential trough in drillship utilization in the first half of 2026. This balanced discussion of both positives and negatives demonstrates a willingness to be candid with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the provided search results to suggest any issues with management's integrity, such as legal or regulatory problems, related-party transactions, or governance red flags.

**Synthesis:**
Valaris scores well on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its market position, sales organization, and financial strength. The company is well-positioned to capitalize on the current upcycle in the offshore drilling industry, thanks to its modern fleet of high-specification drillships. The strong contract backlog and rising day rates point to a positive outlook for revenue and profitability. The primary areas of weakness in this analysis are related to a lack of detailed information on internal operations, such as R&D effectiveness, labor relations, and management depth. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with more detailed disclosures on these fronts, as well as a continued focus on operational excellence and a successful navigation of the cyclical nature of the offshore drilling market. A key variable to watch will be the company's ability to maintain its high day rates and utilization levels as new contracts are negotiated and the market evolves.

**fisher score is 8 / 15**
