**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the SaaS industry, a key indicator of competitive strength is the ability to attract and retain large customers and to expand the use of the platform within those customers. monday.com's high and growing net dollar retention rate for enterprise customers (116% for customers with over $50,000 in ARR and 117% for customers with over $100,000 in ARR) is a strong positive indicator. The platform's flexibility and customizability, which allow it to be used across a wide variety of industries, also provide a competitive advantage.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's significant investment in R&D (20% of revenue) and its focus on expanding its customer base, particularly in the enterprise segment, indicate a long-range outlook. While the company is currently profitable on a non-GAAP basis, its emphasis on growth and innovation suggests a willingness to reinvest in the business for long-term success.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** monday.com has a strong balance sheet, with $1.59 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q2 2025. The company is also generating significant free cash flow, with a projection of $320 million to $326 million for the full year 2025. This strong financial position and cash generation ability should allow the company to fund its growth initiatives without the need for dilutive equity financing.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed quarterly earnings releases and hosts conference calls with analysts, which suggests a commitment to investor communication. However, without an instance of "trouble" to observe management's response, it is difficult to fully assess their candor in all situations.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis**

monday.com exhibits many of the characteristics of a "Fisher stock," with strong growth, a commitment to innovation, and a solid financial position. The company's platform business model, with its inherent scalability and network effects, appears to give it a sustainable competitive advantage. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of its new AI-powered product features and its ability to continue to attract and retain large enterprise customers. A "No" on labor relations, management depth, and candor could be flipped to a "Yes" with more detailed disclosures in company filings or investor presentations.

**fisher score is 9 / 15**
