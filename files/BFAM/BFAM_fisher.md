Here's an analysis of Bright Horizons Family Solutions Inc. (BFAM) using Philip A. Fisher’s “15 Points.”

**Company, August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed.**

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bright Horizons operates in the large and fragmented markets for child care, back-up care, and educational advisory services. The company's growth is supported by several factors, including the increasing participation of women in the workforce, the rising demand for high-quality, center-based child care, and the growing trend of employers offering family-friendly benefits to attract and retain talent. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, revenue increased by 7% year-over-year, driven by enrollment growth and tuition increases in the full-service center-based child care segment, and a 12% increase in back-up care revenue. The company has a strong client base, including over 220 Fortune 500 companies.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Bright Horizons has a history of expanding its service offerings to meet the evolving needs of its clients and their employees. The company has grown its back-up care services to include in-home care, tutoring, and pet care, and has expanded its educational advisory services to include tuition assistance and student loan repayment programs. In its Q1 2025 10-Q, the company states it continues to invest in "technology to better support our customer user experience and customer acquisition." The company's growth strategy includes expanding services to existing clients and selectively pursuing acquisitions to enhance its offerings.

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?

This model creates a sticky customer base and a predictable revenue stream.

The company has also been willing to make acquisitions that may not be immediately accretive to earnings but that position the company for future growth.

The company has a history of funding its growth through cash flow from operations and debt financing. The company has a share repurchase program in place, which further reduces the risk of dilution.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of any legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or other governance red flags that would call into question the integrity of the company's management.

Synthesis: Bright Horizons scores very well on Fisher's 15-point checklist, with strong positives in its market position, growth runway, management team, and financial strength. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are a downturn in the economy that could impact employer spending on benefits, a significant increase in competition, or a failure to continue to innovate and expand its service offerings. To maintain its high score, the company will need to continue to execute on its growth strategy, manage its costs effectively, and maintain its strong relationships with its clients and employees. A "No" on any of the points would require a significant negative development, such as a major scandal, a significant loss of market share, or a prolonged period of poor financial performance.

fisher score is 15 / 15
