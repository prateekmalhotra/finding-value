### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Launch of Bloomberg Index Products (B500)
*   **Type:** Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** MIAX has a 10-year exclusive license to list futures and options based on the Bloomberg US Large Cap Price Return Index (B500). The company plans to launch futures on the B500 Index in late Q4 2025 or early Q1 2026, with cash-settled index options and options on futures to follow in 2026.
*   **Mechanism:** This new, proprietary product suite will compete directly with established large-cap index products. A successful launch will generate new, high-margin revenue streams from transaction fees and proprietary market data, diversifying MIAX's revenue base and potentially attracting new market participants to its exchanges.
*   **Timing:**
    *   B500 Index Futures: Late Q4 2025 – Early Q1 2026
    *   B500 Index Options: First half of 2026
    *   B500 Options on Futures: Second half of 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Limited adoption, with the new products generating an additional 5% in revenue less cost of revenues in the first full year.
    *   **Base Scenario:** Moderate success, capturing a small but meaningful portion of the index derivatives market, leading to a 15% increase in revenue less cost of revenues.
    *   **High Scenario:** Strong adoption and significant market share capture, leading to a 30%+ increase in revenue less cost of revenues over the first two years.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%)
    *   A successful launch of a new, exclusive product suite in a large and lucrative market could significantly alter the company's growth trajectory and profitability, justifying a substantial re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%
    *   Rationale: The company has a definitive, 10-year exclusive agreement with a major index provider (Bloomberg) and has publicly stated a clear launch timeline. The primary uncertainty lies in the level of market adoption, not in the launch itself.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Timely regulatory approval from the CFTC and SEC for the new products.
    *   Successful migration of MIAX Futures to the new "Onyx" trading platform.
    *   Effective marketing and incentive programs to attract liquidity providers and order flow.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   CFTC and SEC rule filing submissions and approvals.
    *   Announcements of specific launch dates.
    *   Initial trading volumes and open interest in the new products.
    *   Management commentary on adoption rates in quarterly reports.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Regulatory delays in product approvals.
    *   Low market adoption due to the dominance of competing products (e.g., S&P 500 futures and options).
    *   Technical issues with the new Onyx trading platform.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy
    *   Rationale: This is a clearly defined, high-impact catalyst with a high probability of occurring in the near term. The potential upside from a successful launch appears to outweigh the risks.

**2. Catalyst Title:** MIAX Sapphire Trading Floor Launch
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** MIAX launched its fourth electronic options exchange, MIAX Sapphire, in August 2024. The company plans to open a physical trading floor for this exchange in Miami, Florida, in September 2025.
*   **Mechanism:** The launch of a physical trading floor will give MIAX access to the approximately 6% of the multi-listed options market that is still traded on exchange floors. This will allow MIAX to compete for all available options volume, increasing its total addressable market and potentially growing its overall market share and transaction fee revenue.
*   **Timing:** September 2025
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The trading floor attracts minimal new volume, increasing overall options market share by less than 0.5 percentage points.
    *   **Base Scenario:** MIAX captures a proportionate share of floor-traded volume, increasing its overall options market share by 1-2 percentage points.
    *   **High Scenario:** The new, modern trading floor and competitive pricing attract a significant portion of floor-traded volume, leading to a market share increase of over 2 percentage points.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (~10-30%)
    *   A successful entry into the floor trading market would demonstrate MIAX's ability to compete across all segments of the options market, leading to higher revenue and a potential multiple expansion.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%
    *   Rationale: The company has a stated, specific timeline for the launch and has already entered into a location agreement for the trading floor. This is a core strategic initiative with high visibility.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Successful build-out and launch of the physical trading floor infrastructure.
    *   Attracting floor brokers and market makers to the new venue.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Press releases confirming the launch of the trading floor.
    *   MIAX Sapphire's market share in the months following the launch.
    *   Number of members active on the new trading floor.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Delays in the construction and opening of the trading floor.
    *   Difficulty in attracting liquidity and order flow from established competitors' trading floors.
    *   Higher-than-expected operating costs for the physical trading floor.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch/Buy
    *   Rationale: A high-probability catalyst that expands the company's addressable market. Monitor market share data post-launch to confirm its success.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** International Expansion and Synergies (TISE Acquisition)
*   **Type:** M&A / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** MIAX completed the acquisition of The International Stock Exchange Group Limited (TISEG) in June 2025. TISE is a leading European professional bond market, providing MIAX with a significant presence in the UK and European markets.
*   **Mechanism:** This acquisition provides a platform for long-term growth through geographic diversification and expansion of product offerings. MIAX can leverage its technology to enhance TISE's platforms, and cross-sell services to a new international client base. This creates a new, non-U.S. revenue stream and positions MIAX as a global exchange operator.
*   **Timing:** 12-60 months
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** Minimal synergies, with TISE contributing its historical revenue growth rate (5-10% annually).
    *   **Base Scenario:** Successful integration of technology and cross-selling initiatives lead to accelerated revenue growth for TISE (15-20% annually) and the introduction of new MIAX products on the TISE platform.
    *   **High Scenario:** Significant synergies are realized, with MIAX technology driving substantial market share gains for TISE in Europe and MIAX successfully launching new derivatives products for the European market through TISE.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (~10-30%)
    *   Successful integration and growth in a new, major international market would validate MIAX's global expansion strategy and lead to a higher valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%
    *   Rationale: The acquisition is complete, but the realization of synergies and long-term growth is subject to execution risk. However, MIAX has a track record of successful M&A with BSX and MIAX Futures.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:**
    *   Smooth integration of TISE's operations and technology.
    *   Navigating the European regulatory environment.
    *   Successful development and launch of new products tailored to the European market.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Management commentary on the TISE integration process.
    *   Revenue and growth figures for the new International segment in quarterly reports.
    *   Announcements of new product listings on TISE.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Integration challenges and culture clashes.
    *   Unfavorable regulatory changes in the UK or EU.
    *   Failure to compete effectively with established European exchanges.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy
    *   Rationale: A strategic acquisition that opens up a large new market for MIAX. This provides a long-term growth vector that is not yet fully priced into the stock.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Launch of Bloomberg Index Products (B500)**
*   **Assumption:** The launch of the B500 product suite adds $50 million in high-margin revenue (Base Scenario) over the first two years.
*   **Formula:** Additional Enterprise Value = Additional Revenue * P/S Multiple
*   **Calculation:** $50,000,000 * 5x P/S = $250,000,000 in additional enterprise value.
*   **Citation for Data:** All data in this section is an inference based on the catalyst description in the S-1 filing.

**2. MIAX Sapphire Trading Floor Launch**
*   **Assumption:** The new trading floor captures 1.5 percentage points of the total options market share (Base Scenario).
*   **Formula:** Additional Revenue = (Total Market ADV * Market Share Gain * Trading Days * Revenue Per Contract)
*   **Calculation:** (44.36M contracts/day * 0.015 * 252 days * $0.091/contract) = $15.2 million in additional revenue.
*   **Citation for Data:** Market ADV, trading days, and RPC are from the S-1 filing for the year ended December 31, 2024.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for MIAX is overwhelmingly positive. The upcoming launch of the MIAX Sapphire trading floor in September 2025 and the highly anticipated launch of the exclusive Bloomberg B500 index products starting in late 2025 or early 2026 are significant, well-defined events that could materially increase revenue and market share. These catalysts are not speculative and are based on the company's stated plans and executed agreements. The recent IPO provides the capital to fund these growth initiatives. The primary risks are related to execution and market adoption rather than the occurrence of the events themselves.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Failure of the Bloomberg Products:** If the B500 product suite fails to gain any meaningful traction against established competitors, the significant investment and anticipated revenue growth will not materialize, likely leading to a sharp stock price decline.
2.  **Major Technological Failure:** A significant and prolonged outage of MIAX's trading or clearing systems could severely damage its reputation for technological excellence, which is a core part of its value proposition, and lead to a loss of market share.
3.  **Adverse Regulatory Changes:** New regulations that restrict payment for order flow, alter the market data fee structure, or otherwise negatively impact the current exchange business model could significantly reduce profitability and growth prospects.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

MIAX presents a compelling investment case based on a series of well-defined, near-term catalysts. The most significant of these is the launch of the exclusive Bloomberg B500 index products, which has the potential to create a substantial new revenue stream and drive a re-rating of the stock. A conservative estimate of the combined impact of the near-term catalysts suggests a potential upside in the range of 20-40%. The single most important indicator to monitor will be the initial trading volume and open interest in the B500 futures upon their launch in late 2025/early 2026.
