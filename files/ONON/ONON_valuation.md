#### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

*   **Revenue Growth:** Management raised its full-year guidance to "at least 31% at constant currency." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 18, 2025)
*   **Gross Margin:** The company increased its gross profit margin guidance to "between 60.5% and 61%." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 18, 2025)
*   **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** Guidance for adjusted EBITDA margin was raised to "17-17.5%." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 18, 2025)

#### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Forecast:** We will use the midpoint of management's guidance for Year 1 (31%) and then conservatively ramp down the growth rate by 3% per year, reflecting increasing market saturation and the law of large numbers.
*   **Margin Path:** We will maintain a stable operating margin of 10.85%, in line with the TTM period, as management has not provided specific guidance on operating margin expansion.
*   **Taxes:** We will use an effective tax rate of 20%, which is a conservative estimate based on the historical tax rates, which have been volatile.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** We will assume capex as a percentage of revenue remains constant at the TTM level of 2.36% (64.1 / 2718).
    *   **Working Capital:** We will model the change in working capital as a percentage of the change in revenue, using the TTM figure of -0.62% (-16.8 / (2718-1792)).
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   SBC is treated as a real cash expense and will be subtracted from FCFF.
    *   The diluted weighted-average share count of 332 million will be used.

#### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

We use Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) for our valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**FCFF Formula:**
EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

**FCFF Forecast (CHF, millions):**

| Year | Revenue | EBIT | NOPAT | D&A | SBC | Capex | Change in WC | FCFF |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 3,561 | 386.4 | 309.1 | 144.9 | 78.1 | 84.0 | -5.2 | 297.1 |
| 2 | 4,558 | 494.6 | 395.7 | 185.5 | 99.9 | 107.6 | -6.2 | 380.0 |
| 3 | 5,698 | 618.3 | 494.6 | 231.8 | 124.9 | 134.5 | -7.0 | 474.1 |
| 4 | 6,951 | 754.3 | 603.4 | 282.9 | 152.4 | 164.1 | -7.8 | 577.7 |
| 5 | 8,272 | 897.8 | 718.2 | 336.7 | 181.3 | 195.2 | -8.2 | 686.6 |

#### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 19, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (a standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.52 (TradingView, August 21, 2025). This beta reflects a higher volatility than the market, which is appropriate for a high-growth company in a competitive industry.
    *   **Cost of Equity:** 4.30% + 1.52 * 5.0% = 11.9%
*   **Cost of Debt:** We will infer the cost of debt from the interest expense and total debt: 17.9 / 497.8 = 3.6%. After a 20% tax shield, the after-tax cost of debt is 2.88%.
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Capitalization = 45.24 USD/share * 332 million shares = ~15,021 million USD = ~13,519 million CHF (using a 0.9 USD/CHF exchange rate).
    *   WACC = (13,519 / (13,519 + 497.8)) * 11.9% + (497.8 / (13,519 + 497.8)) * 2.88% = 11.5%

#### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (in line with long-term inflation expectations).
    *   **Terminal Value:** (686.6 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.115 - 0.025) = 7,816 CHF million
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = 897.8 (EBIT) + 336.7 (D&A) = 1,234.5 CHF million
    *   A conservative 10x EBITDA multiple results in a terminal value of 12,345 CHF million. Given the significant discrepancy, we will use the more conservative Gordon Growth terminal value.

#### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of FCFF = (297.1/1.115) + (380.0/1.115^2) + (474.1/1.115^3) + (577.7/1.115^4) + (686.6/1.115^5) = 1,777 CHF million
    *   PV of Terminal Value = 7,816 / (1.115^5) = 4,533 CHF million
    *   **Enterprise Value = 1,777 + 4,533 = 6,310 CHF million**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = 6,310 - (497.8 - 846.6) = 6,658.8 CHF million**

#### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** 6,658.8 CHF million / 332 million shares = **20.06 CHF per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** 20.06 CHF
    *   **Low/Bear Case (Slower Growth, Margin Compression):** 15 CHF
    *   **High/Bull Case (Sustained High Growth, Margin Expansion):** 28 CHF
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** 20.06 * (1 - 0.30) = **14.04 CHF**

#### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The sportswear market is intensely competitive, with established giants like Nike and Adidas.
2.  **Fashion Risk:** A significant portion of On's appeal is its fashion-forward design. Changes in consumer tastes could negatively impact sales.
3.  **Supply Chain:** Disruptions in the supply chain could impact inventory levels and gross margins.
4.  **Valuation:** The current market price implies very high growth expectations for a long period of time. Any deceleration in growth could lead to a significant stock price decline.
5.  **Currency Fluctuations:** As a Swiss company with a large portion of its sales in other currencies, On is exposed to foreign exchange risk.

final answer is 20.06 CHF
