**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a fast-food company, Wendy's R&D is focused on menu innovation and operational improvements rather than traditional research and development.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wendy's primarily operates through a franchise model, so its "sales organization" is its network of franchisees.

The company provides significant marketing and operational support to its franchisees to drive restaurant-level sales.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no significant disclosure of major labor disputes in recent filings. Wendy's has stated a commitment to fostering a positive and inclusive work environment. However, the fast-food industry is generally characterized by high employee turnover. Without specific data on Wendy's turnover rates compared to peers, it is difficult to definitively assess their labor relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Wendy's "Quality is Our Recipe" positioning and its use of fresh, never-frozen beef differentiates it from key competitors.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 30, 2025, Wendy's had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $649 million. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, indicating that it is not in need of equity financing for its growth initiatives.

**Synthesis:**
The Wendy's Company scores well on the majority of Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a strong brand, a clear growth strategy, and a stable management team. The company's key strengths lie in its product innovation, franchisee relationships, and long-term strategic focus. The primary area of uncertainty is in labor relations, a common challenge in the fast-food industry. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the success of its international expansion plans and the continued growth of its digital and breakfast platforms. A significant slowdown in same-restaurant sales growth or a major labor dispute could negatively impact the score.

fisher score is 14 / 15
