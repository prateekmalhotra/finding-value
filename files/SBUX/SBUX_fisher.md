**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

The company targets growing to 55,000 stores globally by 2030, with a focus on international expansion, particularly in China. They also see significant runway in growing their digital channels, which already account for 31% of transactions in U.S. company-operated stores as of Q3 2025.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is heavily invested in its "Triple Shot Reinvention" strategy, a multi-year plan focused on store efficiency, digital engagement, and product innovation. This includes a $3 billion efficiency program to fund investments in new equipment, such as the Siren System, to improve partner (employee) efficiency and increase store throughput. The company consistently introduces new beverages and food items, like the lavender-flavored drinks introduced in Spring 2025, to drive traffic and ticket growth. The ongoing evolution of the Starbucks Rewards program and mobile app is a core part of their strategy to retain and grow their customer base.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks does not disclose a specific R&D expense line item, making a direct comparison to peers on a percentage-of-revenue basis impossible. R&D is embedded within other operating expenses. The company's innovation is demonstrated through its rapid pace of new product launches (e.g., seasonal beverages, Oleato platform) and investments in equipment like the Mastrena X coffee machine. However, without clear financial disclosure on R&D spending and success-based metrics, it is difficult to definitively assess its effectiveness relative to the company's substantial scale.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a B2C company, the "sales organization" is its customer-facing channels and marketing. Starbucks excels in this area through its powerful digital ecosystem. The Starbucks Rewards loyalty program had over 35 million 90-day active members in the U.S. as of Q3 2025, a significant increase from the prior year. Mobile orders, delivery, and drive-thru now account for over 75% of revenue at U.S. company-operated stores. This digital flywheel, which captures customer data to personalize offers and drive repeat business, is a significant competitive advantage and represents a best-in-class sales platform in the restaurant industry.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q3 2025 earnings, Starbucks reported a consolidated non-GAAP operating margin of 16.5%, a decline of 120 basis points from the same period last year. This compression was attributed to strategic investments in labor and technology as part of the "Reinvention" plan, as well as inflationary pressures. While Starbucks historically commands strong margins, the recent trend has been negative. Compared to competitor McDonald's, which often reports operating margins in the 40%+ range, Starbucks's current margin is lower, though business models differ. Given the recent and persistent margin pressure, the answer is currently no.
**Answer:** No

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively addressing margin pressure through its "Triple Shot Reinvention" strategy, which includes a target of $3 billion in cost savings over three years. Key initiatives include supply chain efficiencies, optimizing store formats, and reducing waste. The rollout of the Siren System for beverage production is designed to decrease preparation times and increase throughput, improving store-level economics. The company also uses strategic price increases to offset inflation, demonstrating its pricing power.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks faces significant and ongoing challenges with labor relations. The Starbucks Workers United union has organized over 400 stores in the United States since 2021. The process has been contentious, involving numerous Unfair Labor Practice (ULP) charges filed with the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by both the union and the company. While Starbucks has made substantial investments in wages and benefits, raising the North American baristas' average hourly wage, the persistent and often acrimonious unionization campaign indicates that labor relations are far from "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Following a period of transition with the return and subsequent departure of Howard Schultz, the executive team under CEO Laxman Narasimhan has appeared stable. Key long-tenured executives remain, and the company has a clear succession plan in place for key roles. The board of directors is composed of experienced leaders from diverse backgrounds. There have been no recent reports of public disputes or significant turmoil among the senior leadership team or the board.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks has a deep bench of experienced executives leading its key business segments and functions. The leadership team profiled on its investor relations website includes not only the C-suite but also regional presidents for North America, Asia Pacific, and EMEA, as well as heads of major functional areas like technology and marketing. The company's ability to execute a complex global strategy relies on this layer of management beneath the CEO, suggesting significant operational depth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks provides detailed segment reporting for its North America, International, and Channel Development businesses, offering investors clear insight into performance drivers. The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2024. There is no recent history of material restatements or significant control weaknesses identified.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks's key competitive advantage lies in its unique combination of scale, brand equity, and a powerful digital ecosystem. Its real estate strategy of securing premier, high-traffic locations is a durable moat. The "third place" concept, while challenged by the shift to convenience, has built a powerful brand identity. Most importantly, the Starbucks Rewards program and mobile app create a sticky customer relationship that competitors struggle to replicate, providing valuable data and driving repeat business.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Triple Shot Reinvention with Two Pumps" strategy is explicit evidence of a long-range outlook. Management has guided to near-term margin pressure due to significant investments in store equipment, technology, and higher wages. These actions are designed to improve service speed, increase capacity, and enhance employee retention, with the expectation that they will lead to more durable revenue and profit growth in the long run. This willingness to sacrifice some near-term margin for future growth is a hallmark of a long-range perspective.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Starbucks has a strong balance sheet and generates significant cash flow from operations, reporting over $4 billion in operating cash flow for the nine months ended June 29, 2025. The company primarily funds its growth and capital returns through cash on hand and debt, having returned over $2.1 billion to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases in the same period. There is no indication that the company needs to or intends to issue equity to fund its strategic plans.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has been transparent about its recent challenges. On the Q3 2025 earnings call, executives directly addressed the operating margin compression, the slower-than-expected recovery in China, and the impact of a challenging macroeconomic environment on U.S. traffic. While the narrative is optimistic, they provide specific details on the headwinds they face and the steps they are taking to address them, which demonstrates a healthy level of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent major legal, regulatory, or accounting scandals involving Starbucks's senior management. The company has a code of conduct, and its financial reporting appears transparent and compliant with regulations. However, some might view the company's aggressive stance against unionization efforts as a matter of questionable integrity from an ethical standpoint, even if it is legally permissible. Given that Fisher's focus was primarily on financial and governance integrity, and with no evidence of fraud or major governance failures, the company passes this test.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**

Starbucks scores well on Fisher's framework, particularly in its long-term strategic vision, management depth, powerful sales platform, and financial strength. The company's "Triple Shot Reinvention" plan provides a clear, albeit costly, roadmap for future growth, demonstrating a willingness to invest for the long term. However, the analysis reveals three significant weaknesses that detract from a top score. The most pressing is the ongoing, contentious labor relations issue, which directly contradicts Fisher's ideal. Second, recent and persistent profit margin compression, driven by investments and inflation, raises questions about current profitability. Finally, a lack of specific disclosure on R&D effectiveness makes it difficult to assess the true productivity of its innovation spending. The score is most likely to improve in the next 12-24 months if the "Reinvention" plan begins to deliver clear, sustained operating margin expansion, and if the company successfully negotiates a broad contract with Workers United, which would flip the most definitive "No" answers to "Yes."

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
