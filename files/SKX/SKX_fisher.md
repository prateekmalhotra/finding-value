Primary Sources Reviewed: FY2024 10-K (filed February 27, 2025), Q1 2025 10-Q (filed April 25, 2025), Q2 2025 10-Q (filed July 25, 2025), and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (July 24, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers has a significant runway for growth, primarily through international expansion and continued growth in its Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel. The company aims to achieve $10 billion in annual sales by 2026, a target reiterated by management. International sales, which constituted approximately 60% of the total, show strong growth potential in markets like India and China. The expansion into new product categories, such as the successful launch of Skechers Football and performance basketball footwear, further broadens their total addressable market.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a strong commitment to product development and innovation. The company has successfully expanded its core comfort technology franchise with lines like "Hands-Free Slip-ins," which has seen broad global demand. Recent entries into competitive athletic categories, including football (soccer) and basketball, with athlete endorsements (e.g., Harry Kane, Julius Randle), show a clear strategy to capture new market segments. Continued investment in distribution and technology infrastructure, such as new distribution centers in India and Canada, supports this growth.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers does not disclose Research and Development expenses as a separate line item in its financial statements, making a direct quantitative comparison to peers difficult. Innovation is embedded within product design and development costs inside SG&A expenses. While the company has a strong track record of commercializing comfort-focused technologies like Arch Fit and Slip-ins, its R&D is more focused on consumer-centric design and materials than on fundamental technological research. Without clear metrics on R&D spending and output, it is difficult to definitively assess its effectiveness relative to its significant scale.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers possesses a robust and effective multi-channel sales organization. The company's sales grew 12.5% to $8 billion in fiscal 2024. Its global distribution network is a key strength, spanning wholesale partners in approximately 180 countries and a growing Direct-to-Consumer segment with 5,160 stores as of June 30, 2025. The continued double-digit growth in both the wholesale and DTC segments, particularly internationally, demonstrates the sales organization's ability to execute across diverse channels and geographies.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers maintains solid profit margins for its industry. For the fiscal year 2024, the company reported a gross margin of 52.6% and an operating margin of 10.1%. In the most recent quarter (Q2 2025), the gross margin improved further to 53.6%, demonstrating effective inventory management and favorable product mix. While its operating margin is lower than that of premium-focused competitors like Nike, it is strong for a company focused on the value and mid-tier market segment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers is actively working to improve margins through several initiatives. Management consistently highlights a strategic shift toward higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer sales, which grew 18.5% in the most recent quarter. They have also benefited from lower freight costs and have focused on maintaining healthy inventory levels to reduce the need for discounting. Favorable product mix, including the higher-priced new athletic footwear lines, and targeted price increases in certain markets also contribute to margin preservation and enhancement.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers discloses information on its human capital management, noting its global workforce of approximately 17,900 employees as of December 31, 2024. The company has not reported any significant labor disputes or unionization drives in its recent SEC filings. However, there is a lack of publicly available, detailed metrics on employee turnover, engagement scores, or other indicators that would be required to classify its labor relations as "outstanding" compared to peers. Without more concrete positive evidence, the standard cannot be met.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers has a highly stable, albeit family-dominated, senior executive team. Robert Greenberg is the founder, Chairman, and CEO, while his son Michael Greenberg is President and Co-Founder. Many senior executives have been with the company for over a decade, indicating a cohesive and long-serving leadership team. This stability suggests strong executive relations, though the concentration of control within the founding family could be a corporate governance concern for some investors.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a broad team of executives below the CEO and President, including a Chief Operating Officer (David Weinberg) and Chief Financial Officer (John Vandemore), who are key voices in investor communications. However, the long tenure and central role of the Greenberg family create a significant "key person" risk, which the company acknowledges in its 10-K. There is little public information regarding formal succession planning beyond the current leadership team, making it difficult to assess the depth of the next generation of management.

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers' accounting and cost controls appear robust. The company provides detailed financial reporting, with clear segmentation of sales by channel (Wholesale, DTC) and geography (Americas, EMEA, APAC). The auditor, KPMG LLP, has issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024, indicating no material weaknesses were found. There is no recent history of financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage for Skechers is its distinct brand positioning centered on comfort, style, and value, which appeals to a broader demographic than many high-performance athletic brands. The company's speed-to-market with trend-right products and its extensive network of wholesale partners and factory outlet stores allow it to effectively serve its target consumer. Furthermore, its endorsement strategy, which mixes major athletes with accessible celebrities, reinforces its broad appeal and is a unique aspect of its marketing model.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently emphasizes long-term strategic investments over short-term profit maximization. Their pursuit of the $10 billion sales goal by 2026 is the central long-range target. Significant capital expenditures on new, large-scale distribution centers in key international markets are made to support future growth, even if they increase operating expenses in the near term. Management's commentary on earnings calls frequently centers on building the brand and infrastructure for sustainable, long-term global growth.

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers has a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, minimizing the risk of shareholder dilution. As of June 30, 2025, the company held $1.45 billion in cash and cash equivalents against total debt of $590 million. It generates robust cash flow from operations ($456 million for the six months ended June 30, 2025). The company has an active share repurchase program, having bought back $25 million of its stock in the first half of 2025, further demonstrating it is not reliant on equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Skechers' management maintains a consistent and open dialogue with investors through quarterly earnings calls and presentations. On the Q2 2025 earnings call, executives addressed specific challenges, such as softness in certain European markets and the impact of foreign exchange headwinds, without obfuscation. They provide detailed guidance and answer analyst questions directly, even when they pertain to areas of weakness or competitive pressure. This transparency indicates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent, significant legal or regulatory actions against Skechers or its senior management that would call their integrity into question. A review of the company's legal proceedings disclosures in its 10-K and 10-Q filings reveals routine litigation common for a company of its size, but no red flags concerning management's character. The company has a code of ethics, and related-party transactions are disclosed and do not appear to be detrimental to shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Skechers scores well on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting strong fundamentals in growth runway, financial health, and strategic focus. The company's primary strengths lie in its clear path to growth through international expansion and its powerful, multi-channel sales organization. Its strong brand identity around comfort and value provides a defensible niche. The main weaknesses identified relate to a lack of transparency and potential risk in human capital areas: undisclosed R&D metrics, a lack of evidence for "outstanding" employee relations, and potential "key person" risk centered on the founding family. The score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on the success of its push into competitive performance athletic categories and its ability to sustain margin improvements amidst global economic uncertainty. A "No" for R&D Effectiveness would flip to "Yes" if the company began disclosing R&D spending and success metrics, while the "No" for Management Depth could be reversed by the announcement of a clear succession plan.

fisher score is 12 / 15
