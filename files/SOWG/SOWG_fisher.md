Sow Good Inc., August 20, 2025, Primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed March 27, 2025, and earnings call transcripts from May 14, 2025, and August 14, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good operates in the freeze-dried candy market, a segment poised for significant growth. The global freeze-dried candy market was valued at over $1.3 billion in 2023 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of over 8%, reaching over $2.3 billion by 2030. Sow Good's own 2024 annual report identifies the nascent freeze-dried candy market as an area with "exponential growth" potential and also notes adjacent categories like yogurt snacks and jerky as future growth opportunities. The company's revenue growth from $16.1 million in 2023 to $32.0 million in 2024 demonstrates its ability to capitalize on this growing market.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good's management has explicitly stated that "Innovation is at the heart of our company." The company's growth strategy includes expanding its product offerings into adjacent categories like yogurt snacks and jerky. Evidence of this commitment includes the rapid development and launch of their "Crunch Cream" line, which took only nine weeks from concept to market. Furthermore, the company has invested in its manufacturing capabilities, with six proprietary freeze driers and plans to operationalize six more by the end of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While Sow Good does not break out R&D spending as a separate line item, its effectiveness can be inferred from its product development and manufacturing capabilities. The company spent over two years and $10 million developing its manufacturing facility and proprietary freeze-drying technology before its commercial launch. The ability to rapidly innovate, exemplified by the nine-week launch of its Crunch Cream line, demonstrates an effective R&D process for a company of its size.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company achieved rapid distribution, placing its products in approximately 3,000 retail locations, including major chains like Five Below, Kroger, and Albertsons, leading to a 99% revenue increase in 2024. However, recent performance shows a significant weakness in defending its market share. The company's 2024 10-K and Q2 2025 earnings call both cite the loss of significant customers and shelf space due to exclusivity agreements with larger competitors, resulting in a steep decline in revenue. This indicates that while the sales team was effective at initial penetration, it has not been able to sustain its position against determined competition.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good's gross profit margin improved to 40.56% in 2024, up from 20.4% in 2023. This is a respectable margin within the broader candy industry, which sees margins ranging from 25% to over 50%. However, this has not been sustainable. The company's most recent quarterly report for Q2 2025 showed a negative gross margin of -7% due to increased competitive pressure. The company also continues to operate at a net loss.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good is pursuing margin improvement through vertical integration of its manufacturing and administrative functions to leverage fixed costs as volume increases. The company also anticipates achieving manufacturing efficiencies as its product portfolio grows. In the near term, management is focused on "cost optimization" and "right-sizing occupancy needs" to address the recent downturn in performance. However, these actions have yet to demonstrate a sustained positive impact on margins in the face of competitive pressures.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good's management states a commitment to providing a "living wage, an energizing working environment, full benefits, and stock options to every employee." The company has no employees covered by collective bargaining agreements and reports no history of work stoppages. These are positive indicators, but without further data on employee turnover or satisfaction, it is difficult to confirm if their relations are "outstanding".
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is led by its co-founders, who hold the top two executive positions. However, there has been recent turnover in the key role of Chief Financial Officer, with three different individuals holding the title (one permanent, one interim, one new permanent) between March and August 2025. This instability in a critical leadership position suggests potential issues in executive relations.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good's 10-K explicitly states that the business "depends substantially on the continuing efforts of our senior management and other key personnel, including Ira and Claudia Goldfarb," and that the loss of their services could "severely disrupt our business." This, combined with the recent turnover at the CFO position, indicates a significant key-person risk and a lack of management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The independent auditor's report in the 2024 10-K includes a "Going Concern Uncertainty" paragraph, citing the company's "recurring losses from operations" and concluding that this "raise[s] substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern." This is a major red flag from the auditors regarding the company's financial viability and controls. While management asserts that its disclosure controls and procedures are effective, the auditor's opinion is a more critical and objective assessment.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good's investment in proprietary freeze-drying technology and a high-quality, certified manufacturing facility are key differentiators in the food manufacturing industry. However, the company's recent struggles against larger competitors who have entered the freeze-dried candy market suggest that these advantages are not a sufficient moat to ensure long-term, outsized success. The ability to secure and maintain shelf space at major retailers appears to be a more critical factor in this industry.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated a willingness to invest for the long term, spending over $10 million on its manufacturing facility before the commercial launch of its products and continuing to invest in new capacity. Its stated growth strategy is focused on long-term goals like expanding its product line and distribution channels. These actions, which have resulted in near-term net losses, are consistent with a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good has a history of funding its operations through equity financing, including a private placement and a public offering in 2024. The 10-K's risk factors explicitly state that "Shareholders have been diluted in the past year," and the auditor's "going concern" opinion highlights the company's precarious financial position. Given the ongoing losses and the need for capital to fund growth, it is highly likely that the company will need to raise additional capital through equity financing, leading to further dilution.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed the significant challenges facing the company, including the steep revenue decline, negative gross margins, and increased competitive pressures. They directly addressed the "softer demand" and the "arrival of large market entrants" and outlined their strategy to "rebuild from a more resilient foundation." This level of transparency during a difficult period is a positive sign.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/14/sow-good-sowg-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/'](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/08/14/sow-good-sowg-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/) (August 14, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K discloses several related-party transactions, including the lease of the main facility from an entity owned by the Executive Chairman and various loans and stock purchases involving executives and their families. While these are disclosed and not illegal, a high number of such transactions can raise corporate governance concerns. However, there are no material legal proceedings or other findings to suggest a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm) (March 27, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Sow Good Inc. scores positively on its long-term vision, product innovation, and transparency with investors. The company is operating in a high-growth niche of the consumer staples market and has demonstrated an ability to innovate and expand its production capacity. However, these positives are overshadowed by significant negatives. The company's financial position is precarious, as evidenced by the auditor's "going concern" opinion, and it is heavily reliant on its co-founders. Most critically, the recent collapse in revenue and gross margins due to the entry of larger competitors raises serious questions about the sustainability of its business model and the effectiveness of its sales organization.

The Fisher score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the company's ability to regain and defend its shelf space against larger competitors, and its success in diversifying its product line into new categories like yogurt and jerky. Evidence that would flip a "No" to a "Yes" would include a return to sustained positive gross margins, the announcement of significant new distribution agreements with major retailers, and a stabilization of the executive team, particularly the CFO role. Without these, the company's long-term prospects remain highly uncertain.

**fisher score is 7 / 15**
