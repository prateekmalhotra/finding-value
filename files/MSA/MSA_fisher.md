MSA Safety Incorporated, August 20, 2025, analysis based on Q2 2025 earnings reports, 2024 annual results, and investor presentations.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MSA Safety operates in the growing industrial safety market, with demand driven by strengthening global safety standards, such as the EU's Green Deal and U.S. EPA mandates. The company is expanding its addressable market through strategic acquisitions like M&C TechGroup, which added a $500 million opportunity in gas analysis systems. While the company projects modest low single-digit organic growth for 2025, it has set a long-term organic revenue target of $2.1–$2.3 billion by 2028, representing a significant increase from its $1.8 billion revenue in 2024. This growth is supported by a strategic focus on connected, subscription-based services like the MSA+ platform, which creates a recurring revenue model.

**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MSA Safety demonstrates a strong commitment to innovation, investing approximately 4.5% of its sales into R&D. The company is strategically shifting towards connected, AI-driven solutions like the Altair io4 gas detector, which is supported by the MSA+ subscription platform to generate recurring revenue. MSA proactively develops products to meet future regulations, such as the G1 XR SCBA designed for upcoming NFPA standards, securing a first-mover advantage. In 2024, new products accounted for approximately 15% of the company's total revenue, demonstrating a successful and continuous development pipeline.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MSA consistently invests in R&D, with spending of approximately $67 million on $1.8 billion of revenue in 2024 (~3.7%), and a stated goal of 4.5% of sales. While direct R&D spending comparisons to competitors' safety divisions are difficult due to their conglomerate structures, MSA's R&D *output* is highly effective. New products contributed to 15% of revenue in 2024, and the company maintains a product vitality ratio of 37%. The successful, proactive launch of products like the G1 XR SCBA ahead of regulatory deadlines and the strategic development of recurring-revenue platforms demonstrate a highly efficient use of its R&D budget.

The company also engages in proactive supply chain management, such as accelerating shipments to mitigate tariff impacts, to protect profitability.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** MSA has been named a "Top Workplace" in its headquarters region of Western Pennsylvania for 11 consecutive years, an award based entirely on employee feedback surveys. This consistent recognition highlights high levels of employee engagement, effective leadership, and a strong connection to the company's mission.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MSA Safety has demonstrated a stable and thoughtfully planned leadership structure. The company recently executed a smooth CEO succession, with Steve Blanco taking over in May 2024 from Nish Vartanian, who remains as Non-Executive Chairman, ensuring continuity. The executive team exhibits significant industry experience and longevity with the company, indicating low turnover at the highest levels. This stability, combined with a clear succession process, points to strong and healthy executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MSA's leadership structure shows considerable depth beyond the CEO. The company has distinct presidents for its Americas and International segments, as well as a Chief Product and Technology Officer, indicating clear lines of authority and expertise across key operational areas. The recent CEO succession was an internal promotion, with Steve Blanco previously serving as President and COO, which suggests the company cultivates a strong bench of internal talent. The presence of experienced leaders in critical roles like finance, legal, and HR further supports the assessment of management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Evidence for this point is indirect but positive. The company's ability to provide detailed segment performance, maintain strong margins, and execute a formal "MSA Business System" for resource allocation suggests robust internal controls and cost analysis. There is no evidence from SEC filings or news reports of material weaknesses, internal control issues, or financial restatements. The company has consistently filed its financial reports on time and has a long history as a public entity, implying well-established and reliable accounting systems.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**
*Citation Not Found: Inferred from the absence of negative indicators in financial reports and news searches.*

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the safety equipment industry, regulatory certification (e.g., from NIOSH, NFPA) is a significant barrier to entry and a critical competitive factor. MSA has demonstrated a key strength in developing and launching new products that meet or exceed upcoming standards before they are required, giving them a first-mover advantage. A prime example is the G1 XR SCBA, which aligns with future NFPA standards, allowing customers to upgrade early. This proactive, compliance-driven innovation is a crucial differentiator that builds a loyal customer base and a reputation for technological leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear long-range focus. At its May 2024 Investor Day, the company issued 2028 financial targets for revenue, adjusted operating margin, and adjusted EPS, providing a clear long-term framework for investors. The strategy emphasizes building recurring revenue streams through connected solutions and making disciplined M&A, both of which require upfront investment for long-term payoff. The company's 55-year history of consecutive dividend increases also necessitates a consistent, long-range approach to capital allocation and profitability rather than a focus on short-term gains.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** MSA Safety has a strong balance sheet and generates robust cash flow, minimizing the risk of dilutive equity financing. The company's net leverage ratio was a low 0.7x as of Q2 2025. Free cash flow conversion was 60% in the same quarter, providing ample capital for reinvestment and shareholder returns. The company actively returns capital to shareholders, having repurchased $30 million of its stock in Q2 2025 and raising its dividend for the 55th consecutive year, actions that are contrary to a company that would need to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its communications. In its Q2 2025 results, while reporting a sales beat, the company was transparent about challenges, noting that growth was acquisition-driven while organic growth was flat, and openly discussed margin erosion and weakness in the Fire Service segment. The company maintains its full-year guidance but is also clear about the potential risks from macroeconomic factors and the timing of regulatory approvals. This balanced presentation of both positives and negatives indicates a culture of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of significant legal or regulatory issues, scandals, or governance red flags associated with MSA's management. The company has operated for over a century and has a long, stable history as a public entity. Its consistent recognition as a top workplace, which includes an award for its "Values," suggests a culture that prioritizes ethical behavior. The absence of integrity-related issues, combined with a positive corporate culture, supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
MSA Safety scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its status as a high-quality, market-leading industrial company. Its strongest attributes are its dominant market share in key niches, a clear and effective R&D strategy that drives growth through premium products, and a robust financial profile with strong margins and cash flow. The company's outstanding personnel relations and stable, transparent management team further solidify its high quality. The primary variable that could change the score in the next 12–24 months is the execution of its growth strategy. While the long-term runway is evident, current organic growth is flat. A failure to re-accelerate organic growth toward its mid-single-digit target could call into question the effectiveness of its sales and R&D efforts, potentially turning the "Yes" for points 1, 3, or 4 into a "No" if the modest growth persists despite a healthy market.

fisher score is 15 / 15
