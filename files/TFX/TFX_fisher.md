**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

These margins are healthy for the medical device industry.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the medical device industry, a key clue to a company's strength is its ability to innovate and navigate the complex regulatory environment. Teleflex's focus on Class I and Class II medical devices, which generally have a shorter and less costly 510(k) clearance process, is a strategic advantage that reduces R&D risk and time-to-market compared to Class III devices. The company's diverse portfolio of trusted brands also provides a competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes

The company's strategic initiatives, such as the acquisition of the BIOTRONIK Vascular Intervention business and the planned separation of NewCo, indicate a focus on long-term value creation.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2024, Teleflex had $238.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company has a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility and has demonstrated the ability to access debt markets for strategic acquisitions.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q1 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed the earnings miss, the year-over-year revenue decline, and the challenges in its UroLift and OEM businesses. The company also detailed the expected impact of tariffs and its mitigation strategies. This transparency in the face of challenges suggests a commitment to candid communication with investors.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no indications of significant legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or other governance red flags in the reviewed SEC filings. The company has a code of ethics and a robust compliance program. While an ongoing matter related to an Italian "payback" measure exists, it appears to be a broader industry issue rather than a specific integrity concern for Teleflex's management.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**
Teleflex Incorporated scores well on the Fisher 15-point checklist, demonstrating strengths across its product portfolio, management team, and financial controls. The company's commitment to innovation, strategic acquisitions, and operational efficiency initiatives position it for continued growth. The planned separation of its NewCo unit and the integration of the recently acquired BIOTRONIK Vascular Intervention business will be key variables to watch over the next 12-24 months. A successful integration of the BIOTRONIK business, delivering on the expected revenue and cost synergies, would further solidify the company's growth trajectory. Conversely, any significant challenges in the NewCo separation or a sustained downturn in key product lines like UroLift could negatively impact the score.

fisher score is 15 / 15
