### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** The value of Levi's products does not increase for a consumer as more people use them. Apparel is a broadcast medium for personal expression, not an interconnected network. There are no direct or indirect network effects present in the business model.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is based on designing, marketing, and selling apparel products directly to consumers or through wholesale partners. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for consumers are exceptionally low, limited only to minor behavioral preferences for a specific fit or style. The company's wholesale relationships are also transactional, operating on an order-by-order basis without long-term contracts, which indicates low switching costs for retail partners.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states it does not have long-term contracts with its wholesale customers and that purchases "generally occur on an order-by-order basis." (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
*   The global apparel industry is described as "highly competitive and fragmented" with "low barriers to entry," which is indicative of low switching costs. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** Levi's has significant global scale, but there is no direct evidence of a sustainable per-unit cost advantage over similarly-sized global peers. The company's gross margin of 62.3% (for the six months ended June 1, 2025) is strong but appears to be driven more by the brand's pricing power than a structurally lower cost base. The company sources from approximately 28 countries, providing diversification and risk mitigation but not a proprietary low-cost advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   Gross profit was 62.3% of net revenues for the six months ended June 1, 2025, an improvement driven by lower product costs and favorable channel mix. (Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended June 1, 2025)
*   The company sources nearly all products through independent contract manufacturers located in approximately 28 countries, with no more than 30% from any single country. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** This is Levi's most significant competitive advantage. The Levi's brand is globally recognized and has been cultivated for over 170 years, representing authenticity and heritage that allows for premium pricing. Key trademarks like the 501®, the Arcuate Stitching Design, and the Red Tab Device are iconic, legally protected, and provide a strong defense against direct imitation.
**Evidence:**
*   The company regards its trademarks as "one of its most valuable assets," with over 6,100 trademark registrations in approximately 180 jurisdictions worldwide. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
*   The Levi's® brand accounts for the vast majority of business, representing 94% of net revenues from continuing operations in the first six months of 2025. (Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended June 1, 2025)
*   As of December 1, 2024, the company held 82 issued U.S. patents expiring between 2025 and 2043. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** Levi's possesses a formidable global distribution network, selling products in approximately 50,000 retail locations across 120 countries. The strategic shift to a "DTC First" model, with the DTC channel now representing over 50% of revenue, provides direct consumer access and better margin control. This extensive and increasingly direct-to-consumer network creates a moderate barrier to entry for new players trying to achieve similar global scale.
**Evidence:**
*   Products are sold in approximately 50,000 retail locations worldwide, including approximately 3,200 brand-dedicated stores and shop-in-shops as of June 1, 2025. (Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended June 1, 2025)
*   The Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel generated 51% of net revenues for the six months ended June 1, 2025. (Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended June 1, 2025)
*   The company is changing its distribution strategy to a mix of owned and third-party operated distribution centers as part of its "Project Fuel" initiative. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** The growth of the DTC channel provides Levi's with valuable direct consumer data on preferences and purchasing behavior. However, there is no evidence this dataset is unique or hard to replicate compared to other large, global apparel retailers who are pursuing similar DTC strategies. The company's filings mention data analytics as a competitive factor but do not detail a proprietary data asset that creates a durable advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The company identifies adapting to changes in technology, "including the successful utilization of data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning," as a principal competitive factor. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
*   The company's e-commerce sites represented 12% of total net revenues in the first six months of 2025, providing a direct source of consumer data. (Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended June 1, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** Levi's operates a traditional product manufacturing and sales model. There is no evidence of an external ecosystem of third-party developers, complementary product marketplaces, or platform effects that would enhance the value of its core products.
**Evidence:**
*   The business description focuses entirely on the design, marketing, and sale of company-branded apparel and accessories through wholesale and DTC channels. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The global apparel industry is not characterized by significant regulatory or legal barriers that would prevent new competition. While the company must comply with numerous trade, customs, and labor laws, these are requirements for all participants and do not confer a specific competitive advantage on Levi's.
**Evidence:**
*   The company notes that its import operations are subject to "complex trade and customs laws, regulations and tax requirements such as sanctions orders or tariffs," which it lists as a risk factor, not a competitive advantage. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 0 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** The apparel business has relatively low capital intensity, as evidenced by Levi's capital expenditures representing approximately 3.6% of FY2024 revenue. The company's increasing reliance on third-party manufacturing and logistics further reduces asset specificity and the sunk costs required to compete, making this a weak source of competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2024 were USD 227.5 million on net revenues of USD 6,355.3 million. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
*   The company is transitioning from an owned-and-operated distribution model to a mix of owned and third-party operated centers. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** Revenue is almost entirely transactional. The DTC channel is by definition transactional, and wholesale business is conducted on an "order-by-order basis" with no long-term contracts. This provides very low revenue visibility.
**Evidence:**
*   The company states its relationships with wholesale customers are not governed by long-term contracts. (Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
*   DTC sales, which are 51% of revenue, are inherently transactional. (Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended June 1, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5

**Numeric Weighted Score:** 13.7 / 100

### Mapping
The weighted score of 13.7 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range.
**Final Integer Moat Rating:** 1 / 5

### Moat Duration Justification
The company's narrow moat is derived almost exclusively from its intangible assets, specifically the Levi's brand. The brand's strength has endured for over a century and allows for premium pricing. However, the apparel industry is subject to shifting consumer tastes and intense competition. The estimated moat duration of 5-8 years reflects the durability of the brand, tempered by the risk of fashion cycles and the potential for brand relevance to erode over a medium-term horizon.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Brand Relevance Fades:** A failure to innovate and connect with younger generations could cause the Levi's brand to be perceived as dated, eroding its pricing power, which is its primary moat source. (Risk Factors, Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
2.  **DTC Execution Failure:** The "DTC First" strategy fails to deliver expected margin benefits or superior customer experience, leading to high fixed costs and channel conflict, damaging profitability and the distribution advantage. (Risk Factors, Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)
3.  **Intensifying Competition:** Increased competition from vertically-integrated fast-fashion retailers, private-label brands, and emerging e-commerce players leads to market share loss and forces greater promotional activity, compressing gross margins. (Risk Factors, Form 10-K for the Fiscal Year Ended December 1, 2024)

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Gross Margin %:** A decline could indicate eroding pricing power (moat weakening). Stability or an increase suggests the brand's value is intact (moat strengthening).
2.  **DTC as % of Total Revenue:** Continued growth toward the company's strategic goal strengthens the distribution moat and data collection. Stagnation or decline would be a negative indicator.
3.  **SG&A as % of Revenue:** An increasing ratio could signal diseconomies of scale or inefficient DTC investment, eroding profitability.
4.  **Inventory Turnover:** A slowing turnover rate may suggest a mismatch between product and consumer demand, a leading indicator of waning brand relevance.
5.  **Marketing Spend as % of Revenue:** A significant increase required to maintain sales could signal the brand's organic pull is weakening.
6.  **Revenue Growth in Levi's® Brand (Women's and Tops):** Success in these strategic diversification areas would indicate brand elasticity and strengthening. Failure to grow beyond men's bottoms is a risk.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Levi Strauss & Co. possesses a narrow economic moat rooted in the intangible asset of its iconic Levi's brand. This brand power enables premium pricing and has fostered consumer loyalty for generations, justifying a moat rating above zero. However, this is the sole significant advantage in a highly competitive, fragmented, and low-switching-cost industry. The company's moat is therefore not wide; it is vulnerable to the whims of fashion and failures in execution. A sustained decline in gross margins or a failure to successfully execute its DTC-centric strategy would be evidence of moat erosion and could cause the rating to be flipped to zero.

moat rating is 1 / 5
