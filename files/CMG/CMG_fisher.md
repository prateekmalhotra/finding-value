**Primary Sources Reviewed:** 2024 Annual Report (10-K), Q2 2025 Earnings Transcript, and various news/trade sources.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle continues to have a significant growth runway. The company is expanding its restaurant footprint in North America, with a long-term goal of 7,000 locations, a substantial increase from the 3,726 open at the end of 2024. International expansion is in its early stages and represents a major opportunity, with new locations opening in the Middle East and a planned entry into Mexico in 2026. While recent comparable sales have slowed, management anticipates a return to positive transaction growth in the second half of 2025, driven by marketing and new menu innovations. Digital sales remain a strong contributor, accounting for 35.5% of food and beverage revenue in the second quarter of 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle is actively pursuing product and process development. On the product side, the company is focused on menu innovation, particularly with limited-time offerings (LTOs) like Chipotle Honey Chicken and new dips like Adobo Ranch, which have shown success in driving sales. On the process side, Chipotle is investing in technology and automation to improve operational efficiency. This includes new kitchen equipment like dual-sided grills and produce slicers, as well as exploring automation for tasks like avocado processing (Autocado) and automated digital makelines (Hyphen). The company is also expanding its "Chipotlane" digital order pickup format, with over 80% of new restaurants in 2025 expected to include one.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle's R&D is not disclosed as a separate line item in its financial statements, as is common in the restaurant industry. Instead, R&D is embedded in operational initiatives and menu development. The company's innovation is focused on kitchen equipment, automation, and menu LTOs rather than basic research. While there is no direct R&D to revenue percentage to compare with peers, the effectiveness of its development efforts can be seen in the successful rollout of Chipotlanes, digital sales growth, and the positive sales impact of new menu items.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle's sales are generated through its restaurants, with a strong emphasis on digital channels. The company's marketing and digital teams function as its sales organization. Digital sales accounted for 35.5% of food and beverage revenue in the second quarter of 2025. The Chipotle Rewards loyalty program has grown to 40 million members and is a key tool for driving engagement and sales. The company's "Summer of Extras" rewards program engaged 5 million participants and increased visit frequency among lower-visit customers.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle has historically maintained strong profit margins. For the full year 2024, the restaurant-level operating margin was 26.7%, and the operating margin was 16.9%. In the second quarter of 2025, the restaurant-level operating margin was 27.4%, and the operating margin was 18.2%. These margins are considered strong within the restaurant industry. The company's net profit margin for the twelve months ending June 30, 2025 was 13.32%.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle is taking several actions to maintain and improve profit margins. The company is investing in technology and automation to improve operational efficiency and reduce costs, including new kitchen equipment and exploring automation. The company has also demonstrated pricing power, implementing menu price increases to offset inflation in food, beverage, and packaging costs. Additionally, the expansion of Chipotlanes is expected to improve margins, as these formats have higher sales and profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle has faced some labor challenges. The company has been the subject of unionization efforts, with one store in Lansing, Michigan voting to unionize in 2022. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) has found merit in claims that Chipotle illegally withheld raises from unionized workers. However, the company reports that hourly turnover has been improving, decreasing from 194% in 2021 to 131% in 2024. Chipotle has also invested in employee benefits, including debt-free degrees and tuition reimbursement.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle has experienced some recent high-level executive turnover. In August 2024, the previous CEO departed, and Scott Boatwright was appointed as the new CEO in November 2024. In May 2025, the company announced a shuffle in its leadership team, with a new COO and other executive changes. The company has a succession plan in place and has emphasized a focus on leadership development.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle has a deep management team with experience from other major restaurant and retail companies. The company recently appointed a new COO, Jason Kidd, who has over 25 years of experience, including leadership roles at Taco Bell and Sam's Club. The company's executive team also includes a Chief Financial Officer, Chief Brand Officer, and President, Chief Strategy and Technology Officer. The company has a focus on leadership development and internal promotion, with over 85% of in-restaurant leadership roles filled through internal promotions in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle's 2024 10-K includes a report from their independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, which gives an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed breakdowns of its restaurant operating costs, including food, beverage and packaging, labor, occupancy, and other operating costs, as a percentage of revenue in its quarterly and annual reports.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle has several competitive advantages. Its "Food with Integrity" philosophy, which emphasizes fresh, high-quality ingredients, resonates with consumers and has helped the company build a strong brand. The company has a strong digital presence, with a popular loyalty program and a growing number of "Chipotlane" digital order pickup locations, which enhance convenience and drive sales. The company's focus on a simple, customizable menu allows for operational efficiency and high throughput.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle has a long-range growth outlook. The company is focused on its long-term goal of reaching 7,000 restaurants in North America and is in the early stages of international expansion. The company is investing in technology and automation, such as new kitchen equipment and automated makelines, which may have short-term costs but are expected to improve long-term profitability. The company has also shown a willingness to invest in its brand and employees, with initiatives like its debt-free degree program.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle has a strong financial position. As of December 31, 2024, the company had $2.2 billion in cash and marketable investments and no debt. The company generates strong free cash flow, with a Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow ratio of 40.93 as of August 16, 2025. The company has a share repurchase program in place, with $1.0 billion remaining available for repurchases as of December 31, 2024. This indicates that the company is more likely to buy back shares than issue new ones.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1058090/000105809025000014/cmg-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1058090/000105809025000014/cmg-20241231.htm) (February 5, 2025), [https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pfcfratio/CMG/Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow/Chipotle-Mexican-Grill](https://www.gurufocus.com/term/pfcfratio/CMG/Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow/Chipotle-Mexican-Grill) (August 16, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle's management communicates regularly with investors through quarterly earnings calls, SEC filings, and investor presentations. In its Q2 2025 earnings release, management acknowledged the decline in comparable restaurant sales and transactions, attributing it to a challenging consumer environment, but also highlighted a return to positive comparable sales in June and expressed optimism for the second half of the year. The company's investor relations website provides access to press releases, SEC filings, and event webcasts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://ir.chipotle.com/investor-relations](https://ir.chipotle.com/investor-relations) (Accessed August 24, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chipotle's Board of Directors has established Corporate Governance Guidelines that outline the Board's responsibilities, including overseeing the performance and integrity of the company and its senior management. The company also has a Code of Ethics that applies to all employees and directors. While the company has faced legal challenges related to labor practices, there is no evidence of widespread or systemic issues with management integrity. The company has a history of being a "darling of both Wall Street and its customer base" and has built a brand around its "Food with Integrity" mission.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**
Chipotle scores well on Fisher's 15-point checklist, with strong marks for its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and financial strength. The company's "Food with Integrity" ethos and strong brand create a significant competitive advantage. The primary area of concern is in labor relations, where unionization efforts and legal challenges could pose a risk. The recent slowdown in comparable sales is a key variable to watch in the next 12-24 months. A sustained rebound in transaction growth, successful international expansion, and continued margin improvement from operational efficiencies would solidify the company's high Fisher score. A "No" on labor relations could flip to a "Yes" with a resolution of the current labor disputes and a demonstrated commitment to positive union relations.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
