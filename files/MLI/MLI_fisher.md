Mueller Industries, Inc., August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 29, 2025, and an investor presentation from May 2024.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mueller's products are essential for critical infrastructure in diverse sectors, including plumbing, HVACR, industrial manufacturing, and electrical. The company holds a #1 or #2 market position in its core products. A significant portion of its sales is tied to the construction, and repair and remodeling markets. The May 2024 investor presentation highlights the company's diversified market exposure which provides a long runway for growth. The recent acquisition of Nehring Electrical Works Company in May 2024 provides a substantial platform for expansion in the energy infrastructure space.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mueller has a successful track record of growth through acquisitions, with representative acquisitions totaling $210 million providing geographic expansion and growth. The company’s acquisition of Nehring Electrical Works in May 2024 for approximately $569.2 million and Elkhart Products Corporation in August 2024 for approximately $38.2 million demonstrates a commitment to expanding its product portfolio and market reach. The company's capital expenditures were $80.2 million in 2024, with a forecast of $70.0 to $80.0 million for 2025, indicating continued investment in its operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025), [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf) (May 2024)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mueller's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, states that "expenditures for Company-sponsored research and development activities were not material during 2024, 2023, or 2022." The company's growth strategy appears to be more focused on acquisitions and operational execution rather than internal R&D. While this is not necessarily a negative, it does not provide evidence of effective R&D efforts relative to its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company sells its products through a combination of its own sales and distribution organization, which has a broad geographic market representation, and a complement of agents. This hybrid approach allows for wide market coverage. The company’s market-leading position in its core products suggests an effective sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025), [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf) (May 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, Mueller reported a gross margin of 27.7% and an operating margin of 20.4%. These margins demonstrate strong profitability. The company's investor presentation from May 2024 highlights its strong operating margins and cash flow.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025), [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf) (May 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mueller's strategy for maintaining and improving margins revolves around operational execution. The company attempts to pass through increases in raw material costs to customers. Additionally, Mueller's acquisition strategy is focused on purchasing companies that will enhance its value proposition and improve long-term profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 28, 2024, approximately 35% of Mueller's employees were represented by various unions. The company states in its 10-K that "We consider our relationship with our employees to be good" and that it "expects to renew its union contracts without material disruption to its operations." This suggests stable, if not outstanding, labor relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's definitive proxy statement would provide the most insight into executive relations, but it is not among the provided documents. However, the existing documents do not indicate any issues with executive relations. The company has a clear leadership structure, and there are no reports of significant executive turnover or disputes.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** No evidence found.

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K lists its executive officers, indicating a team of experienced individuals with long tenures at the company. However, a detailed analysis of management depth would require a review of the company's proxy statement, which is not available. Without further information on succession planning and the management team beyond the named executive officers, it's difficult to definitively assess the depth of management.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, includes a positive attestation from its independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The report states that "Mueller Industries, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2024". There is no mention of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mueller's vertical integration, from raw material processing to finished goods, provides a competitive advantage in managing costs and supply chain. The company's ability to pass through raw material cost fluctuations to customers is a key factor in its profitability and resilience. Furthermore, its global footprint with manufacturing and distribution facilities in North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East allows it to serve a diverse customer base and mitigate regional economic downturns.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025), [https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf](https://d18rn0p25nwr6d.cloudfront.net/CIK-0000089439/86259e8e-6e8a-44c1-881b-506041a3d242.pdf) (May 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Mueller’s consistent profitability for over 30 years and its strategy of growth through acquisitions indicate a long-range outlook. The company's willingness to make significant acquisitions, such as Nehring, demonstrates a focus on long-term value creation over short-term profits. Management's discussion in the 10-K emphasizes a long-term strategy of operational execution and disciplined use of capital.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.muellerindustries.com/investors](https://www.muellerindustries.com/investors) (2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 29, 2025, Mueller had $830.1 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company has a strong balance sheet with a current ratio of 4.3 to 1. The company has a share repurchase program in place, having repurchased approximately 19.0 million shares from its initial authorization in 1999 through March 29, 2025, which is anti-dilutive. Given its strong cash position and low debt, the company is well-positioned to fund its growth without resorting to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000019/mli-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000019/mli-20250329.htm) (April 23, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company launched a new investor relations website in September 2022 to provide enhanced access to investor resources, including financial information, company news, and an investor presentation. This suggests a commitment to transparency with investors. The company's SEC filings provide detailed information about its operations, including risk factors and challenges. Without access to earnings call transcripts, it is difficult to fully assess management's candor in real-time discussions, but the available information suggests a willingness to communicate openly.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K includes a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including senior executives. There is no evidence in the provided documents of any significant legal or regulatory issues, related-party transactions, or governance red flags that would question the integrity of management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89439/000008943925000010/mli-20241228.htm) (February 26, 2025)

**Synthesis**

Mueller Industries scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its market leadership, profitability, and financial strength. The company's commitment to growth through acquisitions, particularly in the energy infrastructure space, provides a clear path for future expansion. The two main areas where the score could change in the next 12-24 months are R&D effectiveness and management depth. A "No" on R&D could be flipped to a "Yes" with evidence of increased investment and successful new product launches that are not the result of acquisitions. A "No" on management depth could be flipped with more disclosure on succession planning and the management team beyond the C-suite. A detailed review of the company's proxy statement would be necessary to get a clearer picture of executive relations and management depth.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
