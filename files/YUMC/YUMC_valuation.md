### B) Management Guidance Extraction
Key guidance from the Q2 2025 earnings call on August 5, 2025:
*   **System Sales Growth:** "System Sales grew 4% year-over-year, within the range of our full-year target... we remain confident in achieving our full year targets for 2025, including... system sales growth." This implies a mid-single-digit growth target.
*   **New Store Openings:** "Given the progress we have achieved in the first half of the year, we are raising our 2025 target from the previous 1,500 to 1,700 locations."
*   **Margin Outlook:** "...we remain confident in achieving our full year targets for 2025, including... margin expansion."

---

### C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)
*   **Revenue Growth:** Year 1 growth is set to 4.5%, the midpoint of management's "mid-single-digit" guidance. The rate is then tapered down to 3.0% by Year 5 to reflect the law of large numbers.
*   **Operating Margin:** A constant 11.25% operating margin is used, representing a modest improvement from the TTM figure of 11.09%, consistent with management's stated goal of margin expansion.
*   **Tax Rate:** The effective tax rate is assumed to be 27.0%, normalizing the TTM rate of 26.9% and the average of the last three full years (27.9%).
*   **Capex:** Modeled at 6.0% of annual revenue, which is in line with the 3-year historical average (5.3% to 6.5%).
*   **Working Capital:** Change in Working Capital is forecast at 30.0% of the *change* in revenue, based on a normalized historical relationship.

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD millions) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | **$11,948** | **$12,426** | **$12,861** | **$13,311** | **$13,710** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   Risk-Free Rate: **4.33%** (Source: U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   Equity Risk Premium: **5.00%** (Standard market premium)
    *   Beta (5Y): **0.26** (Source: StockAnalysis.com). A beta this low is justified by the company's stable, consumer-defensive business model within a specific geographic market (China), making it less correlated with the global market index.
    *   *Calculation: Ke = 4.33% + 0.26 \* 5.00% = **5.63%***
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Pre-Tax Cost of Debt: **4.50%** (Estimated based on company's stability)
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt: *4.50% \* (1 - 27.0%) = **3.29%***
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity: **$17,134 million** ($45.09 price \* 380 million shares)
    *   Market Value of Debt: **$2,235 million**
    *   *Calculation: WACC = (17,134 / 19,369) \* 5.63% + (2,235 / 19,369) \* 3.29% = **5.35%***

### F) Terminal Value
*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.50%**. This rate is selected to be in line with long-term global inflation expectations and represents a realistic estimate for a mature company.
    *   Year 5 FCFF: **$688 million**
    *   *Terminal Value = ($688 \* (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0535 - 0.025) = **$24,763 million***
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $1,542M + $552M = $2,094M.
    *   Implied Exit Multiple = $24,763M / $2,094M = **11.8x**. This is a reasonable multiple for a stable, large-cap restaurant company, confirming the Gordon Growth assumptions are sound.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge
*   **Present Value of FCFF (Years 1-5):**
    *   PV = (549/1.0535¹) + (588/1.0535²) + (626/1.0535³) + (649/1.0535⁴) + (688/1.0535⁵) = **$2,646 million**
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:**
    *   PV = 24,763 / (1.0535⁵) = **$19,052 million**
*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   *Enterprise Value = $2,646 million + $19,052 million = **$21,698 million***
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Short-Term Investments = $2,235M - $592M - $1,582M = **$61 million**
    *   *Equity Value = $21,698 million - $61 million = **$21,637 million***

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety
*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   *Value per Share = $21,637 million / 380 million shares = **$56.94***
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $56.94.** This assumes management meets its mid-single-digit growth targets with modest margin expansion.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$42.** This scenario assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 2-3% annually) and margin compression due to heightened competition, resulting in a lower terminal value.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$75.** This scenario assumes sustained high-single-digit growth and significant margin expansion driven by successful new store formats and premiumization.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a margin of safety.
    *   *MOS Price = $56.94 \* (1 - 0.30) = **$39.86***

### I) Risk Notes
1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** YUMC's performance is highly dependent on consumer spending in China, which can be impacted by economic slowdowns, geopolitical tensions, or unforeseen public health events.
2.  **Intense Competition:** The Chinese restaurant industry is extremely competitive, with pressure from both international and local brands, which could limit pricing power and market share gains.
3.  **Food Safety & Supply Chain:** Any disruption or perceived lapse in food safety standards could significantly damage brand reputation and lead to a sharp decline in sales.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** Changes in Chinese government regulations regarding labor, food safety, or foreign business operations could adversely affect profitability.

final answer is 56.94 $
