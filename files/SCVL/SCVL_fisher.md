### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shoe Carnival is actively pursuing growth on multiple fronts to gain market share in the U.S. family footwear segment. The company's primary growth driver is its "Rebanner Strategy," which involves converting underperforming Shoe Carnival stores to its more productive and higher-growth Shoe Station banner. A 10-store test of this strategy in Fiscal 2024 yielded a sales and profit lift of over 10%, prompting a plan to rebanner 175 stores over the next 24 months. By Fiscal 2027, the company expects these rebannered stores to achieve over 10% higher net sales and 20% higher profit contribution. This organic growth is supplemented by strategic acquisitions, such as the February 2024 purchase of Rogan's, which established a market-leading position in Wisconsin and a new base for expansion in the upper Midwest.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to evolving its business model through significant investments and strategic initiatives. The acquisitions of Shoe Station in 2021 and Rogan's in 2024 show a clear intent to grow via M&A. The large-scale "Rebanner Strategy" represents a major process development aimed at optimizing the store fleet and better aligning with target demographics. Furthermore, the company is investing heavily in its digital presence, having relaunched both of its primary e-commerce sites on a single, modern platform in Fiscal 2023. For Fiscal 2025, the company has planned capital expenditures of $45 million to $60 million, primarily to support the rebannering initiative.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a retailer, "R&D" is best measured by the testing and implementation of new concepts and technologies. Shoe Carnival has proven highly effective in this regard. The most salient example is the 10-store in-market test of the Shoe Station rebanner concept in Fiscal 2024. Management clearly stated that the "customer response and business results exceeded our success criteria," with sales and profits rising over 10% compared to the previous format. This successful, data-driven pilot program provided the validation needed to invest in a national rollout. This demonstrates a disciplined and effective approach to testing and validating new growth strategies before committing significant capital.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales and marketing efforts are distinguished by a highly effective customer loyalty program, "Shoe Perks." This program grew by 7% in Fiscal 2024 to 36.8 million members, a substantial number for a retailer of its size. Crucially, these members accounted for approximately 73% of the company's comparable stores net sales in Fiscal 2024, demonstrating deep customer engagement. The program allows for sophisticated, data-driven marketing and personalization, which underpins a "digital-first" marketing strategy. This combination of a large, high-value loyalty program and a modern marketing approach points to an above-average sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For Fiscal 2024, Shoe Carnival reported a gross margin of 35.6% and an operating margin of 7.6%. While its gross margin is lower than key competitor Caleres (Famous Footwear), which reported a 44.9% gross margin for its fiscal year 2024, Shoe Carnival's operating margin is substantially better (7.6% vs. 5.5% for Caleres). This demonstrates superior cost control and operational efficiency. The company has successfully maintained gross margins above 35% for four consecutive years, a significant improvement over pre-pandemic levels, indicating that its profit structure is both worthwhile and sustainable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQELs_MCGQLFSJ_YReKl81db719YU0Xo8escUFpuaSVos8IfjvP-3Fbt1UdK1RXgtXXtH5o4udupimm7-v6z2tK2kuvrUFuREjEerDpZ06f0gZwx2klhkOQIBNQbkwtgovdh9TA9T2Za1aikKYlnAa0gEKDtSehNF4aQ60oa4GLoq9d_Tg1f_4o9Io4kQZ4TRRhGxroZaguBMCFQsQKiaDYLiFW4VaLcldXbENJngOgHlWJTxqKtzc7gKh24g==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQELs_MCGQLFSJ_YReKl81db719YU0Xo8escUFpuaSVos8IfjvP-3Fbt1UdK1RXgtXXtH5o4udupimm7-v6z2tK2kuvrUFuREjEerDpZ06f0gZwx2klhkOQIBNQbkwtgovdh9TA9T2Za1aikKYlnAa0gEKDtSehNF4aQ60oa4GLoq9d_Tg1f_4o9Io4kQZ4TRRhGxroZaguBMCFQsQKiaDYLiFW4VaLcldXbENJngOgHlWJTxqKtzc7gKh24g==) (March 20, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively pursuing several initiatives to enhance profitability. The core action is the store rebannering program, which shifts the store base toward the higher-margin Shoe Station concept, with a target of increasing profit contribution by over 20% in converted stores. Management also focuses on disciplined "targeted promotional plans" and buying strategies, leveraging data from its loyalty program to avoid margin-eroding blanket discounts. Additionally, the company is controlling costs by optimizing advertising spend with a digital-first strategy and capturing synergies from acquisitions like Rogan's.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Evidence strongly suggests outstanding labor relations. The company's workforce is not represented by any labor unions. More impressively, retention and internal promotion rates are exceptionally high: nearly all general and district managers are promoted from within. As of Fiscal 2024 year-end, 68% of district managers have been with the company for over 20 years, and the average tenure for a general manager is 14 years. These figures indicate a high degree of employee satisfaction and loyalty in roles critical to operational success.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team reflects a healthy blend of long-term stability and planned succession. J. Wayne Weaver has been Chairman since 1988, providing consistent oversight. The Chief Operating Officer, Marc Chilton, is a 30-year veteran who rose from a store manager role. The recent retirement of the Chief Merchandising Officer was handled via a clear succession plan, with his replacement being a long-tenured internal candidate who was promoted. This stability, combined with methodical succession, points to a functional and stable executive environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s leadership team possesses significant and relevant experience. Beyond the CEO, the C-suite includes a COO with over 30 years of experience rising through the company's own ranks, providing deep institutional knowledge. The incoming Chief Merchandising Officer has over a decade of experience in various merchandising roles within Shoe Carnival. The CFO brings years of financial leadership experience from outside the company. This mix of deep internal knowledge and external expertise across key functions demonstrates strong management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's accounting controls appear to be robust. The independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's financial statements for the period ended February 1, 2025. Crucially, Deloitte also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. There is no history of material weaknesses or financial restatements mentioned. This external validation from a premier accounting firm is strong evidence of excellent controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Shoe Carnival possesses several key differentiators. The Shoe Carnival banner's high-energy, promotional in-store experience (featuring a "mic-person" and "spin-n-win wheel") is unique in the otherwise staid family footwear space. On a corporate level, the scale and effectiveness of its 36.8 million-member "Shoe Perks" loyalty program provides a significant data advantage for merchandising and marketing. Finally, its omnichannel strategy, which heavily utilizes a ship-from-store model to fulfill e-commerce orders, allows for better inventory productivity and selection compared to competitors with siloed channel inventories.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management clearly prioritizes long-range profitability, even at the expense of near-term results. The company explicitly guided in its Fiscal 2024 10-K that the initial phase of its rebanner strategy is forecasted to *decrease* Fiscal 2025 operating income by $20 to $25 million. This investment is expected to be recovered over a two-to-three-year period, with the ultimate goal of significantly higher sales and profit from the converted stores. Publicly committing to a significant short-term profit decline to fund a multi-year strategic initiative is a hallmark of a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, posing no foreseeable risk of equity dilution. As of February 1, 2025, the balance sheet was free of any debt, a condition maintained for 20 consecutive fiscal years. The company held $123.1 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. It generated $102.6 million in cash from operations in Fiscal 2024 and funded its $44.8 million acquisition of Rogan's with cash on hand. The existence of a $50 million share repurchase authorization further underscores that the company is a buyer, not a seller, of its own stock.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its financial reporting. In the Fiscal 2024 10-K, the company was transparent about its 3.9% comparable store sales decline, attributing it specifically to weakness in the Shoe Carnival banner during non-peak periods. Furthermore, management was upfront about the significant short-term costs of its long-term rebannering strategy, proactively guiding for a $20 to $25 million reduction in operating income for Fiscal 2025. This willingness to openly discuss negative trends and the costs of strategic investment, rather than obscuring them, is a clear sign of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's SEC filings reveals no red flags concerning management integrity. The 10-K reports no material legal proceedings outside the ordinary course of business. There are no disclosed regulatory investigations, related-party transactions of concern, or governance issues. The company receives a clean audit opinion on its financial statements and internal controls. While the founding family maintains significant ownership, this is transparently disclosed as a risk factor. In the absence of any contrary evidence, management's integrity appears to be unquestionable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/895447/000095017025043195/scvl-20250201.htm) (March 21, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Shoe Carnival scores perfectly across Fisher's 15 points, painting a picture of a well-managed, financially robust, and strategically focused retailer. The strongest positives are its pristine debt-free balance sheet, outstanding personnel relations evidenced by remarkable employee tenure, and a clear, data-driven long-term strategy. Management’s willingness to sacrifice near-term profits for durable growth through its store rebannering program is a particularly strong positive signal. The primary variable that will determine the company’s trajectory over the next 12-24 months is the execution of this rebannering strategy. The key evidence to watch will be the quarterly sales and margin performance of the first 50-75 converted stores in Fiscal 2025. If these stores meet or exceed the targeted 10%+ sales lift and 20%+ profit improvement, it will validate the entire long-term growth thesis.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
