### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Network effects are non-existent in the death care industry. The value of a funeral home or cemetery does not increase for a customer as more customers use its services. The business is fundamentally a local, service-based operation with no user-to-user interaction that would create a network effect.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business description focuses entirely on providing funeral and cemetery services and merchandise, with no mention of network-based value propositions. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs are low for at-need services, as families can choose any provider. However, for pre-need arrangements, which represent a significant portion of the business, there are moderate switching costs related to transferring trust or insurance-funded plans, which can be logistically and emotionally difficult. The company has a significant backlog of these contracts, creating a degree of customer lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   At December 31, 2024, the company had a backlog of 102,799 preneed funeral contracts and 69,408 preneed cemetery contracts to be delivered in the future. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Preneed contracts are secured by placing funds in trusts or through life insurance policies, which creates a financial and administrative barrier to switching providers. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Carriage Services may benefit from minor scale advantages in purchasing merchandise like caskets and urns compared to small independent operators. However, the business has high fixed costs (facilities, maintenance) and is predominantly a service business driven by local labor costs, limiting the potential for significant, durable cost advantages over other large competitors like Service Corporation International.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as a high fixed-cost business, where costs for facilities, salaries, and maintenance are incurred regardless of sales volume, which can negatively impact margins during periods of sales decline. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Gross profit was 35.5% of revenue in FY 2024, indicating a substantial cost of service and merchandise relative to sales. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** The primary intangible asset in this industry is the local reputation and heritage of individual funeral homes and cemeteries, which can be a strong driver of market share. Carriage's strategy involves acquiring businesses with established local brands. However, these brands are localized and do not represent a national brand premium, and there is no significant patent or intellectual property protection.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's strategy includes a focus on "Enhanced local brands" to strengthen customer connections and loyalty by tailoring services to each community's unique character and needs. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The company states that market share is largely a function of reputation and heritage. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company carried USD 414.9 million of goodwill, reflecting the value of intangible assets like reputation acquired in business combinations. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** This is a key advantage. The death care industry is characterized by efficient scale in local markets; a given geography can only profitably support a limited number of funeral homes and cemeteries. By owning well-located, established facilities, Carriage creates a significant barrier to entry, as building a new funeral home or cemetery is capital-intensive and often faces zoning challenges.
**Evidence:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, Carriage operated a dense network of 159 funeral homes and 28 cemeteries across 25 states. (Form 10-Q, Aug 1, 2025)
*   The company states it is a "market leader in most of our markets." (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The high fixed costs of facilities demonstrate that a certain level of local market share is required to operate profitably, making it difficult for new entrants to compete against an established player. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** The company possesses customer data, but there is no evidence that this data is unique, hard to replicate, or used to create a feedback loop that improves the service and locks in customers. The nature of the death care industry limits the applicability of data-driven advantages seen in technology or retail sectors. The "Trinity" digital transformation project appears focused on internal efficiency rather than a data moat.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's "Trinity" digital transformation project is described as streamlining processes to put customers at the forefront, suggesting an efficiency and service focus, not a data-based competitive advantage. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Carriage Services operates a traditional, direct-to-consumer service model. It is not a platform business and does not foster a third-party ecosystem of developers or complementary service providers that would enhance its value proposition.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's business description focuses on the direct provision of funeral and cemetery services and merchandise, with no indication of a platform or ecosystem strategy. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The industry is subject to significant state and federal regulation, creating a barrier to entry. State laws impose stringent licensing requirements for funeral directors, embalmers, and establishments. Furthermore, extensive regulations govern preneed sales and the administration of trust funds, adding complexity and compliance costs for new entrants.
**Evidence:**
*   Operations are subject to supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state, and local laws, including extensive regulations concerning trust funds and preneed sales. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   The funeral home operations are comprehensively regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) under the "Funeral Rule." (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The assets required to compete—specifically funeral homes and cemeteries—are highly capital-intensive and asset-specific. These are specialized real estate assets that cannot be easily repurposed, creating a high barrier to entry and exit. This deters new competition, as entrants must commit significant sunk costs to build or acquire suitable properties.
**Evidence:**
*   As of June 30, 2025, the company reported USD 271.4 million in net property, plant, and equipment and USD 110.6 million in net cemetery property. (Form 10-Q, Aug 1, 2025)
*   Capital expenditures for the six months ended June 30, 2025, were USD 6.0 million, demonstrating the ongoing need for investment in physical assets. (Form 10-Q, Aug 1, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** The company has a degree of revenue visibility from its substantial backlog of preneed funeral and cemetery contracts. While the timing of revenue recognition is uncertain (dependent on mortality), this backlog represents a future stream of committed customer revenue.
**Evidence:**
*   At December 31, 2024, the company had a backlog of 102,799 preneed funeral contracts and 69,408 preneed cemetery contracts. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
*   Approximately 15% of funeral services performed and 69% of cemetery revenue in 2024 originated from preneed contracts, demonstrating their importance to the revenue model. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **Aggregation**
**Weighted Sum Calculation:**
(18% * 0) + (15% * 2) + (15% * 2) + (12% * 3) + (10% * 4) + (10% * 0) + (8% * 0) + (6% * 3) + (4% * 4) + (2% * 3)
= 0 + 0.30 + 0.30 + 0.36 + 0.40 + 0 + 0 + 0.18 + 0.16 + 0.06
= 1.76

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 17.6 / 100

### **Mapping**
The weighted score of 17.6 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 threshold.
**Final Moat Rating:** 1 / 5.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is approximately 5–7 years. The company's primary advantages stem from efficient scale in local markets and the capital intensity of its assets, which are durable but not insurmountable barriers. Competitive pressures from low-cost cremation providers and the slow erosion of local brand loyalty over time are likely to constrain the moat's durability beyond this timeframe.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Accelerated Shift to Cremation:** A faster-than-anticipated consumer shift towards low-cost, direct cremation services could erode the value of Carriage's traditional funeral home assets and reduce the average revenue per service.
2.  **Increased Competition:** Aggressive price competition from independent operators or other large consolidators could force price reductions, compressing margins and eroding the profitability of established local businesses.
3.  **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in state or federal laws, particularly those making preneed contract cancellation and fund transfers easier for consumers, could weaken the moderate switching costs that currently exist.

### **KPIs to Monitor**
1.  **Cremation Rate:** An accelerating rate (currently 60.2%) indicates a shift away from higher-revenue traditional burials. (Form 10-K, Feb 28, 2025)
2.  **Average Revenue Per Funeral Contract:** A declining trend would signal pricing pressure or a mix-shift to lower-value services.
3.  **Preneed Cemetery Sales Volume:** A slowdown in the growth of preneed property sales would signal weakening demand or salesforce effectiveness.
4.  **Adjusted Consolidated EBITDA Margin:** A decline from the current level (30.8% in Q1 2025) would indicate eroding profitability. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call Summary)
5.  **Leverage Ratio:** An increase in the leverage ratio (4.2x as of Q2 2025) could indicate deteriorating cash flow or an inability to service debt. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript)
6.  **Acquisition Pipeline & Multiples:** A decrease in acquisition activity or an increase in purchase price multiples could signal a more competitive M&A environment.
7.  **Backlog Size (Preneed Contracts):** A decline in the total number of outstanding preneed contracts would reduce future revenue visibility.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Carriage Services, Inc. possesses a narrow economic moat, primarily derived from efficient scale in local markets and the high capital intensity of its specialized assets. These factors create effective, though not insurmountable, barriers to entry for new competitors. The company's strength is rooted in its portfolio of locally established funeral homes and cemeteries, which command a degree of market power. However, this moat is constrained by limited switching costs for at-need services, non-existent network effects, and the persistent industry trend toward lower-revenue cremations. An increase in the preneed backlog coupled with sustained margin expansion would be required to justify a higher rating; conversely, accelerated market share loss to low-cost providers would challenge the current rating.
