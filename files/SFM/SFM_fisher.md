Sprouts Farmers Market, Inc. (SFM), August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024; Proxy Statement filed April 8, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sprouts Farmers Market operates in the growing specialty, natural, and organic food sector. The company's growth strategy focuses on expanding its store base by approximately 10% annually, targeting locations where its key demographics of "health enthusiasts" and "selective shoppers" reside. This strategy is supported by a smaller, more efficient store format that is expected to deliver stronger returns. In fiscal 2024, the company opened 33 new stores and plans to open at least 35 more in fiscal 2025, demonstrating a clear path for continued sales growth through market expansion. The overall consumer trend towards healthier eating provides a favorable long-term tailwind for SFM's curated product assortment.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a strong commitment to ongoing development through aggressive product innovation and supply chain enhancement. In 2024, the company launched approximately 7,100 new products, utilizing a dedicated "foraging team" to source unique items that create a "treasure hunt" shopping experience. The company is also expanding its private-label "Sprouts Brand," which accounted for over 23% of revenue in fiscal 2024. Furthermore, SFM is strategically investing in its supply chain, aiming to have fresh distribution centers within a 250-mile radius of its stores to enhance freshness and efficiency; as of December 29, 2024, approximately 80% of stores met this goal.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a retailer, R&D is analogous to private-label product development and process innovation. Sprouts' effectiveness is demonstrated by the significant contribution of its "Sprouts Brand" products, which generated over 23% of total revenue in fiscal 2024. This indicates strong customer acceptance and a successful development pipeline. The company has a dedicated team focused on this program and is in the process of a complete packaging redesign to enhance brand recognition and sales, which is over 90% complete. The continuous introduction of new products (7,100 in 2024) further showcases an effective development process relative to its position in the specialty grocery industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SFM's sales performance indicates an effective sales and marketing apparatus. The company achieved a comparable store sales growth of 7.6% in fiscal 2024, a significant metric in retail. Its "digital-first" marketing strategy is focused on connecting with high-value customers, resulting in an 8.6% increase in email subscribers in 2024. The company is also leveraging its website and app for online ordering and is piloting a "Sprouts Rewards" loyalty program to further drive customer engagement and repeat business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sprouts reported a gross margin of 38.1% and an operating margin of approximately 6.5% for fiscal year 2024 (calculated as $504.5 million in operating income divided by $7.72 billion in net sales). The gross margin saw a notable improvement from 36.9% in the prior year. These margins are competitive within the grocery industry, which is known for its narrow margins. The company has demonstrated its ability to maintain and grow profitability in a competitive environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing several strategies to improve margins. A key initiative is the shift to a smaller store format (21,000-25,000 sq. ft.), which is less expensive to build and operate. The company is also enhancing its supply chain to improve efficiency and freshness, which helps reduce spoilage (shrink) and distribution costs. Furthermore, SFM leverages data analytics for "promotional optimization," aiming to drive profitable growth rather than just sales volume. The 1.2 percentage point increase in gross margin in fiscal 2024, attributed to favorable shrink and promotional strategies, confirms the effectiveness of these actions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K provides significant evidence of positive labor relations. None of its approximately 35,000 team members are subject to collective bargaining agreements, and the company states it has never experienced a strike or significant work stoppage. Management emphasizes its culture, highlighting that in 2024 it promoted over 6,100 team members and filled 54% of store manager positions with internal candidates. The company also offers comprehensive benefits, training programs (over 1 million hours in 2024), and various team member resource groups.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team and board of directors demonstrate stability. According to the 2025 Proxy Statement, Jack L. Sinclair has served as CEO since 2019, and the company's named executive officers have tenures with the company that indicate a stable leadership environment. The board is composed of individuals with extensive experience in retail, consumer goods, and finance. There is no evidence of significant executive turnover or public disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000222/sfm-20250629.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000222/sfm-20250629.htm) (April 8, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership team, as detailed in its 2025 Proxy Statement, extends beyond the CEO to include experienced executives in key roles such as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Operating Officer, Chief Marketing Officer, and Chief Legal Officer. The company highlights its focus on leadership development, noting it filled 54% of store manager positions with internal candidates in 2024, suggesting a pipeline of talent development from within the organization. The company also describes development programs like the McKinsey Connected Leaders Academy and a college fast-track program for management roles.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SFM's financial reporting appears robust and transparent. The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024. The 10-K provides detailed breakdowns of costs and performance metrics. There is no history of significant restatements or identified material weaknesses in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key differentiator for Sprouts is its unique store layout and product strategy. The "flipped" model with produce at the center of the store reinforces its "farmers market" heritage and focus on freshness. The company's emphasis on a curated selection of attribute-driven products (e.g., organic, plant-based, gluten-free) and a constant influx of new items creates a "treasure hunt" experience that differentiates it from conventional grocers. Additionally, the strategic shift to a smaller, more efficient store footprint allows for greater flexibility in site selection and potentially higher returns on invested capital than larger-format competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary and strategic initiatives clearly prioritize long-term, durable growth. The 10-K outlines a multi-faceted, long-term growth strategy focused on market expansion (10% annual unit growth), supply chain optimization, and customer engagement. Investments in new, smaller-format stores and distribution centers require significant upfront capital and may not be immediately accretive to earnings but are foundational for sustained future profitability. This consistent reinvestment in the business, rather than maximizing short-term profits, demonstrates a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, mitigating the risk of equity dilution. As of December 29, 2024, the company had no long-term debt outstanding. It generates robust operating cash flow, which reached $645.2 million in fiscal 2024. Instead of issuing shares, management is actively returning capital to shareholders through a significant share repurchase program, buying back $240.6 million worth of stock in fiscal 2024. This demonstrates that the company can comfortably fund its growth through internally generated cash.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1575515/000157551525000011/sfm-20241229.htm) (February 20, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Based on a review of recent earnings call transcripts, management appears to communicate with investors in a candid and transparent manner. In the Q1 2025 earnings call on April 30, 2025, executives provided detailed commentary on performance, strategic progress, and the outlook, while directly addressing analyst questions on topics like inflation, consumer behavior, and competitive pressures. The company provides specific financial guidance and discusses both achievements and challenges openly.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags to suggest a lack of integrity in management. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K states that while the company is party to various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business, these have not resulted in any material losses to date. A review of the 2025 Proxy Statement reveals no questionable related-party transactions, governance issues, or executive compensation practices that would indicate a breach of integrity. The company has a Code of Ethics for its senior financial officers and has not reported any waivers.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**
Sprouts Farmers Market scores perfectly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting a well-managed company with a clear, effective long-term strategy. The strongest positives are its robust financial health—marked by zero long-term debt, strong cash flow, and an aggressive share buyback program—and its successful execution of a differentiated retail strategy. The company's focus on a smaller store format, a unique product assortment, and an efficient supply chain is delivering impressive comparable store sales growth and margin improvement. The primary variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months would be a significant downturn in consumer spending on premium and organic products due to a recession, or increased competitive pressure from larger conventional grocers who continue to expand their own natural food offerings. Additionally, a failure to maintain momentum in new store openings at their targeted 10% annual growth rate would negatively impact the long-runway assessment.

fisher score is 15 / 15
