### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competition:** The fast-casual restaurant industry is highly competitive, and Chipotle faces pressure from both established players and new entrants.
2.  **Food Safety:** Any foodborne illness outbreak could significantly damage the company's brand and financial performance.
3.  **Input Costs:** Volatility in food and labor costs could pressure margins if the company is unable to pass on price increases to customers.
4.  **Consumer Spending:** A downturn in the economy could lead to reduced consumer spending on dining out, impacting Chipotle's sales.
5.  **Execution Risk:** The company's growth plans depend on its ability to successfully open and operate new restaurants.

final answer is 13.49 $
