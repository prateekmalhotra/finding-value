Company: Commercial Metals Company (CMC)
Date of Analysis: August 23, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for fiscal year ended August 31, 2024; Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (June 23, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC's core products, such as rebar and merchant bar, are essential for construction and infrastructure projects. Demand is supported by long-term structural trends, including U.S. infrastructure renewal funded by multi-year government programs. The company's downstream products backlog, a measure of future revenue, was a strong $1.6 billion as of August 31, 2024. Additionally, CMC is expanding into high-growth, value-added solutions within its Emerging Businesses Group, such as ground stabilization and performance reinforcing steels, to capture a larger share of the construction value chain.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC demonstrates a strong commitment to development through significant capital investment in advanced manufacturing. The company recently commissioned its third micro mill in Arizona, the first of its kind to produce merchant bar via a continuous process, and is constructing a fourth in West Virginia, expected to be operational in late 2025. The company is also expanding its portfolio of value-added offerings, including proprietary products like ChromX® high-strength rebar and acquiring technologies like the Tensar® geogrids to enter adjacent construction markets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company does not disclose specific Research & Development expenditure, making a direct comparison to peers on a percentage-of-revenue basis impossible. While the "Emerging Businesses Group" segment focuses on innovative and value-added products like performance reinforcing steels and ground stabilization solutions, the financial impact and effectiveness of the underlying R&D are not quantified in public filings. Without transparent metrics on R&D spending or output (e.g., patents, new product revenue), effectiveness cannot be verified.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC's filings mention a focus on "industry-leading customer service" and leveraging its vertically integrated model to serve customers effectively. However, there is no verifiable, quantitative data provided in public disclosures—such as customer retention rates, market share gains, or sales productivity metrics—to substantively prove that its sales organization is "above-average" compared to competitors. The claims are qualitative and not supported by concrete evidence.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024, CMC reported a gross profit margin of approximately 17.1% and a pre-tax profit margin of 8.0%. The company's net profit margin for the fiscal year was 6.1%. While margins compressed from the cyclical peaks of prior years, they remain positive in a competitive environment. One source noted that in Q2 2025, CMC achieved a net margin of 4.12%, which was higher than its competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC is actively working to improve margins by investing in higher efficiency, lower-cost production assets like its new micro mills, which incorporate the latest energy-efficient technologies. The company's vertical integration, from scrap recycling to fabrication, provides a structural advantage in managing input costs. Furthermore, the strategic focus on growing the Emerging Businesses Group aims to shift the product mix toward higher-margin, value-added solutions and away from purely cyclical commodity products.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC reports a strong commitment to safety, a key indicator in heavy industry. For fiscal 2024, the company achieved its lowest-ever Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR), which is significantly below the industry average published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. While portions of the workforce are unionized (14% in North America Steel Group), the company states that it believes it has "good relations with the union representatives." There is no evidence of recent, significant labor disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated stability and a structured approach to leadership. The recent CEO transition in September 2023 was explicitly described as the result of a "formal succession planning process," with the former CEO remaining as Executive Chairman for a one-year transition period, indicating a smooth and well-managed handover. The executive team includes several long-tenured officers who have been promoted from within the company, suggesting a stable and cohesive leadership environment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC's public disclosures name a team of six executive officers beyond the CEO, with clear responsibilities for key operating segments (North America Steel Group), strategy (Chief Strategy Officer), and core functions (CFO, Legal, HR). The biographies show a pattern of promoting from within, such as the heads of North America Steel, Legal, and HR, which indicates a developed pipeline of internal talent and leadership bench strength. The recent creation and hiring of a Chief Strategy Officer further adds to the management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2024. The 10-K includes detailed segment reporting with key operational metrics, indicating robust internal systems for tracking costs and performance. There is no evidence of material weaknesses or recent financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC's primary competitive advantages are structural and specific to the steel industry. Its vertically integrated model—from scrap collection to steelmaking to fabrication—provides significant cost control and supply security. The company exclusively uses Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) technology, which is more energy-efficient, has a lower carbon footprint, and is more flexible than traditional blast furnaces that rely on iron ore and coal. This positions CMC favorably from both a cost and sustainability perspective.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is prioritizing long-term growth through significant capital investments that require substantial near-term cash outlay for future benefit. The company's capital expenditure guidance for fiscal 2025 is $630 million to $680 million, largely for the construction of its fourth micro mill in West Virginia. This willingness to invest heavily in next-generation manufacturing technology, which will not contribute to earnings for several quarters, demonstrates a clear focus on long-range profitability and competitive positioning over maximizing short-term earnings per share.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CMC has a strong balance sheet and generates robust cash flow from operations ($899.7 million in fiscal 2024). The company actively returns capital to shareholders, having repurchased $182.9 million of its common stock in fiscal 2024 under a board-authorized program. As of August 31, 2024, the company had cash and cash equivalents of $857.9 million and a manageable debt-to-capitalization ratio, indicating ample capacity to fund its capital expenditure plans through cash on hand, operating cash flow, and existing credit facilities without needing to issue equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Review of the Q3 2025 earnings call transcript shows management openly discussing challenges. They addressed the difficult market conditions in Europe, attributing lower volumes and margins to "sluggish demand and heightened levels of imports." They also acknowledged softness in certain U.S. non-residential construction sectors. This willingness to detail specific headwinds and provide context, rather than relying on generalities, demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is currently defending itself in two antitrust lawsuits filed by Pacific Steel Group, which alleges anticompetitive behavior related to an equipment agreement and bidding practices. While CMC states it "believes that it has substantial defenses and intends to vigorously defend against PSG's claims," the existence of multiple, ongoing antitrust lawsuits raises questions that prevent a clear "Yes" under the "unquestionable" integrity standard. The outcome of this litigation is a material uncertainty related to management's conduct.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/22444/000002244424000140/cmc-20240831.htm) (Filed October 17, 2024)

Synthesis:
Commercial Metals Company scores well on many of Fisher's points, revealing a business with strong structural advantages, a long-term strategic focus, and a healthy financial position. Key strengths include its cost-advantaged, vertically integrated EAF manufacturing process, a clear commitment to reinvesting in next-generation assets for future growth, and a stable, experienced management team with robust accounting controls. The company's focus on safety and a strong balance sheet that supports share buybacks over dilutive financing are also significant positives. The primary weaknesses identified relate to a lack of transparency in specific metrics for R&D and sales force effectiveness, and, most notably, ongoing antitrust litigation that casts a shadow over the "unquestionable integrity" criterion.

The Fisher score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables. First, the resolution of the Pacific Steel Group antitrust lawsuits would be critical; a favorable outcome for CMC could flip point 15 from "No" to "Yes." Second, as the new micro mills in Arizona and West Virginia ramp up production, clearer evidence of their promised efficiency gains and impact on profit margins will emerge, potentially strengthening the "Margin Improvement" case. To change the "No" votes on R&D and sales, CMC would need to begin disclosing specific metrics, such as R&D as a percentage of sales or data on market share trends, that would allow for a verifiable, quantitative assessment of their effectiveness.

fisher score is 12 / 15
