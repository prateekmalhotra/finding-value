Of course. Here is a revised and corrected version of the valuation analysis. I have identified several key areas for improvement, primarily concerning the terminal value assumption and the discount rate, which together led to an overly conservative initial valuation.

The following analysis retains the original structure and information while adjusting the critical assumptions to be more aligned with a balanced, realistic view of the company's future prospects.

### **PART 1: MARKET-IMPLIED VALUATION (REVERSE DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability expectations embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1) **Current Market Price:** $85.34 (as of August 22, 2025). This price is the basis for the market's current valuation.

2) **Baseline Financials (TTM - Trailing Twelve Months ending May 2, 2025):**
The TTM financials are constructed by taking the audited figures from the last fiscal year (ended Oct 31, 2024), adding the first two quarters of the current fiscal year (ended Jan 31, 2025, and May 2, 2025), and subtracting the first two quarters of the prior fiscal year.

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,461.5 | Inferred from 10-K and 10-Q filings. |
| Gross Margin | 34.1% | Inferred from 10-K and 10-Q filings. |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $468.9 | Inferred from 10-K and 10-Q filings. |
| Net Income | $345.1 | Inferred from 10-K and 10-Q filings. |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $125.0 | Inferred from cash flow statements. |
| Stock-Based Comp. | $39.8 | Inferred from cash flow statements. |
| Capital Expenditures | ($145.2) | Inferred from cash flow statements. |
| Change in Working Capital | ($55.0) | Inferred from cash flow statements. |
| Interest Expense | $70.1 | Inferred from income statements. |
| Cash & Equivalents | $215.7 | As of May 2, 2025. |
| Total Debt | $1,734.9 | As of May 2, 2025 (Short-term + Long-term debt). |
| Diluted Shares | 102.1 | As of May 2, 2025. |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions embedded in the stock price, we solve for the revenue growth and operating margin that justify the current Enterprise Value of approximately $10,234 million (Market Cap of $8,713M + Net Debt of $1,519M).

*   **Market-Implied Assumptions:** Holding the TTM operating margin of 10.5% constant, the market price of $85.34 can be justified with a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 7.5%**, followed by a 2.5% terminal growth rate. This is a significant growth expectation for a mature industrial company.

This analysis answers the question: *"What does one have to believe to justify today's stock price?"* An investor must believe The Toro Company can sustainably grow its revenue at 7.5% per year for the next five years while maintaining its current profitability, a rate notably higher than its recent historical average.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (BALANCED BASE-CASE)**

This section builds a valuation from the ground up using balanced, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6) **Rationale:** My assumptions differ from the market's implied view but are less conservative than the original analysis. The market's 7.5% growth appears optimistic, while the original 4.0% growth was arguably too pessimistic. This revised base case assumes moderate growth slightly below its pre-pandemic average, reflecting both its market leadership and potential macroeconomic headwinds.

7) **Revenue for Years 1â€“5:** I will use a 5-year revenue CAGR of **4.5%**, tapering from 5.5% in Year 1 down to 4.0% in Year 5. This is a more balanced forecast, acknowledging the company's ability to capture price and volume growth while factoring in cyclical realities.

8) **Margin Path:** I will assume a stable **EBIT margin of 10.5%** for the entire forecast period. This remains a sound assumption, reflecting historical performance and the absence of clear catalysts for significant, sustained margin expansion or contraction.

9) **Taxes:** The **21.0% effective tax rate** is a reasonable long-term assumption based on historical data.

10) **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Projecting **capex at 3.3% of annual revenue** remains a solid, data-driven assumption based on the company's historical reinvestment rate.
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeling the change in non-cash working capital at **12.0% of incremental revenue** remains consistent with historical patterns.

11) **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) will be modeled at **0.9% of revenue** and treated as a real cash expense.
    *   A net **0.75% annual reduction in shares outstanding** is a reasonable assumption based on the company's stated capital allocation policy of returning cash to shareholders via buybacks, net of dilution.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12) Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated as:
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital - SBC`

13) FCFF is used because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity), making it ideal for an enterprise-level valuation.

| (in millions USD) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $4,706.9 | $4,917.7 | $5,138.1 | $5,356.5 | $5,570.8 |
| EBIT (10.5%) | $494.2 | $516.4 | $539.5 | $562.4 | $584.9 |
| NOPAT | $390.4 | $407.9 | $426.2 | $444.3 | $462.1 |
| D&A | $130.0 | $135.2 | $140.6 | $146.2 | $152.0 |
| Stock-Based Comp | ($42.4) | ($44.3) | ($46.2) | ($48.2) | ($50.1) |
| Capex | ($155.3) | ($162.3) | ($169.6) | ($176.8) | ($183.8) |
| Change in WC | ($29.5) | ($25.3) | ($26.4) | ($26.2) | ($25.7) |
| **FCFF** | **$293.2** | **$311.2** | **$324.6** | **$339.3** | **$354.5** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14) **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury yield as of August 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. A standard premium for a mature U.S. company.
    *   **Beta:** **1.05**. The original Beta of 1.15 was slightly aggressive. A beta of 1.05 better reflects TTC's position as a market leader with a mix of cyclical and non-cyclical revenue streams, making it slightly less volatile than the broader market average for cyclicals.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.05 * 5.0% = 9.50%*

15) **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense (TTM) / Total Debt = $70.1M / $1,734.9M = 4.04%.
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 4.04% * (1 - 21.0%) = 3.19%.

16) **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (E) = $8,713M
    *   Market Value of Debt (D) = $1,735M
    *   Total Value (V) = $10,448M
    *   *WACC = (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd) = (83.4% * 9.50%) + (16.6% * 3.19%) = 8.48%*

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17) **Methodology Correction:** The original analysis correctly identified that the Gordon Growth Method (GGM) produced an implied EV/EBITDA multiple (7.8x) that was unrealistically low for a high-quality, market-leading company like Toro, which has historically traded at a median of ~12.0x. This indicates a mismatch between the GGM's inputs and market reality. The Exit Multiple method is more appropriate here as it grounds the terminal valuation in real-world trading multiples.

18) **Exit Multiple Selection and Calculation:**
    *   **a.** Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $584.9M + $152.0M = $736.9M.
    *   **b.** The 10-year median EV/EBITDA multiple for TTC is approximately 12.0x. Using a multiple far below this, such as 10.5x, is still overly conservative and implies a permanent de-rating of the company's value.
    *   **c.** A more balanced approach is to use a multiple that is a slight discount to the historical median, acknowledging future uncertainty without being punitive. I will use an **11.5x EV/EBITDA exit multiple**. This reflects a mature, stable company that continues to command a premium for its market leadership and brand strength.
    *   *Revised Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $736.9M * 11.5 = $8,474 million*

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19) **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of 5-Year FCFF = $293.2/(1.0848)^1 + ... + $354.5/(1.0848)^5 = $1,257M
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $8,474M / (1.0848)^5 = $5,648M
    *   *Enterprise Value = $1,257M + $5,648M = $6,905 million*

20) **Equity Value:**
    *   *Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt*
    *   Equity Value = $6,905M - ($1,734.9M Debt - $215.7M Cash) = **$5,386 million**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21) **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Current Diluted Shares: 102.1M.
    *   Projected Year 5 Shares (with 0.75% annual reduction) = 102.1M * (1 - 0.0075)^5 = 98.3M.
    *   ***Base-Case Fair Value = $5,386M / 98.3M shares = $54.79***

22) **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $54.79.** Assumes 4.5% CAGR revenue growth, 10.5% EBIT margin, and an 11.5x exit multiple.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $42.00.** Assumes 2.5% revenue growth and 9.5% margin compression due to a recession, with the exit multiple contracting to 10.0x.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $71.00.** Assumes 6.0% revenue growth from successful new products, modest margin expansion to 11.0%, and a return to the historical median 12.0x exit multiple.

23) **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety is applied to the balanced base-case estimate to account for forecast uncertainty and unforeseen risks.
    *   ***MOS Price = $54.79 * (1 - 0.30) = $38.35***

**Risk Notes**
1.  **Economic Cyclicality:** A significant portion of TTC's revenue is tied to landscaping, construction, and agricultural markets, which are sensitive to economic downturns and interest rate fluctuations.
2.  **Weather Dependency:** Unfavorable weather conditions (e.g., drought, mild winters) can significantly impact demand for products like irrigation systems and snow blowers.
3.  **Competitive Pressure:** The professional and residential equipment markets are highly competitive. Failure to innovate or compete on price could lead to market share loss and margin erosion.
4.  **Input Cost Volatility:** Fluctuations in the cost of raw materials like steel and components can impact gross margins if costs cannot be passed on to customers in a timely manner.
5.  **Supply Chain Disruption:** Like many manufacturers, TTC is exposed to risks from global supply chain disruptions that can affect production and inventory levels.

final answer is 54.79 $
