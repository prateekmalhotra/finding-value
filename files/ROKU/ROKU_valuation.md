### B) Management Guidance Extraction

Verbatim extracts from the Q2 2025 earnings call on July 31, 2025:

*   **Revenue Growth:** Management has confidence to "sustain double-digit Platform revenue growth, while also improving profitability in 2026 and beyond." In Q2, Platform revenue grew 18% year-over-year.
*   **Profitability:** The company is "on track to be operating income positive in Q4 of this year and for full year 2026."
*   **Margins:** Management expects "further margin improvement in 2026" and for the "2026 OpEx growth rate and Platform margins to stay relatively in line with 2025."

### C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)

| Assumption | Year 1-5 Detail & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth** | **Y1: 15.0%, Y2: 13.0%, Y3: 11.0%, Y4: 9.0%, Y5: 7.0%.** Starts at a reasonable rate below the recent 18% platform growth but above the "double-digit" minimum guidance, tapering toward a more mature growth rate. |
| **Operating Margin** | **Y1: 0.5%, Y2: 1.5%, Y3: 2.5%, Y4: 3.5%, Y5: 4.5%.** Path reflects management's direct guidance to achieve operating profitability in FY 2026 (Year 1 of the forecast) and assumes modest, continued margin expansion from operating leverage. |
| **Tax Rate** | **0% on FCFF, 21% for WACC/TV.** A 0% cash tax rate is assumed during the 5-year forecast due to significant historical net operating losses (NOLs) likely shielding any income. A normalized U.S. statutory rate of 21% is used for long-term calculations. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **7.0%.** Based on the TTM D&A ($321M) / TTM Revenue ($4,395M) of 7.3%, rounded for conservatism. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **8.5%.** Based on the TTM SBC ($382M) / TTM Revenue ($4,395M) of 8.7%, rounded for conservatism. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue**| **0.5%.** Based on the TTM Capex ($6.6M) / TTM Revenue ($4,395M) of 0.15%, increased slightly to be more conservative. |
| **Change in WC as % of Inc. Revenue** | **-5.0%.** Historical change in working capital has been volatile and often negative (a source of cash). A slightly negative rate is assumed to continue. |

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers. The formula is:
**FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (USD, Millions) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,054 | $5,711 | $6,339 | $6,910 | $7,394 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *15.0%* | *13.0%* | *11.0%* | *9.0%* | *7.0%* |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM) = R(f) + Beta * ERP**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate (Rf):** **4.28%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%** (Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.)
    *   **Beta (Î²):** **2.05** (Yahoo Finance, 5-Year Monthly). This reflects higher-than-market volatility, appropriate for a high-growth tech company in a competitive streaming landscape.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.28% + 2.05 * 5.0% = 14.53%**

*   **Cost of Debt**
    *   **Cost of Debt (Rd):** **0.2%** (Inferred from TTM Interest Expense ($1.3M) / Total Debt ($567M))
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 0.2% * (1 - 0.21) = 0.16%**

*   **WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Ke + (D / (E+D)) * Kd * (1-T)**
    *   **Market Value of Equity (E):** **$13,303M** (Market Cap from Yahoo Finance, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** **$567M**
    *   **WACC = (13303 / 13870) * 14.53% + (567 / 13870) * 0.16% = 13.93% + 0.01% = 13.94%**

### F) Terminal Value

*   **Gordon Growth Method**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** **2.5%**. A reasonable long-term estimate, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   **Terminal Value = ($209.0 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1394 - 0.025) = $214.2 / 0.1144 = $1,872.9M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**
    *   **EBITDA Year 5 = EBIT + D&A = $332.7M + $517.5M = $850.2M**
    *   **Assumed Exit Multiple (EV/EBITDA):** **15.0x**. A reasonable multiple for a profitable, medium-growth media technology company.
    *   **Terminal Value = $850.2M * 15.0 = $12,753M**
    *   **Judgement:** There is a significant discrepancy. The Gordon Growth method yields a much lower value, likely due to the high WACC and modest Year 5 FCFF. As per instructions, the lower, more conservative value will be used.
    *   **Selected Terminal Value = $1,872.9M**

***

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

*   **Enterprise Value = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = (-42.8 / 1.1394^1) + (3.2 / 1.1394^2) + (63.2 / 1.1394^3) + (132.4 / 1.1394^4) + (209.0 / 1.1394^5)
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = -$37.6 + $2.5 + $42.5 + $78.0 + $108.6 = **$194.0M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $1,872.9 / (1.1394^5) = **$973.1M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $194.0M + $973.1M = $1,167.1M**

*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   **Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash = $567.2M - $2,253M = -$1,685.8M** (Net Cash) (StockAnalysis Balance Sheet, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   **Equity Value = $1,167.1M - (-$1,685.8M) = $2,852.9M**

***

### H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding**
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $2,852.9M / 146.0M = $19.54 per share**

*   **Valuation Range**
    *   **Base Case: $19.54**. Assumes successful execution on profitability guidance and moderate revenue growth.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: ~$10-15**. This scenario would result from lower revenue growth (e.g., high single digits) and failure to achieve positive operating margins, keeping FCFF negative.
    *   **High/Bull Case: ~$35-45**. This scenario assumes faster revenue growth (e.g., high teens) and quicker, more significant margin expansion (e.g., to high single digits), along with a higher terminal value multiple.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**
    *   **MOS Discount:** 30%
    *   **MOS Price = $19.54 * (1 - 0.30) = $13.68**

### One-Paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include: (1) **Competition:** The streaming market is intensely competitive, and pressure from larger players like Google, Amazon, and Apple could compress growth and margins. (2) **Advertising Market Sensitivity:** Roku's platform revenue is heavily reliant on the digital advertising market, which is cyclical and could soften in an economic downturn. (3) **Margin Execution:** The forecast is highly dependent on management's ability to transition the company from losses to sustained profitability, which is not guaranteed. (4) **High Beta:** The stock's high beta (2.05) implies significant volatility and sensitivity to market sentiment, which can lead to large price swings independent of fundamental performance.

final answer is 19.54 $
