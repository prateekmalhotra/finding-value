Company: California Water Service Group (CWT)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K filed February 27, 2025; Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript dated July 31, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** California Water Service Group provides essential water and wastewater utility services in western U.S. states. Growth is driven by the necessity of its service, population growth in its territories, and a stated strategy of acquiring smaller water systems. The company's 2024 10-K filing outlines its intent to "continue exploring opportunities to expand our regulated and non-regulated water and wastewater activities." Customer connections grew modestly from 556,400 at year-end 2023 to 560,100 at year-end 2024, demonstrating stable underlying growth. While not a high-growth industry, the combination of essential services and a clear acquisition strategy provides a long runway for steady, predictable sales increases.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a water utility, development is synonymous with capital investment in infrastructure to ensure safety, reliability, and regulatory compliance. In its 2024 General Rate Case (GRC) application, the company proposed investing over $1.6 billion from 2025 to 2027. These funds are targeted for replacing aging pipelines, upgrading water quality treatment to address new regulations for contaminants like PFAS, enhancing security, and investing in water supply reliability projects. This level of planned capital expenditure demonstrates a strong, ongoing commitment to maintaining and improving the core service and asset base, which is the primary driver of revenue growth in a regulated utility context.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's regulatory filings do not mention a formal Research and Development program or associated expenses, which is typical for a regulated water utility. Innovation is driven by regulatory requirements and operational needs, such as developing treatment solutions for emerging contaminants like PFAS and Chromium-6, rather than creating new products for competitive markets. While the company implements new technologies, such as Advanced Metering Infrastructure, these are considered capital expenditures for operational improvement, not R&D in the traditional sense.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a regulated utility, CWT's "sales" function consists of regulatory affairs and business development (acquisitions), not traditional customer sales. The company has a proven track record of successfully navigating complex triennial GRCs to secure rate increases that recover its costs and earn an authorized return on investment. The 2021 GRC, resolved in March 2024, authorized a retroactive revenue increase of approximately $41.5 million for 2023. Furthermore, the company's growth strategy is explicitly focused on acquisitions, such as its December 2024 purchase of a wastewater utility on Kauai, Hawaii. This demonstrates effectiveness in the specialized "sales" activities crucial to a utility.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ending December 31, 2024, CWT reported an operating margin of 21.7% and a net profit margin of 18.4%. These results were favorably impacted by a retroactive rate case decision. For comparison, a major peer, American Water Works, reported an operating margin of 29.0% and a net margin of 22.1% for 2024. While CWT's margins are lower than this key competitor, the regulated nature of the business provides for consistent and predictable returns on invested capital, making the margins worthwhile and stable.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHSUgh9BliqfEPLpjTlmArudSq4x_5HgZAZ3ag5-FRN5Ug0RyBUOC4dx3tn3w1y5mpJ_P94_WWp6FzCEXWsjdiMfo-keWNj2UxKjXbZjCH2nSje74BJph5T7H-oNIAFo1mmM5Mosh7nAtrWZP7XbxpzKG8UdI5dxsTL9rOGg2lusPkgzKJHrKRg47wA'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHSUgh9BliqfEPLpjTlmArudSq4x_5HgZAZ3ag5-FRN5Ug0RyBUOC4dx3tn3w1y5mpJ_P94_WWp6FzCEXWsjdiMfo-keWNj2UxKjXbZjCH2nSje74BJph5T7H-oNIAFo1mmM5Mosh7nAtrWZP7XbxpzKG8UdI5dxsTL9rOGg2lusPkgzKJHrKRg47wA), ['https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEf3dG60hC4fWVj0mq1a3Ncslc7VmD4zLfzm4usrnsXwrecqoe-BwkG3P6Egns2zCJbNPf8fDGFFbAI2OHrOhVm0YIQUIR9JWOgiKJkXdvfS3Sg29HwUXtQp1BYQgBpZ16XRZA1gNPDzhz9uLQ_e2a7a5y2_fSj3yLIvR20UEzl'](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEf3dG60hC4fWVj0mq1a3Ncslc7VmD4zLfzm4usrnsXwrecqoe-BwkG3P6Egns2zCJbNPf8fDGFFbAI2OHrOhVm0YIQUIR9JWOgiKJkXdvfS3Sg29HwUXtQp1BYQgBpZ16XRZA1gNPDzhz9uLQ_e2a7a5y2_fSj3yLIvR20UEzl)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CWT actively manages its margins primarily through the regulatory process. The company utilizes mechanisms like the Incremental Cost Balancing Account (ICBA) to recover variable production costs (purchased water, power) and the Monterey-Style Water Revenue Adjustment Mechanism (MWRAM) to stabilize revenues by decoupling them from sales volumes. The company’s primary long-term strategy for margin improvement is filing comprehensive GRCs to recover costs from its significant, ongoing capital investments in infrastructure. The latest 2024 GRC filing seeks rate increases for 2026, 2027, and 2028 to support its $1.6 billion investment plan.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states, "Management believes that the Company's employee relations are strong." As of December 31, 2024, approximately 60% of the workforce was unionized. In 2021, the company successfully negotiated separate six-year agreements with its two main unions, the Utility Workers Union of America (UWUA) and the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE). These contracts run through February 2027, ensuring long-term labor stability. The absence of recent labor strife combined with long-term contracts supports the assessment of outstanding relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team exhibits significant stability and long tenure, suggesting strong internal relations. The "Information About Our Executive Officers" table in the 2024 10-K lists numerous senior leaders who have been with the company for over a decade, many having been promoted from within. For instance, CEO Martin A. Kropelnicki joined in 2006 and held several roles before becoming CEO, while other senior vice presidents have service histories dating back to 1992 and 1999. This continuity at the highest levels points to a cohesive and stable management team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K details a broad and experienced leadership team beyond the CEO, with 14 named executive officers overseeing key functions like Operations, Finance, Customer Service, and Regulatory Affairs. The company explicitly states a commitment to leadership development through its "Future Leaders of Water Development Program" and a focus on promoting from within, which is evidenced by the career paths of its current executives. The average tenure of the management team is over 15 years, indicating a deep bench of experience and institutional knowledge.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm" included in the 2024 10-K provides an unqualified opinion from Deloitte & Touche LLP on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The auditors' report explicitly states that the company "maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting." There is no history of recent material restatements, and the detailed discussion of regulatory balancing accounts indicates granular cost tracking.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the regulated utility industry, key differentiators include regulatory management and water supply stewardship. CWT demonstrates outstanding capability in regulatory affairs, evidenced by its successful GRC outcomes and, notably, its leading role in a petition to the California Supreme Court that, on July 8, 2024, voided an unfavorable CPUC decision regarding revenue decoupling mechanisms. Proactive water supply management is shown through its diverse portfolio of water sources (wells, purchased, and surface water) and its detailed planning to comply with new environmental standards for PFAS and Chromium-6. This proficiency in the core competencies for its industry is a strong positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The business model of a capital-intensive utility is inherently long-range, requiring significant upfront investment with cost recovery over decades. CWT's strategy aligns with this, prioritizing massive infrastructure investments to ensure long-term service reliability over short-term earnings. The company's 2024 GRC application, which plans for $1.6 billion in capital projects from 2025 to 2027, is a clear testament to its long-range focus. Management's discussion in public filings consistently centers on these multi-year investment cycles and regulatory proceedings, not on meeting quarterly profit targets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CWT's business is capital-intensive and requires external financing. The company utilizes an at-the-market (ATM) equity program, selling 1.64 million shares for $86.5 million in net proceeds during 2024. This increased the share count by approximately 3.1% year-over-year. In August 2024, the CPUC granted the company authority to issue up to $1.3 billion in new equity and debt through 2027 to finance its infrastructure plan. While necessary for its regulated business model, this reliance on equity issuance to fund a significant portion of its capital needs leads to ongoing dilution for existing shareholders.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a high level of transparency in its communications. The 2024 10-K contains an extensive "Risk Factors" section detailing numerous challenges, from regulatory risks to the operational impacts of climate change and natural disasters like landslides. Management also holds regular earnings calls with transcripts made publicly available, where they discuss the nuances of GRC proceedings, cost pressures, and other challenges. The detailed explanations of the delayed 2021 GRC decision and its financial impact serve as a recent example of candor regarding a significant issue.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025), ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CWT/transcripts/'](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CWT/transcripts/)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of integrity issues such as fraud, major scandals, or significant governance-related litigation. The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the financial statements and internal controls for the year ended December 31, 2024. The "Legal Proceedings" section of the 10-K discusses operational contingencies, such as claims related to a landslide, but does not mention any issues related to management conduct, corruption, or self-dealing. The stability of the management team and board further supports a conclusion of high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1035201/000103520125000003/cwt-20241231.htm) (February 27, 2025)

---
**Synthesis**
California Water Service Group scores well on Fisher's checklist, exhibiting the key traits of a well-managed, long-term-oriented utility. Its strongest positives are its stable and essential business, a demonstrated commitment to long-range capital investment, deep and experienced management, excellent labor relations, and proficiency in the critical area of regulatory affairs. The primary negatives are structural to its industry: a lack of traditional R&D and the necessary, but dilutive, use of equity financing to fund its capital-intensive operations. The most significant variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the outcome of its 2024 General Rate Case. A favorable decision would reinforce the "Yes" answers for its sales (regulatory) organization and margin improvement actions, while an unfavorable outcome could call them into question. To flip the "No" on R&D, the company would need to establish a formal program for developing novel technologies, which is unlikely. To flip the "No" on equity financing, CWT would need to demonstrate an ability to fund its large capital program primarily through internally generated cash flow and debt, which would require a fundamental shift in its financial structure and regulatory environment.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
