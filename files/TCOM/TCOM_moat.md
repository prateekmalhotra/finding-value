### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Trip.com Group benefits from powerful cross-side network effects, particularly within its core Chinese market. A vast and diverse supplier base of hotels and airlines attracts a large user base, which in turn provides the suppliers with an indispensable demand channel. The international business is growing rapidly, indicating the network effect is expanding globally, though it is less dense than in its home market.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's international OTA platform travel bookings grew over 60% year-over-year in the first quarter of 2025. (Trip.com Group Limited (TCOM) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 19, 2025)
*   Inbound travel bookings, particularly from APAC regions, surged by 100% year-over-year in Q1 2025, demonstrating the platform's growing appeal to international travelers coming to China. (Trip.com Group Limited (TCOM) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, May 19, 2025)
*   The company operates a portfolio of brands including Ctrip, Qunar, Trip.com, and Skyscanner, which collectively create a massive user and supplier network. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for individual leisure travelers are relatively low in the online travel agency (OTA) market, as users can easily compare prices across platforms. However, Trip.com creates behavioral lock-in through its loyalty programs and one-stop-shop convenience. For corporate clients, switching costs are higher due to integrated booking and expense management solutions, but this is a smaller part of the business.
**Evidence:**
*   Corporate travel revenue was RMB573 million in Q1 2025, representing only about 4% of the total RMB13.8 billion net revenue, indicating a smaller base for high-switching-cost customers. (Trip.com Group Limited Reports Unaudited First Quarter of 2025 Financial Results, May 19, 2025)
*   The company's business model is primarily transactional, focusing on accommodation reservations and transportation ticketing, which are generally characterized by low customer switching costs. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Trip.com's massive scale, particularly in China, affords it significant bargaining power with hotels and airlines, allowing for favorable commission rates (a lower cost of revenue per booking). Furthermore, its highly automated online platform results in low marginal costs for processing additional bookings. This scale-driven cost advantage is demonstrable in its consistent profitability and strong margins.
**Evidence:**
*   Cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue was 20% for the first quarter of 2025, indicating a gross margin of approximately 80%, a strong indicator of cost efficiency. (Trip.com Group Limited Reports Unaudited First Quarter of 2025 Financial Results, May 19, 2025)
*   The company has leveraged its scale to build an efficient, centralized, and automated system for accommodation reservations and transportation ticketing. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** The company operates a powerful portfolio of brands, including the dominant Ctrip and Qunar in China, and the growing Trip.com and Skyscanner internationally. These brands are synonymous with travel in their respective markets and engender significant consumer trust. While the company leverages technology, its moat is not primarily derived from patentable IP but from the strength and recognition of its brand assets.
**Evidence:**
*   The company operates under a well-known portfolio of brands: Ctrip, Qunar, Trip.com, and Skyscanner. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
*   Trip.com Group is described as the "go-to destination for many travelers in Asia, and increasingly for travelers around the world," highlighting its brand strength. (Trip.com Group Limited Reports Unaudited First Quarter of 2025 Financial Results, May 19, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** Trip.com's distribution network is its digital platform, which has achieved a scale that would be incredibly costly and time-consuming for a new entrant to replicate, especially in the Chinese market. The company's comprehensive travel product offerings, from flights to hotels to packaged tours, create a one-stop-shop that efficiently meets traveler needs at a scale that deters new competition. The density of its supplier relationships makes its platform the most efficient place for consumers to find travel options.
**Evidence:**
*   Net revenue for Q1 2025 was RMB13.8 billion (US$1.9 billion), an increase of 16% year-over-year, demonstrating the immense scale of its operations. (Trip.com Group Limited Reports Unaudited First Quarter of 2025 Financial Results, May 19, 2025)
*   The company provides a comprehensive suite of travel products, including accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged tours, and corporate travel management. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** By processing a massive volume of travel bookings, Trip.com accumulates a vast and proprietary dataset on travel patterns, user preferences, and pricing. This data creates a powerful feedback loop, allowing the company to personalize offers, optimize pricing, and improve its AI-driven customer service, thereby enhancing the user experience and increasing conversion rates. While powerful, the advantage is constrained by data privacy regulations.
**Evidence:**
*   The company has integrated AI technologies to enhance user experience, which has increased user engagement and streamlined operations. (Trip.com Group Limited (TCOM) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript Summary, June 3, 2025)
*   The company's focus on artificial intelligence-driven solutions is a key factor expected to improve efficiency and manage costs. (Trip.com Group to Report Q1 Earnings: What's in Store for the Stock?, May 16, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Trip.com is building an ecosystem around its core travel offerings, incorporating differentiated travel content and partner services. This encourages users to spend more time on the platform for inspiration and planning, not just booking. The partnership with JTB in Japan to enhance local product offerings is an example of extending the platform by integrating third-party services.
**Evidence:**
*   The company is building a platform with "differentiated travel content" to inspire and inform travelers. (Trip.com Group Limited Reports Unaudited First Quarter of 2025 Financial Results, May 19, 2025)
*   Trip.com expanded its partnership with JTB in Japan to enhance product offerings in the local market, showing a commitment to building out its ecosystem with third parties. (Trip.com Group Limited (TCOM) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript Summary, June 3, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The online travel industry in China, Trip.com's primary market, has complex regulatory requirements for internet content providers and travel agencies. While these regulations apply to all participants, Trip.com's long operating history and established position give it a compliance advantage and represent a barrier to new, especially foreign, entrants. However, the company is also subject to significant regulatory risks, including antitrust scrutiny.
**Evidence:**
*   As a China-based company listed in the U.S. and Hong Kong, the company navigates a complex web of regulations in multiple jurisdictions. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
*   The expansion of visa-free policies in China is cited as a significant growth opportunity, highlighting the influence of government regulation on the business. (Trip.com Group Limited (TCOM) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript Summary, June 3, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The core assets of Trip.com are its technology platforms and brands, which required significant upfront investment in software development and marketing to build. While not as capital-intensive as heavy manufacturing, the scale of its proprietary technology and brand investment represents a significant sunk cost and a deterrent to new entrants who would need to spend heavily over many years to compete.
**Evidence:**
*   Product development expenses for Q1 2025 were RMB3.1 billion, demonstrating the significant ongoing investment required to maintain and enhance its technology platform. (Trip.com Group Limited Reports Unaudited First Quarter of 2025 Financial Results, May 19, 2025)
*   The company has made substantial investments in its technology and infrastructure since its founding in 1999. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** The vast majority of Trip.com's revenue is transactional and booked close to the time of travel, providing limited long-term revenue visibility. There are no long-term contracts with leisure customers. While corporate travel has some recurring elements, it is a very small portion of the overall business, leading to low visibility and a low score on this dimension.
**Evidence:**
*   Revenue is primarily generated from accommodation and transportation ticketing commissions, which are recognized at the time of service, not long-term contracts. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
*   The business is subject to seasonality, with revenue fluctuating based on holiday periods, indicating a lack of smooth, recurring revenue streams. (Trip.com Group Limited Reports Unaudited First Quarter of 2025 Financial Results, May 19, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (4 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 0.72 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.24 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.02 = 3.15
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 63.0 / 100 (multiplying the 3.15 by 20 to scale to 100)

### **Mapping to Moat Rating**
*   The weighted score of 63.0 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range, which corresponds to a moat rating of 3.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The company's moat is primarily built on the powerful network effects and brand recognition of Ctrip and Qunar within China, which is a mature and defensible position. This core advantage is durable and difficult to displace. We estimate a moat duration of **8–12 years**, as the key risks are not near-term events but rather long-term shifts in technology (e.g., a new AI-native travel platform) or significant, adverse regulatory action that could erode the company's market structure advantages.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Intensified Regulatory Scrutiny:** Increased antitrust enforcement from Chinese regulators could limit Trip.com's ability to leverage its scale, potentially forcing changes to its supplier relationships that would weaken its network effects. (Trip.com Group Filed 2024 Annual Report on Form 20-F, April 11, 2025)
2.  **Geopolitical Tensions:** A significant escalation in geopolitical tensions could severely dampen international and inbound travel demand, neutralizing the company's high-growth global platforms and reducing overall scale.
3.  **Disruption from New Technology:** A new competitor leveraging generative AI could create a superior travel planning and booking experience, bypassing the traditional OTA model and eroding Trip.com's user base over time. (Trip.com Group Limited (TCOM) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript Summary, June 3, 2025)

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **International Revenue Growth:** Sustained growth above 20% indicates successful global expansion; a slowdown could signal the moat is not translating to new markets.
*   **Gross Margins:** A decline below 75% could indicate intensifying price competition or weakening bargaining power with suppliers.
*   **Market Share in China (Domestic Accommodation/Air):** Any significant loss of share from domestic competitors would be a primary indicator of moat erosion.
*   **User Acquisition Costs (Sales & Marketing as % of Revenue):** A sustained increase suggests weakening brand loyalty and network effects.
*   **Take Rates (Revenue / Gross Transaction Value):** A declining take rate signals pressure on commission rates from suppliers.
*   **Growth in Corporate Travel Segment:** Stagnation would indicate failure to build a user base with higher switching costs.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
Trip.com possesses a moderate moat, earning a rating of 3 out of 5. Its primary strength lies in the formidable network effects and brand power established in the Chinese domestic market, creating a wide competitive barrier. However, the moat is less pronounced internationally, and the transactional nature of the business results in low switching costs and limited revenue visibility. The rating is appropriate as the company's advantages are substantial but not unassailable. A rating increase would require evidence of significantly higher switching costs or the establishment of a global network effect as dominant as its domestic one. Conversely, signs of margin compression from competition or adverse regulatory actions in China would justify a downgrade.

moat rating is 3 / 5
