***

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below has a clear path to significant sales growth through new store openings. The company operated 1,771 stores as of February 1, 2025, and management believes it has the potential for more than 3,500 locations in the U.S. over time, indicating a runway to more than double its physical footprint. For fiscal 2025, the company plans to open approximately 150 new stores. This unit growth is the primary driver of the company's long-term sales potential.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a commitment to evolving its model beyond simple store expansion. The company has rolled out its "Five Beyond" pricing strategy, which introduces products at prices above the traditional $5 cap, expanding the addressable market within each store. The company emphasizes a "dynamic, edited assortment of trend-right, high-quality products" across eight distinct "worlds," indicating a continuous focus on merchandising innovation to maintain customer interest and drive repeat traffic. Further investment in e-commerce and its mobile app also shows a commitment to developing new sales channels.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a retailer, research and development is embodied by merchandising, product development, and investments in store concepts and supply chain. Five Below's product development and merchandising teams work to identify and source "trend-right" products to keep the store assortment fresh and exciting. The company’s capital expenditures of $324.0 million in fiscal 2024 were directed at new stores, remodels, and distribution centers, which are the key drivers of its growth. The historical success of the store model and its expansion is evidence that this approach to "R&D" is highly effective for its business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below's sales growth is primarily a function of its rapid store expansion, with a compounded annual growth rate of 12.3% from fiscal 2022 to 2024. However, the company's ability to drive sales at existing locations has recently faltered. Comparable sales decreased by 2.7% in fiscal 2024, driven entirely by a 2.7% decline in transactions. This indicates a current weakness in driving organic growth from its established store base.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, Five Below achieved a gross margin of 34.9% and an operating margin of 8.4%. While this represents a decrease from 35.8% and 10.8% respectively in fiscal 2023, the margins remain healthy for the discount retail sector. The ability to generate an 8.4% operating margin while maintaining a low-price value proposition is indicative of a worthwhile margin structure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing several avenues to improve margins. The company's growth strategy is expected to create economies of scale, particularly in the supply chain, which will leverage costs. The company has also strategically increased prices on select items through its "Five Beyond" initiative to mitigate rising product and operational costs. In its Q1 2025 earnings call, management identified managing inventory shrinkage as a key priority to address margin pressure.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/FIVE/transcripts/'](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/FIVE/transcripts/) (June 4, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company dedicates a "Human Capital" section in its 10-K to outlining its culture, values, and employee benefits. It reports that none of its employees are part of a collective bargaining agreement. Crucially, Five Below conducts an annual employee survey with Gallup and states that "overall engagement levels continue to outperform the Gallup Retail Industry Company Database Levels in the United States," providing a quantitative, third-party benchmark for its positive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable and aligned. A planned leadership transition occurred in December 2024 with Winnie Park becoming CEO. The company has standard executive compensation structures, including equity incentive plans and a severance plan, designed to retain and motivate senior leadership. There are no disclosures in the primary documents reviewed that suggest any instability or discord among the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's disclosures suggest a deep bench of management talent. The 10-K describes its senior management team as having "extensive retail experience across a broad range of disciplines." Beyond the named executive officers, the company highlights key roles such as the Senior Vice President of Merchandising and an operational structure that includes regional directors and district managers, indicating multiple layers of experienced leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's accounting controls appear robust. For the fiscal year ended February 1, 2025, management assessed its internal controls over financial reporting as effective. Furthermore, the company's independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. There are no disclosed restatements or material weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below's primary competitive advantage lies in its unique and defensible niche. The business model combines a "treasure hunt" shopping experience with trend-right merchandise specifically targeting teens and tweens at extreme value prices. This is supported by a disciplined real estate strategy of clustering stores in high-traffic shopping centers to build brand density and a nimble supply chain with approximately 1,000 vendors, reducing dependence on any single partner. This combination creates a strong moat that is difficult for mass merchants or other specialty retailers to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy is fundamentally oriented towards long-range growth. Management's explicit goal to grow from 1,771 to over 3,500 stores evidences a multi-year investment horizon. Significant capital expenditures, totaling $324.0 million in fiscal 2024, are being allocated to new stores and shipcenters to support this long-term expansion rather than maximizing short-term profits. This consistent reinvestment in growth demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice near-term results for future market share and profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Below's financial position is very strong. As of February 1, 2025, the company had $331.7 million in cash and cash equivalents and no direct borrowings on its $225 million revolving credit facility. It generated $430.6 million in cash from operations in fiscal 2024, which is more than sufficient to cover its planned capital expenditures. The company has also been actively repurchasing shares ($40.0 million in fiscal 2024), demonstrating that it is returning capital to shareholders, not seeking to raise it through dilutive means.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company maintains consistent communication with investors through regular channels. It files detailed quarterly and annual reports that include extensive "Risk Factors" sections outlining potential challenges. Management hosts quarterly earnings calls, and transcripts are publicly available for periods of both strong and weak performance, such as the recent discussion of negative comparable sales. There is no indication that management avoids discussing difficult topics.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/FIVE/transcripts/'](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/FIVE/transcripts/) (June 4, 2025), ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company has many positive indicators of strong governance, including a code of conduct and a clean opinion from its auditor on internal controls, its integrity cannot be deemed "unquestionable" at this time. The 10-K discloses an active putative securities class action lawsuit filed in August 2024, which alleges violations in connection with public statements. Although the company believes the action is without merit and intends to defend itself vigorously, the existence of such a lawsuit prevents a clear "Yes" answer until the matter is resolved.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1177609/000117760925000009/five-20250201.htm) (March 20, 2025)

Synthesis:
Five Below scores well on most of Fisher's points, exhibiting the hallmarks of a growth company with a long runway, a committed management team, and a strong financial position. Its primary strengths are a clearly defined and expandable store-based growth strategy and a unique, defensible market niche that generates healthy profits. The two main variables that could change the score in the next 12–24 months are its sales productivity and the resolution of its outstanding securities litigation. A return to positive comparable store sales would flip the "Above-Average Sales Organization" point to Yes, signaling that the company can drive organic growth in addition to expansionary growth. A favorable resolution or dismissal of the class-action lawsuit would be required to change the "Unquestionable Integrity" point to Yes, removing the only current blemish on its governance and reputation.

fisher score is 13 / 15
