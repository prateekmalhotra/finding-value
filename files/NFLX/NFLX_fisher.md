Synthesis:
Netflix scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and financial strength. The company's management team is stable, experienced, and transparent with investors. The primary area of concern is labor and personnel relations, given the company's high-profile position in the entertainment industry and ongoing union negotiations. The two to three variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the advertising-supported tier, the growth of the gaming initiative, and the ability to manage content costs effectively. To flip the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes," Netflix would need to demonstrate a sustained period of positive and stable relationships with its employees and Hollywood unions, free from major disputes or controversies.

fisher score is 14 / 15
