### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

After a review of the latest earnings call transcripts and SEC filings, **Employers Holdings, Inc. has not provided explicit quantitative guidance for future revenue growth, margin targets, or capital expenditures.** Management commentary focuses on maintaining underwriting discipline, managing claims trends, and capitalizing on favorable market conditions in the workers' compensation space. The absence of specific numerical targets necessitates a reliance on historical performance and conservative assumptions.

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value/Rationale | Citation/Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **4.0% annually** | Based on the 3-year historical revenue CAGR, which reflects stable growth in a mature industry. This is a conservative estimate assuming continued policy retention and modest new business growth. |
| **Operating Margin** | **14.1% (stable)** | The LTM operating margin. Without specific management guidance on margin expansion initiatives, a stable margin is assumed, reflecting consistent underwriting performance. |
| **Tax Rate** | **21.0%** | The U.S. statutory federal corporate tax rate, which aligns with the company's historical effective tax rates, normalizing for any period-specific adjustments. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **2.1%** | Based on the LTM capex relative to LTM revenue, consistent with historical averages for a business with low capital intensity. |
| **Change in WC as % of Revenue** | **4.0%** | Based on the LTM change in working capital relative to LTM revenue, reflecting investments needed to support growth. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **1.4%** | Based on the LTM stock-based compensation as a percentage of revenue, assumed to remain stable. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure changes.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.25% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield (August 21, 2025) [U.S. Treasury Dept.]. |
| Beta (Î²) | 0.84 | 5-Year Monthly Beta for EIG, reflecting lower volatility than the overall market, which is typical for insurance companies [Yahoo Finance]. |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 6.00% | A standard premium used for mature markets, reflecting the excess return investors expect over the risk-free rate. |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **7.15%** | LTM Interest Expense / Total Debt ($14.2M / $198.5M). |
| Market Cap (E) | $1,213.7M | Diluted Shares * Current Share Price (26.1M * $46.50). |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Component | Value | Calculation / Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | **2.5%** | A conservative long-term growth rate, in line with long-run inflation expectations and reflecting the mature nature of the insurance industry. |
| **Terminal Value** | **$1,068.5M** | `(Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)` = `($65.0 * 1.025) / (8.74% - 2.50%)` |
| **Present Value of TV** | **$703.9M** | `Terminal Value / (1 + WACC)^5` |
| **Cross-Check: Exit Multiple** | | |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $179.0M | Year 5 EBIT ($152.8M) + Year 5 D&A ($26.2M) |
| Implied Exit Multiple | **5.97x** | Terminal Value / Year 5 EBITDA ($1,068.5M / $179.0M) |
| *Justification* | The implied 5.97x EBITDA multiple is reasonable and aligns with the historical trading range for stable insurance companies, providing confidence in the Gordon Growth method. |

| **Low / Bear Case** | **$60.50** | Assumes lower revenue growth (2.0%) and margin compression (13.0%), leading to lower FCFF and terminal value. |
| **High / Bull Case** | **$88.75** | Assumes higher revenue growth (5.5%) and modest margin expansion (15.0%) due to favorable pricing cycles. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$52.58** | `Base-Case Fair Value * (1 - 0.30)` |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory Risk:** The workers' compensation insurance industry is highly regulated at the state level. Changes in regulations regarding pricing, coverage mandates, or capital requirements could adversely affect profitability.
2.  **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** As a holder of a large investment portfolio, EIG's net investment income is sensitive to changes in interest rates. A prolonged low-interest-rate environment could suppress earnings.
3.  **Competitive Pressure:** The workers' compensation market is competitive. Intense competition on pricing and policy terms could lead to lower growth or weaker underwriting margins than projected in the base case.
4.  **Catastrophic Losses:** While primarily focused on workers' compensation, unforeseen catastrophic events (e.g., pandemics, large-scale industrial accidents) could lead to unexpectedly high claims, impacting financial stability.
