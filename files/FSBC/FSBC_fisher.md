Five Star Bancorp (FSBC), August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Star Bancorp provides core banking services (commercial and personal loans, deposits) in Northern California, a large and economically diverse market. The bank is actively expanding its footprint, notably with a new full-service branch opened in the San Francisco Bay Area in September 2024, supported by a significant hiring initiative. This expansion into a major metropolitan market provides a substantial runway for growth. The company has demonstrated strong execution, with total loans growing from $3.1 billion at year-end 2023 to $3.6 billion as of March 31, 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a clear commitment to growth beyond its established markets. The strategic expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area, which included hiring a team of 17 professionals in 2024, is the primary evidence of this determination. Furthermore, the company states it continues to make significant investments in its information technology systems to support scalability, enhance customer experience, and improve efficiency. This dual focus on geographic expansion and technological improvement shows a commitment to developing processes that increase sales potential.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a community bank, "R&D" is best measured by investments in technology to drive efficiency and enhance service. The company reports making significant investments in technology, utilizing cloud/hosted models from nationally recognized vendors for core systems and data processing. However, the filings do not provide specific metrics on technology spend as a percentage of revenue or quantifiable outcomes (e.g., proprietary product launches, patent filings) that would allow for a direct comparison of effectiveness against peers. The company appears to be a proficient technology adopter rather than an innovator, making it difficult to verify that its efforts are more effective than competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's loan and deposit growth rates indicate a highly effective sales (business development) organization. Total loans held for investment grew by 14.6% in 2024, and total deposits grew by 17.6% in the same period. This growth demonstrates a strong ability to capture market share. The company's model is relationship-driven, and its successful expansion into the competitive Bay Area market, spearheaded by a newly hired team, further supports the conclusion that its sales and development capabilities are above average.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Five Star Bancorp exhibits strong profitability metrics that are indicative of worthwhile profit margins. For the first quarter of 2025, the bank reported a Return on Average Assets (ROAA) of 1.30% and a Return on Average Equity (ROAE) of 13.28%. An ROAA above 1% and an ROAE above 10% are generally considered strong performance benchmarks in the banking industry. The Net Interest Margin (NIM) was a healthy 3.45% for the same period. These figures demonstrate a high level of profitability relative to the bank's asset base and equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm' (Filed: May 2, 2025)]

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively taking steps to protect and improve margins. A key source of funding is non-interest-bearing demand deposits, which comprised 25.0% of total deposits at March 31, 2025, helping to control funding costs. The company also emphasizes a "disciplined cost management culture" and leverages technology to enhance efficiency, as reflected in its strong efficiency ratio of 42.58% in Q1 2025. On the asset side, the loan portfolio is actively managed for yield, with loan interest income increasing significantly due to both higher balances and improved yields.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm' (Filed: May 2, 2025)]

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states, "We consider our relationship with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations due to labor disagreements." It also notes investments in employee growth and development and a commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion. However, these are standard corporate disclosures. There is no verifiable, publicly available data, such as employee turnover rates or independent engagement surveys, to substantiate that its labor relations are "outstanding" compared to peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent strategy and strong performance suggest a stable and cohesive executive team. The risk factors in the 10-K highlight a dependency on the existing management team, implying their value and stability. Furthermore, significant insider ownership (approximately 34.5% post-IPO) aligns the interests of management and directors with those of shareholders, fostering a stable environment. There are no disclosures indicating executive turnover or disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's governance structure indicates management depth beyond the key executive officers. The 10-K describes a Management Loan Committee that includes the CEO, Chief Credit Officer, and other members of management and senior loan officers, showing distribution of key credit responsibilities. The company has also appointed executives to specific roles like a Director of Information Security and a Chief Operating Officer who leads DE&I efforts, suggesting a professionalized management layer with defined responsibilities.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings demonstrate strong accounting controls. The report from their independent registered public accounting firm, Moss Adams LLP, for the year ended December 31, 2024, provided an unqualified opinion, indicating the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects. In the 10-K, management concluded that as of December 31, 2024, the company's disclosure controls and procedures were effective. There is no mention of any material weaknesses, restatements, or auditor disagreements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A critical differentiator in banking is credit quality, and FSBC excels here. As of March 31, 2025, the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans held for investment was exceptionally low at 0.05%. This indicates a highly disciplined and effective underwriting process compared to industry norms. Additionally, the bank's stated niche focus on real estate, agricultural, and faith-based enterprises allows it to build deep expertise and relationships that larger, more generalized competitors may lack. Its ability to grow deposit market share against much larger banks in its home market is another strong indicator of its competitive advantage in service and execution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm' (Filed: May 2, 2025)]

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's actions demonstrate a long-range outlook. The company is making significant upfront investments in its San Francisco Bay Area expansion, including hiring a large team and opening a new branch, which temporarily increased non-interest expense and impacted the 2024 efficiency ratio. This willingness to absorb short-term costs for entry into a major new market is a clear sign of prioritizing long-term growth. This is further supported by stated investments in technology to provide "scalability for future growth."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is very well-capitalized, with capital ratios significantly exceeding regulatory minimums for a "well-capitalized" institution as of March 31, 2025. The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio was 11.00% against a 6.50% threshold. The company is highly profitable, with a 13.28% ROAE in Q1 2025, allowing it to generate significant internal capital through retained earnings to fund future growth. Although the company raised $80.9 million via an equity offering in April 2024, it was described as a measure to support *continued* growth, suggesting it was opportunistic rather than necessary. Given its current strong capital base and internal capital generation, the bank is well-positioned to fund its organic growth without needing to issue dilutive equity in the near term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025), 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000106/fsbc-20250331.htm' (Filed: May 2, 2025)]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's SEC filings exhibit a high degree of candor. The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section openly addresses challenges, such as the factors leading to a temporary increase in the efficiency ratio and pressures on the net interest margin. The "Risk Factors" section is comprehensive and does not shy away from detailing potential vulnerabilities, including its concentration in Northern California real estate and dependence on key personnel. This level of transparency in official filings, where management must attest to the information, is a strong indicator of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no red flags to suggest a lack of integrity. The 10-K discloses no material legal proceedings that would call integrity into question. The independent auditor's report is clean, and the company attests to the effectiveness of its internal controls. Related-party transactions, such as office leases and the purchase of subordinated notes by insiders, are disclosed. The absence of regulatory enforcement actions, material litigation, and accounting scandals supports the conclusion of a management team with high integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1275168/000127516825000038/fsbc-20241231.htm' (Filed: February 28, 2025)]

### Synthesis

Five Star Bancorp scores well on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting the characteristics of a high-quality, growth-oriented community bank. Its strongest positives are its outstanding profitability (ROAA > 1.3%, ROAE > 13%), exceptionally strong credit quality with near-zero nonperforming loans, and a clear strategy for growth demonstrated by its recent expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area. Management appears stable, aligned with shareholders through significant insider ownership, and transparent in its financial reporting. The two "No" answers relate to areas where "outstanding" performance could not be definitively verified with public data (R&D effectiveness, labor relations), rather than indicating clear deficiencies.

The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12–24 months are the execution of the Bay Area expansion and the management of credit quality in a shifting economic environment. Success in the new market would further validate the strength of the sales organization and long-range planning. Conversely, any notable deterioration in the bank's pristine asset quality, particularly within its significant commercial real estate portfolio, would be a major red flag and flip the "Industry-Specific Clues" point to a "No". Evidence that would change a "No" to a "Yes" would include third-party awards for being a top workplace (for Labor Relations) or the successful launch of a proprietary, efficiency-driving technology platform (for R&D Effectiveness).

### fisher score is 13 / 15
