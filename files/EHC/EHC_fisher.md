Company: Encompass Health Corporation (EHC)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2025 (filed August 6, 2025), and Q2 2025 earnings call summaries (dated August 5, 2025).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Encompass Health is the largest U.S. owner and operator of inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs). The company's growth is supported by powerful demographic trends, as most of its patients are 65 or older. Management notes in its June 30, 2025, 10-Q that the number of Medicare enrollees is expected to grow, with the 75+ population segment growing at approximately 4% per year through 2030. This aging population is expected to drive long-term demand for the specialized rehabilitative services EHC provides for complex conditions like stroke, neurological disorders, and orthopedic injuries.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear and active commitment to growth through capacity expansion. During the first half of 2025, EHC opened two new hospitals and added 51 new beds to existing facilities. The company's development pipeline detailed in its June 30, 2025, filing includes 17 additional de novo hospitals and further bed additions planned for 2025 through 2027. This steady cadence of new facility development ("de novo" projects) is a core part of the company's strategy to meet growing demand.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a healthcare services provider, Encompass Health does not have a traditional R&D function focused on creating new products. While the company pursues process improvements and leverages technology, there are no specific, quantifiable metrics on R&D spending or output in its public filings comparable to a technology or pharmaceutical company. An August 5, 2025, earnings call summary mentioned leveraging AI technologies to enhance operational efficiency, but the impact is not yet detailed or quantified.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For EHC, "sales" are driven by patient referrals from acute-care hospitals. The company's ability to consistently grow patient volume suggests an effective referral network and strong clinical reputation. In the second quarter of 2025, total patient discharges grew 7.2%, with a 4.7% increase in same-store discharges, indicating healthy underlying demand and effective relationship management with referral sources. This consistent volume growth in a competitive healthcare landscape points to a high-functioning business development and marketing organization.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the three months ended June 30, 2025, Encompass Health reported Net Operating Revenues of $1,457.7 million and Income from Continuing Operations before tax of $236.8 million, yielding a pre-tax margin of 16.2%. Adjusted EBITDA, a key metric for the company, was $318.6 million for the quarter, for a margin of 21.9%. This represented a year-over-year increase from 20.9% in Q2 2024, demonstrating strong and improving profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through operational efficiency, particularly in labor management. In its Q2 2025 10-Q, the company noted that Salaries and Benefits as a percentage of revenue decreased year-over-year. This was "primarily due a decline in EPOB [employees per occupied bed] and decreases in both contract labor and sign-on and shift bonuses," indicating successful cost control initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/785161/000078516125000052/ehc-20250630.htm (August 6, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings note significant challenges in the healthcare labor market. The MD&A section of the Q2 2025 10-Q discusses "a challenging staffing environment," "staffing shortages," and competition resulting in "increased labor costs, including significant sign-on and shift bonuses." While the company is managing these costs, the language used indicates a strained, not outstanding, labor environment. There is no positive, verifiable evidence of superior employee satisfaction or relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/785161/000078516125000052/ehc-20250630.htm (August 6, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows significant stability and tenure. CEO Mark J. Tarr has been with the company since 1993 and has served as CEO since 2016. CFO Douglas E. Coltharp has been in his role since 2010. This longevity among top leadership suggests a stable and cohesive executive team. There is no public evidence of unusual turnover or executive disagreements.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Encompass Health's public leadership information displays a deep and experienced management team beyond the CEO and CFO. The team includes a Chief Operating Officer, Chief Medical Officer, General Counsel, Chief Human Resources Officer, and multiple Senior Vice Presidents overseeing key functions like finance, accounting, and business development. The company also has several regional presidents, indicating a strong layer of operational leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGZlZBKMwwfnXyhkI-OmrVu1xUk-CbpHK7NfFb2qCRVE9l5BoiTt3e73XPscKGneNWCMw5_4-jge6SjgyHwtNwWdYDgnGOYZGhK0ib80s7yNJbNGpI6iRtu9kyvFJnlbaeQEq4fj2tY8dqGb7BwWVIfv_s= (Accessed August 24, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Form 10-Q filed on August 6, 2025, management disclosed its evaluation of the company's disclosure controls and procedures. The CEO and CFO concluded that "our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report." There have been no recent restatements or publicized issues with internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/785161/000078516125000052/ehc-20250630.htm (August 6, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As the nation's largest operator of IRFs, Encompass Health benefits from significant scale advantages in purchasing, contracting, and data analysis. Management highlighted on its Q2 2025 earnings call a key competitive advantage: a focus on complex medical conditions. It noted that discharges for neurological conditions and stroke grew 12% and 6.7% respectively in the quarter, demonstrating deep clinical expertise in high-acuity patient populations that are central to the IRF model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEFu50SeDhACrAaPLFvHJyFONvbxzV-4iqWuGk5DzC583Iv5JujwbaXWu_hC6Uw19dlUzcSPdAStmd_-zwOKbGalshWY5dLNHdTgTrWadvB3MxjnX-qYZzT7TWh-AUhkOCCnB1LdWA= (August 10, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company consistently allocates significant capital to long-term growth projects. For 2025, EHC expects to spend approximately $785 million to $820 million on capital expenditures, primarily for de novo hospitals and capacity expansions. This substantial reinvestment in its core business, which will not generate immediate profits, demonstrates a clear focus on building a larger, more profitable enterprise for the long term, balanced with shareholder returns like dividends and buybacks.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/785161/000078516125000052/ehc-20250630.htm (August 6, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is strong, with primary liquidity sources being cash from operations and its revolving credit facility. As of June 30, 2025, the company had $953 million available under its credit facility and no significant debt maturities until 2028. Rather than issuing shares, EHC has a history of repurchasing them, buying back 0.6 million shares for $56.8 million in the first half of 2025. This indicates a strong capacity to fund its growth pipeline through cash flow and debt without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/785161/000078516125000052/ehc-20250630.htm (August 6, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q2 2025 earnings discussion, management provided clear and specific drivers for its strong performance. For example, the CFO detailed that a decrease in bad debt expense was related to a reduction in certain Medicare claim reviews, a level of transparency that is helpful to investors. The company also raised its full-year guidance for revenue and earnings, clearly outlining the key assumptions behind the new forecast. This transparency in both reporting results and setting expectations demonstrates candor.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In June 2019, the company agreed to pay a $48 million settlement to resolve U.S. Department of Justice allegations of fraudulent Medicare billing. The allegations, brought via whistleblower lawsuits, claimed the company provided inaccurate patient diagnosis information to Medicare and that some admissions were not medically necessary. While this settlement relates to conduct that occurred several years ago and the current management team has been in place for some time, a federal fraud settlement of this nature prevents an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**

Encompass Health scores well on the majority of Fisher's points, reflecting its position as a market leader with a clear growth path and a stable, experienced management team. The company's strongest attributes are its long runway for growth due to an aging population, a disciplined and proven strategy of expanding capacity through new hospitals, strong financial health that precludes shareholder dilution, and high and improving profit margins. The primary negatives are centered on the challenging healthcare labor environment and a 2019 Medicare fraud settlement that calls the company's integrity into question. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are labor relations and R&D effectiveness. A "No" on labor could flip to "Yes" with evidence of meaningfully lower employee turnover or industry-leading satisfaction scores. The "No" on R&D could change if the company's investments in AI and technology begin to yield quantifiable impacts on margins or clinical outcomes that management explicitly details for investors.

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
