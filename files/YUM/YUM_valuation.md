*   **Unit Growth:** The company expects "5% unit growth" for the fiscal year. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 2025)
*   **G&A Expenses:** General and administrative expenses are expected to be "flattish" year-over-year. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, August 2025)

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | 5.5% | Based on the "5% unit growth" guidance and slight outperformance from same-store sales growth, reflecting historical trends and management's positive tone. |
| **Operating (EBIT) Margin** | 36.3% | Stable margin reflecting the TTM period, consistent with the company's highly franchised model. No specific margin expansion initiatives were quantified by management. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 21.0% | The average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years, normalizing for any one-time items. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 5.4% | The average capital intensity over the last three fiscal years, aligning with a mature, franchised business model. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 1.8% | Consistent with the TTM average, reflecting ongoing equity compensation practices. |
| **Working Capital as % of Δ Revenue** | 2.5% | Based on the historical relationship between working capital changes and revenue growth over the past three years. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $7,501 | $7,914 | $8,349 | $8,808 | $9,293 |
| **EBIT** | **$2,723** | **$2,873** | **$3,031** | **$3,198** | **$3,374** |
| Taxes on EBIT | ($572) | ($603) | ($637) | ($672) | ($709) |
| **NOPAT** | **$2,151** | **$2,270** | **$2,394** | **$2,526** | **$2,665** |
| \+ D&A | $419 | $442 | $466 | $492 | $519 |
| \- Stock-Based Comp | ($135) | ($142) | ($150) | ($159) | ($167) |
| \- Capex | ($405) | ($427) | ($451) | ($476) | ($502) |

| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)**| **$2,020** | **$2,132** | **$2,248** | **$2,373** | **$2,504** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation & Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **9.11%** | `Ke = Rf + Beta * ERP` |
| Risk-Free Rate (Rf) | 4.25% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of August 20, 2025. |
| Equity Risk Premium (ERP) | 5.00% | Standard premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta (β) | 0.97 | 5-Year (monthly) Beta, reflecting market risk slightly below the average. |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **4.61%** | `TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt` ($520M / $11,273M). |
| Tax Rate | 21.0% | See assumptions. |
| Market Cap (E) | $36,790 M | Share price of $130 x 283M shares. |
| Total Debt (D) | $11,273 M | See baseline financials. |
| **WACC** | **7.53%** | `(E/(E+D))*Ke + (D/(E+D))*Kd*(1-Tax Rate)` |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method & Inputs | Value | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Method**| | `TV = FCFF_5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)` |
| Terminal FCFF (FCFF_5) | $2,504 M | Final year of explicit forecast. |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g)| 2.50% | Assumed to be in line with long-term inflation expectations. |
| WACC | 7.53% | See discount rate calculation. |
| **Terminal Value (TV)**| **$50,916 M** | `$2,504 * (1 + 0.025) / (0.0753 - 0.025)` |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| | An exit multiple provides a sanity check on the terminal value. A historical median EV/EBITDA multiple for YUM and its peers is in the 15-18x range. |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $4,312 M | `EBIT_5 + D&A_5` ($3,374M + $519M) plus other non-cash charges. |
| Implied TV @ 16x | $68,992 M | A 16x multiple suggests a higher terminal value, indicating the Gordon Growth assumption is reasonably conservative. The lower Gordon Growth TV is used. |

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Forecast FCFF** | $9,687 M | Sum of discounted FCFF for Years 1-5. |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | $35,461 M | `$50,916 / (1 + 0.0753)^5` |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$45,148 M**| `PV of FCFF + PV of TV` |
| \- Total Debt | ($11,273 M)| See baseline financials. |
| \+ Cash & Equivalents | $471 M | See baseline financials. |
| **Equity Value** | **$34,346 M**| `Enterprise Value - Net Debt` |

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Metric | Value | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Diluted Shares | 283 M | See baseline financials. |
| **Base-Case Fair Value**| **$121.36** | `Equity Value / Diluted Shares` |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **~$95** | Assumes lower revenue growth (3.5%) and margin compression (35.0%), leading to lower FCFF. |
| **High/Bull Case** | **~$150**| Assumes higher revenue growth (7.0%) and slight margin expansion (37.0%) from operational leverage. |
| **Margin of Safety (30%)**| **$84.95** | `Base-Case Fair Value * (1 - 0.30)` |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Franchisee Health:** YUM's success is highly dependent on the financial health and operational execution of its franchisees, who are sensitive to inflation, labor costs, and financing conditions.
2.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** As a quick-service restaurant operator, sales are vulnerable to downturns in the economic cycle and shifts in consumer spending habits.
3.  **Competitive Pressure:** The QSR industry is intensely competitive. Failure to innovate in menu offerings, technology (e.g., digital and delivery), and value propositions could lead to market share loss.
4.  **International Exposure:** Significant international operations expose the company to geopolitical risks, currency fluctuations, and varying regulatory environments, which can impact reported earnings.
5.  **Food Safety and Supply Chain:** Any disruption in the supply chain or a significant food safety incident could cause severe reputational damage and financial loss.
