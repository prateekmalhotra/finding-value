### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** OneSpaWorld's business model as a service provider on cruise ships and at resorts does not benefit from traditional network effects. The value of the service for one guest does not increase as more guests use the service. The company's value is derived from its direct relationships with hospitality partners, not from a user network.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is described as a "global services company" that operates health and wellness centers, with value derived from partnerships, not a user network. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** High switching costs are evident from the long-term, embedded nature of OSW's contracts with cruise lines. These partners would face significant operational disruption, logistical complexity, and potential service quality risk to replace OSW across an entire fleet, especially given OSW's deep integration into ship design and operations. The high contract renewal rate is strong evidence of this lock-in.
**Evidence:**
*   Agreements with cruise lines range from three to 8.6 years in duration, with an average length of approximately five years. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   The company has an exceptional contract renewal rate, having renewed approximately 97% of its contracts based on ship count over the last 15 years, including 100% of contracts for ships with more than 3,500 berths. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   Most cruise line agreements cover 100% of the partner's existing fleet and all new ships introduced during the contract term, indicating deep, long-term integration. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** OSW's significant scale (over 90% market share) provides a cost advantage through its global recruiting, training, and supply chain logistics. This large, centralized system for staffing and supplying nearly 200 moving vessels is a complex and efficient operation that a smaller competitor would find uneconomical to replicate, allowing OSW to manage its primary costs—labor and supplies—more effectively. While margins are not directly compared to peers, the description of their model supports a scale-based cost advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   OSW's business model includes a "powerful staff recruiting, training and logistics platform and global operations infrastructure" that the company believes is "not economically feasible to replicate". (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   The company manages the "complex delivery of all products and supplies to our health and wellness centers onboard 199 vessels," leveraging proprietary data to forecast and stock each center. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   In 2024, OSW placed over 6,200 individuals, with over 71% having been previously employed by the company, suggesting an efficient and deep labor pool that reduces recruitment and training costs. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** OSW's intangible assets are moderately strong, primarily stemming from exclusive distribution agreements with key product suppliers and its own proprietary brands. The exclusive at-sea partnership with ELEMIS is a significant asset that enhances its service offering and creates a barrier for competitors wanting to offer the same popular product line. While the OSW brand itself may not be a primary driver for cruise passengers, its proprietary spa brands like Mandara add value for resort partners.
**Evidence:**
*   OSW holds an exclusive supply agreement with ELEMIS for the cruise market with a remaining term of approximately 6.5 years as of December 31, 2024, plus a five-year renewal option at OSW's election. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   The company offers renowned brands such as Kérastase®, Dysport®, and CoolSculpting®, with many offered exclusively by OSW in the cruise market. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   OSW operates health and wellness centers under its proprietary brands, including Mandara® (36 centers) and Chavana® (11 centers), as of December 31, 2024. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** OSW's moat is powerfully defined by its dominant and exclusive distribution network across the cruise industry. With over 90% market share and long-standing, fleet-wide contracts with nearly every major cruise line, the market is effectively saturated, leaving little room for a new entrant to gain a foothold. This efficient scale makes it highly unattractive for a competitor to attempt to replicate the necessary global infrastructure and partner relationships.
**Evidence:**
*   OSW is the market leader in the outsourced maritime health and wellness market, with an estimated market share exceeding 90%. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   As of December 31, 2024, OSW operated health and wellness centers on 199 ships, serving major cruise lines including Carnival, Royal Caribbean, and Norwegian, which together account for 167 of the 199 ships. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   Relationships with cruise line partners average over 20 years, demonstrating an entrenched position that would be difficult for a new competitor to challenge. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 5 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** While OSW possesses a significant amount of data on guest preferences and spending, the evidence of a proprietary data feedback loop creating a durable competitive advantage is weak. The company uses data for operational purposes like inventory forecasting and targeted promotions, but the 10-K does not detail a unique, hard-to-replicate data asset that systematically improves the product and locks in customers in a way competitors cannot match.
**Evidence:**
*   The company leverages proprietary data to accurately forecast and stock each health and wellness center. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   Personalized promotions based on guest profiles were responsible for approximately 10% of revenues in the year ended December 31, 2024, showing data is used for marketing, but not necessarily indicating a deep, proprietary advantage. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** OSW operates as a direct service provider, not a platform or ecosystem. There is no evidence of third-party developers, a complementary product marketplace, or other ecosystem characteristics that would create a competitive advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is described as operating health and wellness centers through direct service provision, not as a platform connecting third parties. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The company is subject to standard international, federal, and local laws governing business operations, labor, and health and safety. However, the 10-K provides no evidence of possessing unique, material licenses, patents with long expiry dates, or other regulatory barriers that would prevent a competitor from entering the market.
**Evidence:**
*   The "Government Regulation" section of the 10-K describes being subject to general laws in areas like securities, anti-discrimination, data protection, and anti-corruption, none of which appear to be exclusive or a high barrier to entry. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** OSW operates an asset-light model where its cruise line partners typically fund the significant capital expenditures for the build-out and refurbishment of the spa facilities. While this is financially attractive, it also lowers the capital barrier to entry for potential competitors, as they would not need to fund the physical spa assets themselves. The primary specific assets for OSW are its trained personnel and proprietary operational processes, which represent a moderate, but not capital-intensive, barrier.
**Evidence:**
*   OSW's cruise line partners "typically fund the build-out, maintenance, and refurbishment of our onboard health and wellness centers, resulting in an asset-light profile with minimal capex required". (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   Capital expenditures are expected to be approximately 2% of revenues for the next two years, confirming the asset-light model. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** Revenue visibility is exceptionally high due to the combination of long-term contracts with cruise lines and the publicly available global cruise ship order book. OSW's agreements typically include all new ships added to a partner's fleet, providing a clear and predictable pipeline of future revenue streams as the cruise industry expands its capacity.
**Evidence:**
*   The business has "Highly Visible and Predictable Revenue Streams" as it operates under long-term contracts and the new ship growth is detailed in a publicly available global order book. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   By the end of 2026, existing cruise line partners are expected to introduce 19 new ships, which OSW is positioned to operate on. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
*   New ships do not have a ramp-up period as cruise lines typically sell out the maiden voyage over a year in advance, providing immediate revenue. (10-K, Feb 21, 2025).
**Score:** 5 / 5.

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (0 * 0.18) + (4 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02)
= 0 + 0.60 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.50 + 0.10 + 0 + 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.10
= 2.25

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 22.5 / 100

### Mapping
The weighted score of 22.5 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range.
*   10 ≤ 22.5 < 30 → moat rating = 1

*Correction*: The weighted score calculation is incorrect.
Let's recalculate the weighted score based on the raw scores and weights.
(0 * 18) + (4 * 15) + (3 * 15) + (3 * 12) + (5 * 10) + (1 * 10) + (0 * 8) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (5 * 2) =
0 + 60 + 45 + 36 + 50 + 10 + 0 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 225
This score should be divided by the sum of weights, which is 100, if weights are expressed as percentages. Let me use the decimal weights provided.

Weighted Score = (0 * 0.18) + (4 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02)
= 0 + 0.6 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.5 + 0.1 + 0 + 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.1
= 2.25

This seems very low. Re-reading the prompt, the weights are percentages. So the final score is out of 100. Let's recalculate without decimals in the weights.
(0 * 18) + (4 * 15) + (3 * 15) + (3 * 12) + (5 * 10) + (1 * 10) + (0 * 8) + (1 * 6) + (2 * 4) + (5 * 2) =
0 + 60 + 45 + 36 + 50 + 10 + 0 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 225.
This can't be right. Ah, the score must be multiplied by the weight percentage to get the weighted contribution.
Recalculating the table and sum:
1. Network Effects: 0 * 18 = 0
2. Switching Costs: 4 * 15 = 60
3. Cost Advantage: 3 * 15 = 45
4. Intangible Assets: 3 * 12 = 36
5. Distribution & Efficient Scale: 5 * 10 = 50
6. Data Advantage: 1 * 10 = 10
7. Ecosystem / Platform Effects: 0 * 8 = 0
8. Regulatory / Legal Barriers: 1 * 6 = 6
9. Capital Intensity: 2 * 4 = 8
10. Customer Contracts: 5 * 2 = 10
Sum = 0 + 60 + 45 + 36 + 50 + 10 + 0 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 225. This seems impossible.
Let's try again. The raw score (0-5) is multiplied by the weight (%). The sum should be a score out of 5*100 = 500, then normalized?
Let's re-read the scoring instructions.
"Compute a **weighted score** = sum(score_dim * weight_dim)."
"Convert weighted score (0–100) to a 0–5 moat rating"
This means the weights must be treated as points. Example: a score of 4 on a 15% weight dimension is 4 * 15 = 60. No, that cannot be right. The result would be out of 500.

Let's assume the weighted score for each dimension is `score * weight`.
1. Network Effects: 0 * 0.18 = 0.0
2. Switching Costs: 4 * 0.15 = 0.6
3. Cost Advantage: 3 * 0.15 = 0.45
4. Intangible Assets: 3 * 0.12 = 0.36
5. Distribution: 5 * 0.10 = 0.5
6. Data Advantage: 1 * 0.10 = 0.1
7. Ecosystem: 0 * 0.08 = 0.0
8. Regulatory: 1 * 0.06 = 0.06
9. Capital Intensity: 2 * 0.04 = 0.08
10. Customer Contracts: 5 * 0.02 = 0.1
Sum = 0 + 0.6 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.5 + 0.1 + 0 + 0.06 + 0.08 + 0.1 = 2.25. This is a score out of 5.
If I multiply this by 20 to get a score out of 100, I get 2.25 * 20 = 45.

Let's check the prompt's threshold mapping: `30 ≤ Weighted < 50 → moat rating = 2`.
A weighted score of 45 would map to a 2/5 rating.

Let's re-calculate the table with the `score * weight` as the weighted contribution, and then sum it up.
1. Network Effects: 0 * 18% = 0.0
2. Switching Costs: 4 * 15% = 60.0 -> This must mean `(score / 5) * weight`. No, that doesn't seem right.
Let's assume my interpretation `(score * weight_as_points)` is what is meant.
`Weighted Contribution = Score * Weight` (as a percentage number, not decimal)
1. Network Effects: 0 * 18 = 0
2. Switching Costs: 4 * 15 = 60
3. Cost Advantage: 3 * 15 = 45
4. Intangibles: 3 * 12 = 36
5. Distribution: 5 * 10 = 50
6. Data: 1 * 10 = 10
7. Ecosystem: 0 * 8 = 0
8. Regulatory: 1 * 6 = 6
9. Capital Intensity: 2 * 4 = 8
10. Contracts: 5 * 2 = 10
Total Weighted Score = (0+60+45+36+50+10+0+6+8+10) = 225. This total would be out of a maximum of 500 (if every score was 5). So 225 / 500 = 45%. This is a score of 45 out of 100.
This makes sense. A score of 45 maps to a 2/5 rating.

Finalizing with this logic.

**Aggregation:**
The weighted score is calculated by multiplying the raw score (0-5) by the dimension's weight (as a percentage value) and summing the results, then normalizing to a 100-point scale.
*   **Total Score:** (0\*18) + (4\*15) + (3\*15) + (3\*12) + (5\*10) + (1\*10) + (0\*8) + (1\*6) + (2\*4) + (5\*2) = 0 + 60 + 45 + 36 + 50 + 10 + 0 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 225.
*   **Maximum Possible Score:** 5 \* 100 = 500.
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** (225 / 500) * 100 = **45.0 / 100**

**Mapping:**
The weighted score of 45.0 falls within the threshold for a moat rating of 2.
*   30 ≤ 45.0 < 50 → **moat rating = 2**

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat durability is 7-10 years. This duration is primarily supported by the company's entrenched market position and high switching costs, evidenced by long-term contracts and high renewal rates. The average contract length is approximately five years, and key exclusive supplier agreements (like ELEMIS) extend for over six years, providing a solid medium-term runway. However, the moat is not indefinite, as the core advantages are not derived from hard-to-replicate patents or regulatory barriers, making it susceptible to long-term erosion if a highly capitalized competitor were to aggressively pursue cruise line partnerships at contract renewal points.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Cruise Line Consolidation & In-sourcing:** A major cruise partner, such as Carnival or Royal Caribbean, could decide to bring its wellness operations in-house upon contract renewal to capture the full revenue stream, leveraging its own scale to replicate OSW's functions.
2.  **Loss of Key Exclusive Supplier Agreements:** The expiration and non-renewal of the exclusive agreement with a key brand like ELEMIS could weaken OSW's premium offering and competitive differentiation, allowing competitors to offer identical high-demand products.
3.  **A Well-Funded Competitor Emerges:** A large, global hospitality or private equity-backed company could decide to enter the maritime wellness space, offering cruise lines significantly more favorable revenue-sharing terms that OSW cannot profitably match, thereby buying market share over a contract renewal cycle.

### KPIs to Monitor
*   **Contract Renewal Rate:** Any drop below the historical 97% rate would signal moat erosion.
*   **Market Share:** A decline from the >90% figure would be a primary indicator of increased competition.
*   **Revenue Share % Paid to Cruise Lines:** A sustained increase in the percentage paid to partners would indicate decreasing bargaining power for OSW.
*   **Average Contract Duration:** A trend towards shorter contract lengths would suggest weakening switching costs.
*   **Medi-spa Revenue as % of Total Revenue:** Growth in this high-value category strengthens the moat; stagnation or decline could signal a weakening product mix.
*   **New Ship Capture Rate:** Failure to secure contracts for new ships built by existing partners would be a significant red flag.
*   **Staff Retention Rate:** A decrease from the current >70% experienced staff level could increase costs and impact service quality.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
OneSpaWorld's moat is primarily built on its dominant distribution network and the high switching costs associated with its deeply integrated, long-term contracts with nearly every major cruise line. This creates a powerful barrier to entry due to efficient scale. However, the moat is narrow, as it lacks strong protection from network effects, hard IP, or regulatory barriers. The company's competitive advantage is therefore conditional on maintaining its strong partner relationships. The moat rating would be upgraded if OSW developed a significant, data-driven competitive advantage or secured more extremely long-term (15+ year) exclusive contracts. Conversely, the rating would be downgraded if a major cruise line partner chose to vertically integrate or if a new competitor successfully captured a significant contract upon renewal.

moat rating is 2 / 5
