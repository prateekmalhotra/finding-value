**Market-Implied Assumptions**

To justify the current market price of **$121.85**, which corresponds to an Enterprise Value of approximately $7,680 million, the market must believe the company can achieve a specific combination of growth and profitability.

*   **Calculation:**
    *   Market Capitalization = $121.85/share * 47.00M shares = $5,726.95M
    *   Net Debt = $2,011.36M (Total Debt) - $58.61M (Cash) = $1,952.75M
    *   Enterprise Value (EV) = $5,726.95M + $1,952.75M = $7,679.70M

By holding the TTM operating margin (EBIT/Revenue) of **30.54%** and other key ratios constant, a reverse DCF model indicates the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 7.5%**.

Therefore, the market-implied assumption is: **To justify today's stock price, one must believe Choice Hotels can grow revenue at an average annual rate of 7.5% for the next five years while maintaining its current operating margin of ~30.5%.**

### PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)

This section builds a valuation from the ground up using realistic, evidence-based assumptions.

**Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Analyst's Base Case | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | 5.0% tapering to 3.0% | The market's 7.5% implied growth appears optimistic for a mature company. A more realistic forecast starts at 5.0%, reflecting solid brand performance, and gradually tapers to a long-term sustainable rate of 3.0%. This acknowledges market maturity and the law of large numbers. |
| **Operating Margin** | 31.0% (stable) | The TTM margin is ~30.5%. The asset-light franchise model supports high and stable margins. A forecast of 31.0% is a modest and reasonable assumption, reflecting continued operational efficiency and strong royalty fee streams without assuming major unannounced margin expansion initiatives. |
| **Tax Rate** | 24.0% | The effective tax rate has been stable around this level for several years. 24.0% is a reliable long-term assumption, consistent with the U.S. corporate tax environment. (Based on stockanalysis.com data). |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 3.5% | The TTM capex of ~9.8% is anomalously high. As an asset-light franchisor, CHH's historical capex is typically much lower (3-4% of revenue). We revert to a normalized rate of 3.5% to reflect ongoing technology/software investments and routine corporate needs, which is more representative of the business model. |
| **Change in WC as % of Revenue**| 0.5% of revenue | Working capital requirements for this business model are minimal. Modeling a small outflow of 0.5% of revenue is a standard and conservative approach for a stable, growing business. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 2.7% | TTM SBC is 2.7% of revenue ($43.44M / $1,586M). This will be held constant as a percentage of revenue and correctly treated as a real cash expense that reduces free cash flow. |
| **Net Share Count Change**| -1.5% annually | The company has a consistent history of share repurchases. A net 1.5% annual reduction in share count is a reasonable estimate of buybacks exceeding dilution from stock-based compensation. |

**Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,665.30 | $1,740.24 | $1,809.85 | $1,873.19 | $1,929.39 |
| *Growth Rate* | *5.0%* | *4.5%* | *4.0%* | *3.5%* | *3.0%* |
| EBIT (31.0% of Revenue) | $516.24 | $539.47 | $561.05 | $580.69 | $598.11 |
| *Tax (24.0%)* | ($123.90) | ($129.47) | ($134.65) | ($139.37) | ($143.55) |
| **NOPAT** | **$392.34** | **$410.00** | **$426.40** | **$441.32** | **$454.56** |
| D&A (3.1% of Revenue) | $51.62 | $53.95 | $56.11 | $58.07 | $59.81 |
| SBC (2.7% of Revenue) | ($44.96) | ($46.99) | ($48.87) | ($50.58) | ($52.09) |
| Capex (3.5% of Revenue) | ($58.29) | ($60.91) | ($63.34) | ($65.56) | ($67.53) |
| Chg. in WC (0.5% of Revenue) | ($8.33) | ($8.70) | ($9.05) | ($9.37) | ($9.65) |
| **FCFF** | **$332.38** | **$347.35** | **$361.25** | **$373.88** | **$385.10** |

**Discount Rate (WACC)**
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   *Risk-Free Rate:* 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 22, 2025)
    *   *Equity Risk Premium:* 5.0%. A standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   *Beta:* 0.97 (stockanalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025). Indicates a risk profile closely aligned with the overall market, which is suitable for a large, established hospitality company.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 0.97 * 5.0% = 9.11%*

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   *Interest Expense / Average Debt = $88.19M / (($2,011.36M + $1,887.15M)/2) = 4.53%*
    *   *After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.53% * (1 - 24.0%) = 3.44%*

*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity = $5,726.95M
    *   Market Value of Debt = $2,011.36M
    *   Total Capital = $7,738.31M
    *   *WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd) = (74.0% * 9.11%) + (26.0% * 3.44%) = 7.63%*

**Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:** A terminal growth rate of 2.5% is used, reflecting long-term sustainable economic growth and inflation expectations.
    *   *Terminal Value = (FCFF_5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)*
    *   *Terminal Value = ($385.10M * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.0763 - 0.025) = $7,700.1M*

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $598.11M + $59.81M = $657.92M
    *   Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple from Gordon Growth = $7,700.1M / $657.92M = **11.7x**
    *   **Decision:** The historical median EV/EBITDA for CHH and its high-quality, asset-light peers is in the 12x-16x range. An implied multiple of 11.7x is slightly conservative but falls within a reasonable spectrum for a mature company in a stable state. It no longer appears "excessively low" after correcting the capex assumption. Therefore, the Gordon Growth method provides an internally consistent and defensible terminal value.

**Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Present Value of FCFF:**
    *   PV = ($332.38/1.0763¹) + ($347.35/1.0763²) + ($361.25/1.0763³) + ($373.88/1.0763⁴) + ($385.10/1.0763⁵)
    *   PV = $308.81 + $298.67 + $289.16 + $278.84 + $265.94 = **$1,441.42M**
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:**
    *   PV = $7,700.1M / (1.0763⁵) = **$5,315.61M**
*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   EV = $1,441.42M + $5,315.61M = **$6,757.03M**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = $6,757.03M (Enterprise Value) - $1,952.75M (Net Debt) = **$4,804.28M**

**Per-Share Valuation**

*   **Projected Year 5 Share Count:**
    *   Current Shares = 47.00M
    *   Shares_Y5 = 47.00M * (1 - 0.015)⁵ = **43.55M**
*   **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Fair Value = $4,804.28M / 43.55M shares = **$110.32 per share**

**Valuation Range**
*   **Base Case: $110.32.** As calculated above.
*   **Low/Bear Case: $85.** Assumes a recessionary environment with revenue growth flat to negative, margin compression to 28%, and a lower 10x exit multiple.
*   **High/Bull Case: $135.** Assumes successful brand integration and market share gains, leading to 6-7% initial revenue growth, modest margin expansion to 32.5%, and a higher 13.5x exit multiple.

**Margin of Safety (MOS) Price**

Applying a 30% margin of safety to the base-case estimate provides a price at which the investment offers a significant buffer against forecasting errors or unforeseen risks.
*   **MOS Price = $110.32 * (1 - 0.30) = $77.22**

**Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** The hotel industry is highly cyclical and sensitive to economic downturns, which can reduce travel demand and negatively impact revenue and profitability.
2.  **Competition:** The lodging industry is intensely competitive, with pressure from other major hotel brands, independent hotels, and alternative lodging providers like Airbnb.
3.  **Franchisee Health:** CHH's success is dependent on the financial health and performance of its franchisees. A significant decline in franchisee profitability could lead to defaults and slower unit growth.
4.  **Interest Rate Risk:** The company carries a significant debt load, making it vulnerable to rising interest rates, which would increase interest expense and reduce cash flow.
5.  **Brand Management:** Failure to maintain the reputation and appeal of its various hotel brands could lead to a loss of market share and pricing power.

final answer is 110.32 $
