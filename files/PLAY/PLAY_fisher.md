Dave & Buster's Entertainment, Inc. (PLAY)
Analysis Date: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript (June 10, 2025)

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dave & Buster's is focused on a "back to basics" strategy, emphasizing its core offerings of food, beverages, and entertainment. The company is also expanding its store footprint, with new locations opening in the first and second quarters of 2025. This suggests a belief in the continued market potential of its existing model. However, the company also faces challenges, including weak customer traffic and a recent credit rating downgrade, which may indicate headwinds to significant sales growth.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a stated "back to basics" strategy, which may imply less of a focus on new product development and more on optimizing the current model. However, the company is investing in remodels and new games, with a capital expenditure plan of up to $220 million for fiscal 2025. This indicates a commitment to refreshing the customer experience and driving sales through existing channels.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Dave & Buster's does not disclose R&D spending as a separate line item, which is typical for the restaurant and entertainment industry. Its innovation is more focused on in-store experience, such as new games and menu items, rather than traditional R&D. The effectiveness of these efforts is reflected in sales and customer traffic, which have been weak recently.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales are generated through its venues, and its marketing efforts are focused on driving traffic to these locations. The company has a loyalty program and utilizes a mobile app and web platforms to attract and retain customers. However, recent results show declining same-store sales, which suggests the sales and marketing efforts are not "above-average" in the current environment.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the first quarter of 2025, Dave & Buster's generated a net income of $22 million on revenue of $568 million, resulting in a net profit margin of approximately 3.9%. The adjusted EBITDA margin was 24%. While the EBITDA margin is substantial, the net margin is relatively low, and has declined from the previous year.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is focused on a "back to basics" strategy which is aimed at improving store-level execution and efficiency. Additionally, the company is undertaking sale-leaseback transactions to generate cash. These actions, along with cost-saving initiatives, are intended to support margins. However, with declining sales, margin improvement remains a challenge.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**

**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no specific information available in the provided search results to definitively assess the quality of labor and personnel relations at Dave & Buster's.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is currently operating with an Interim CEO, Kevin Sheehan, who is also the Board Chair. The search for a new CEO is ongoing. This indicates a lack of stability at the highest level of leadership.
**Answer:** No

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Q1 2025 earnings call was led by the interim CEO and the CFO, Darin Harper. The involvement of the Head of Entertainment Finance, Investor Relations and Treasurer, Cory Hatton, suggests some depth. However, the lack of a permanent CEO is a significant gap in the management structure.
**Answer:** No

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed financial information in its public filings and earnings releases, including reconciliations of non-GAAP measures. This suggests a good level of transparency and control. However, without access to the full 10-Q, a complete assessment is not possible.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key aspect of the "eatertainment" industry is the ability to attract and retain customers through a compelling and differentiated experience. Dave & Buster's faces competition from a variety of other entertainment and dining options. The company's recent performance suggests it may not have a strong competitive advantage at this time. The emphasis on a "back to basics" strategy, rather than a focus on innovation, supports this conclusion.
**Answer:** No

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has reiterated its full-year guidance for certain cash flow items, but has not provided a long-range profit outlook beyond the current fiscal year. The focus on a "back to basics" strategy suggests a near-term focus on improving current operations rather than a long-term vision for growth.
**Answer:** No

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company ended the first quarter of 2025 with $12 million in cash and $411 million of availability under its revolving credit facility. The company is funding its capital expenditures through operating cash flow and sale-leaseback transactions. This suggests the company is not likely to resort to equity financing in the near future.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the Q1 2025 earnings call, the interim CEO acknowledged the company's challenges, stating that "there remains a lot of work ahead." This demonstrates a degree of transparency with investors. The company also provides detailed financial information and holds regular conference calls.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no information in the provided search results to suggest a lack of integrity on the part of Dave & Buster's management. However, without a more in-depth review of governance and related-party transactions, a definitive "Yes" is not possible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

---
**Synthesis:**
The analysis of Dave & Buster's through the lens of Philip Fisher's 15 points reveals a company facing significant headwinds. The strongest positives are its commitment to refreshing the customer experience through capital expenditures, its sufficient financial position to avoid equity dilution, and its transparent communication with investors. The most significant negatives are the lack of a permanent CEO, declining profit margins, and a "back to basics" strategy that may not be sufficient to drive long-term growth in a competitive entertainment landscape. The Fisher score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the appointment of a new CEO and the success of the "back to basics" strategy in stabilizing and then growing same-store sales. A "No" on "Products/Services with Long Runway" would flip to a "Yes" with evidence of sustained positive comparable store sales and a clear strategy for growth beyond simply optimizing the current model.

**fisher score is 4 / 15**
