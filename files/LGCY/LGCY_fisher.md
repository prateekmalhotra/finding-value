Company: Legacy Education Inc. (LGCY)
Date of Analysis: August 21, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024 (filed September 27, 2024) and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025 (filed May 15, 2025).

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Legacy Education operates in the post-secondary, career-focused education market with a focus on healthcare. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data cited in the company's 2024 10-K, employment in the healthcare industry is projected to grow 16% from 2020 to 2030, creating over 2.6 million new jobs. The company is capitalizing on this demand through organic growth and acquisitions, as evidenced by a 50.7% year-over-year revenue increase for the quarter ended March 31, 2025, which was driven by a nearly 50% increase in student enrollment. This growth includes the recent acquisition of Contra Costa Medical Career College (CCMCC) in December 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's growth strategy, outlined in its 2024 10-K, explicitly includes launching new programs, adding new branch campuses, and acquiring new institutions. The company has demonstrated a commitment to this strategy by launching new accredited programs such as an Associate Degree of Nursing in January 2024 and acquiring Contra Costa Medical Career College in December 2024. This shows a clear intent to expand beyond its current operational footprint and product lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As an educational services provider, the company's research and development efforts are focused on curriculum and new program development rather than traditional R&D. The financial statements do not disclose specific spending on these development activities. While the company has successfully launched new programs, there is no verifiable data within the SEC filings to measure the effectiveness or efficiency of these efforts relative to its size or peers.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales and marketing efforts have resulted in strong growth. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, revenues increased by 39.0% year-over-year, driven by a 49.8% increase in student enrollment to 3,245 students. This suggests a highly effective student acquisition and marketing function. Advertising costs for this period were approximately 7.5% of revenue. While specific metrics like cost-per-acquisition or win rates are not provided for peer comparison, the robust enrollment growth is a strong positive indicator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Legacy Education achieved an operating margin of 17.3% and a net margin of 13.7%. This is an improvement from the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, where the company reported a 13.5% operating margin and an 11.1% net margin. These margins indicate a profitable and scalable business model.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings discuss the components of its costs, noting that expenses are increasing to support enrollment growth. However, the MD&A section of the latest 10-Q does not specify any active initiatives aimed at improving profit margins, such as pricing actions, cost-saving programs, or efficiency improvements. The current focus appears to be on investing for growth rather than explicit margin expansion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K notes that none of its employees are part of a collective bargaining agreement. The filings provide employee counts but lack qualitative data such as turnover rates, employee satisfaction surveys, or details on benefits that would be necessary to substantiate "outstanding" labor relations. The absence of disclosed disputes does not, by itself, confirm superior relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team demonstrates stability and long tenure. LeeAnn Rohmann, the founder, has been CEO since 2010, and Brandon Pope has served as CFO since 2018. This continuity in key leadership positions suggests a stable and cohesive executive team. The filings do not indicate any executive turnover or disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K identifies three named executive officers: Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Academic Officer. For a publicly traded company with multiple college brands and campuses, this is a lean executive team. The filings do not provide details on the next layer of management or discuss succession planning, indicating potential key-person risk.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor provided an unqualified opinion on the financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024. In the quarterly report for the period ending March 31, 2025, management concluded that disclosure controls and procedures were effective. However, the company reports as a single business segment, which limits investors' ability to analyze costs and profitability at the individual college or program level.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the highly regulated for-profit education industry, strong regulatory compliance is a key indicator of quality and a competitive advantage. Legacy Education demonstrates outstanding performance on key Department of Education (ED) metrics. For its 2023 fiscal year, its schools' 90/10 revenue ratios were all safely below the 90% federal funding limit. Furthermore, the company's composite score of financial responsibility from the ED was 3.0 for fiscal year 2023, double the 1.5 required to be considered financially responsible.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management’s actions, such as investing in new programs and making acquisitions, imply a focus on long-term growth. However, the SEC filings do not contain direct statements from management about their philosophy on prioritizing long-range profits over short-term results. Such commentary is typically found in earnings call transcripts or investor presentations, which were not available for this analysis.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Following its Initial Public Offering in September 2024, the company is in a strong financial position. As of March 31, 2025, Legacy Education had $17.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and no significant debt. The company generated $4.8 million in cash from operations in the nine months prior. This strong balance sheet and positive operating cash flow should be sufficient to fund organic growth and smaller acquisitions without the need for near-term dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Assessing management's candor requires a review of communications like earnings call transcripts and shareholder letters, especially during challenging periods. As a newly public company with no available transcripts for review, there is insufficient evidence to evaluate management's communication practices under different circumstances. The SEC filings are standardized legal documents and not a useful measure of voluntary transparency.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's latest 10-K and 10-Q filings reveals no evidence of significant legal proceedings, regulatory fines, or governance-related controversies. The section on legal proceedings in the March 31, 2025 10-Q states that the company is "not currently a party to any material legal proceedings." Disclosed related-party transactions are limited to consulting fees for directors, which is not uncommon. There are no apparent red flags that would question management's integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000164117225010844/form10-q.htm) (May 15, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1836754/000149315224038926/form10-k.htm) (September 27, 2024)

**Synthesis:**
Legacy Education Inc. scores positively on several of Fisher's key points, demonstrating strong growth in a favorable market, healthy profit margins, a stable executive team, and a solid balance sheet post-IPO. Its strongest attribute is its excellent regulatory standing in a highly scrutinized industry, which provides a significant competitive advantage. The primary weaknesses identified are a lack of management depth beyond the key executives and insufficient evidence in areas like R&D effectiveness, labor relations, and management candor, the latter being a consequence of limited public disclosures as a newly public entity. The score could change significantly in the next 12-24 months based on the successful integration of the CCMCC acquisition and its impact on revenue and margins. Further, the launch and performance of the new Associate Degree in Nursing program will be a critical variable to monitor. A "No" on management depth could flip to "Yes" with the hiring and disclosure of additional senior operational leaders, while a track record of transparent investor communications through future earnings calls would be required to change the scores for candor and long-range outlook.

fisher score is 9 / 15
