### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's key segments operate in massive, growing markets. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leader in the global cloud computing market, which is projected to continue double-digit growth driven by AI and data needs. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, AWS sales grew 17% year-over-year to $30.9 billion. Its e-commerce and advertising businesses are also in expanding markets, with advertising services growing to $15.7 billion in the same period. Amazon’s continued investment in new areas like healthcare and satellite broadband (Project Kuiper) provides further long-term growth potential.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's commitment to innovation is evidenced by its significant investments in new ventures and improvements to existing services. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, the company's "Technology and infrastructure" expense was $50.2 billion. In 2024, the company invested $4.05 billion into Anthropic to advance generative AI, a key area of future growth. The company is also making long-term bets on initiatives like Project Kuiper for global broadband and expanding its healthcare services. These investments demonstrate a clear strategy to develop new revenue streams beyond its established retail and AWS businesses.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's R&D, categorized as "Technology and infrastructure," is substantial and highly effective, consistently yielding market-leading products and services. For the full year 2024, this expense was $88.5 billion, or 13.9% of net sales. This investment has maintained AWS as the dominant cloud platform and fueled the rapid growth of its high-margin advertising business. The development and integration of AI technologies across its services, from logistics to Alexa and AWS, demonstrates the effective translation of R&D spending into commercial success and operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's sales organization, particularly for AWS, is exceptionally strong, securing major contracts with large enterprises and government agencies worldwide. As of June 30, 2025, AWS had future performance obligations of approximately $195 billion, indicating a strong backlog and successful sales efforts. The retail segment's "sales" are driven more by the platform's convenience and marketing, but the third-party seller services, which grew to $40.3 billion in Q2 2025, also reflect a powerful and effective sales and support ecosystem for merchants.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000086/amzn-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000086/amzn-20250630.htm) (filed July 31, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's consolidated operating margin was 11.4% for the second quarter of 2025, a significant figure for a company with a large, lower-margin retail segment. The profitability is heavily driven by the AWS segment, which posted a 32.9% operating margin in the same quarter. While the North America and International retail segments have historically lower margins (7.5% and 4.1% respectively in Q2 2025), they are improving, and the high-margin AWS and advertising businesses create a strong consolidated profit profile. For the full year 2024, the consolidated operating margin was 10.8%.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000086/amzn-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000086/amzn-20250630.htm) (filed July 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm) (filed February 6, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through efficiency and cost control. In its retail operations, Amazon is working to lower its cost-to-serve by redesigning its fulfillment network and increasing automation. Management commentary in recent earnings calls has emphasized "fulfillment network efficiencies" and optimizing operations. The company has also demonstrated opex discipline, with general and administrative expenses decreasing as a percentage of sales. Furthermore, the continued growth of high-margin businesses like AWS and advertising naturally improves the company's overall margin profile.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000004/amzn-20241231.htm) (filed February 6, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon faces significant and persistent challenges in its labor relations, particularly within its fulfillment network. The company has been the subject of numerous media reports and regulatory scrutiny regarding warehouse working conditions, safety, and productivity pressures. It continues to face unionization efforts across the U.S. and Europe. While Amazon states it invests heavily in safety and competitive pay, the ongoing public disputes and organizing activities indicate that labor relations are not "outstanding" as per Fisher's high bar.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's executive team has demonstrated stability, particularly with the successful transition from founder Jeff Bezos to CEO Andy Jassy in 2021. The leadership team includes many long-tenured executives who have risen through the ranks, such as the CEOs of the Worldwide Amazon Stores and AWS divisions, indicating a strong internal talent pipeline. While turnover exists, as in any large corporation, the core leadership team appears stable and aligned with the company's long-term principles.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon has strong, publicly-named leaders for its primary divisions, including Andy Jassy (CEO), Matthew Garman (CEO of AWS), and Douglas Herrington (CEO Worldwide Amazon Stores). The company's "S-team," a group of senior executives from across the company, represents a broad base of leadership talent. The successful elevation of internal leaders to top roles, such as Jassy and Garman, demonstrates a commitment to cultivating management depth and effective succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large accelerated filer, Amazon is subject to rigorous accounting standards and audits. Its independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, breaking out revenues and operating income for North America, International, and AWS, which gives investors clear insight into the cost structures and profitability of its core businesses. There is no recent history of material restatements or significant control weaknesses.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's primary competitive advantage is its "flywheel," a self-reinforcing cycle of lower prices, greater selection, and convenience that attracts more customers, which in turn attracts more third-party sellers, further expanding selection. This creates powerful network effects. Furthermore, its extensive, proprietary fulfillment and logistics network provides a significant moat in e-commerce that is difficult and costly for competitors to replicate. In cloud computing, AWS benefits from a strong first-mover advantage, a vast service portfolio, and an ecosystem that creates high switching costs for customers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon has a well-documented history of prioritizing long-term growth over short-term profitability, a philosophy established by its founder. This is demonstrated by its sustained, heavy investment in capex and R&D for future growth areas like AI (Anthropic investment), Project Kuiper, and healthcare. For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2025, purchases of property and equipment were over $107 billion. Management consistently message a long-term investment philosophy in earnings calls and shareholder letters, reinforcing their willingness to sacrifice near-term profits for what they believe will be greater long-term cash flows.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's financial position is exceptionally strong, with robust operating cash flow and a large cash balance. For the trailing twelve months ended June 30, 2025, net cash provided by operating activities was $121.1 billion. The company held $93.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities as of June 30, 2025. This strong internal cash generation, coupled with access to debt markets, is more than sufficient to fund its significant capital expenditures and investments without needing to issue dilutive equity. The company also has a $10 billion share repurchase program authorized, further signaling its strong capital position.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon's management maintains a consistent and transparent communication style with investors through its quarterly earnings releases, calls, and detailed financial filings. They provide segment-level data that allows for deep analysis of the business. In periods of challenge, such as the post-pandemic slowdown and concerns about over-investment in fulfillment, management has openly addressed the issues and detailed their plans to improve efficiency and profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Amazon faces significant scrutiny from regulators globally, which challenges the "unquestionable" nature of its integrity from a governance perspective. The company is involved in numerous antitrust and consumer protection investigations by authorities in the U.S. and Europe, as described in its legal proceedings disclosures. These include claims about its use of third-party seller data and practices that allegedly stifle competition. While these are allegations and the company disputes them, the sheer volume and seriousness of these regulatory challenges prevent a clear "Yes" under Fisher's stringent criterion.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000036/amzn-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018724/000101872425000036/amzn-20250331.htm) (filed May 1, 2025)

### Synthesis
Amazon scores well on most of Fisher's points, reflecting its dominant market positions, strong financials, and long-term focus on innovation and growth. Its primary strengths lie in its vast growth runways in cloud, e-commerce, and advertising, coupled with a proven ability to execute and invest for the long term. The major detractors from a perfect score are significant and persistent issues with labor relations and regulatory scrutiny over its competitive practices. These two areas represent the most substantial risks to the business and its reputation. Over the next 12–24 months, the variables most likely to change the score would be the outcomes of major antitrust lawsuits in the U.S. and Europe and any significant changes in labor relations, such as widespread unionization. A definitive legal victory or a fundamental, verifiable improvement in employee relations could flip a "No" to a "Yes," but given the current landscape, this appears unlikely.

fisher score is 13 / 15
