Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV, August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed include 2024 annual and Q2 2025 financial results summaries and earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Anheuser-Busch InBev is pursuing growth through geographic expansion in emerging markets, particularly Asia, and diversification into the 'Beyond Beer' category, which includes non-alcoholic beverages, spirits, and hard seltzers. The Beyond Beer portfolio accounted for 2% of total revenues in 2024. The company's no-alcohol beer portfolio saw a 34% revenue increase in Q1 2025, with Corona Cero experiencing triple-digit volume growth. The company projects EBITDA growth of 4-8% for the full year 2025.

The company is also focused on innovation in its "Beyond Beer" portfolio and premiumization of its existing beer brands.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While specific R&D expenditure figures are not readily available in the provided search results, the company's focus on innovation is evident through the growth of its "Beyond Beer" and no-alcohol beer portfolios. The 34% revenue growth in the no-alcohol segment in Q1 2025 and the triple-digit volume growth of Corona Cero are indicators of successful product development. However, without specific R&D spending data and comparisons to peers, it's difficult to definitively assess the effectiveness relative to size.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a global presence with a portfolio of over 500 brands. The revenue of nearly $60 billion in 2024 is a testament to the scale and reach of its sales and distribution network. The company's focus on "focused portfolio management" and "increasing market investments" suggests a sophisticated sales and marketing apparatus. However, without specific metrics on sales force productivity, customer retention, or win rates against competitors, a definitive "Yes" is not possible.
**Answer:** No

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Anheuser-Busch InBev reported impressive gross profit margins of 55% in its 2024 fiscal year. In Q4 2024, the normalized EBITDA margin expanded by 216bps to 35.3%, and for the full year 2024, the normalized EBITDA margin expanded by 179bps to 35.1%. These are strong profitability metrics.

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's revenue growth is driven by a 3.7% increase in revenue per hectoliter in Q1 2025, indicating pricing power. The company is also focused on "premiumization" of its portfolio, which aims to increase the share of higher-margin premium and super-premium brands.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a stated philosophy of building a resilient company by retaining top talent and providing career growth opportunities. Former CEO Carlos Brito's strategy was built on the conviction that "giving employees opportunities to thrive is central to Anheuser-Busch InBev's resilience." While this indicates a positive culture, there is no recent, specific data available on employee turnover, engagement scores, or labor disputes to make a definitive judgment.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The available information does not provide sufficient detail to assess the quality of executive relations. There is no information on board stability, succession planning, or insider ownership in the provided search results.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The search results mention the CEO, Michel Doukeris, and the CFO, Fernando Tennenbaum, as hosting earnings calls. The company's global structure would suggest a deep bench of regional and brand managers, but there is no specific information available to assess the depth and experience of the broader management team.
**Answer:** No

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has achieved a perfect Piotroski Score of 9, which indicates strong financial health across multiple metrics. The company files its annual report under Form 20-F with the SEC, and the report was signed by the Global Legal Director Corporate, affirming compliance with SEC requirements. This suggests a high level of financial rigor and transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Anheuser-Busch InBev's key competitive advantages are its massive scale, extensive distribution network, and a portfolio of iconic brands with strong consumer loyalty. The company's ability to leverage these assets to enter new markets and product categories, such as the 'Beyond Beer' segment, is a key differentiator. The company's focus on a consistent set of values and principles across its global operations also contributes to its competitive strength.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategic focus is on long-term earnings growth through increasing per-barrel profitability and expanding its international operations. The company's expansion strategy, including the acquisition of SABMiller, was driven by a long-term vision of building a resilient and growing business. The company provides a medium-term EBITDA growth outlook of 4-8%, demonstrating a focus on sustainable growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio of 2.89x at the end of 2024, down from 3.38x at the end of 2023. The company also has a $2 billion share buyback program, of which $750 million was completed as of February 21, 2025. These actions, combined with strong cash flow generation, suggest that the company is not likely to need to issue equity for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company hosts regular earnings calls and webcasts to discuss its financial results. The investor relations website provides access to annual and quarterly reports, presentations, and other filings. However, without a specific instance of the company managing a significant crisis, it is difficult to fully assess its candor in times of trouble. The Bud Light controversy in the US is a recent example of a challenge, and the company's response and communication around this issue would be a key indicator, but specific details are not available in the provided search results.

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided search results to suggest any issues with management's integrity. The company is a large, publicly traded multinational that is subject to the regulations and scrutiny of multiple jurisdictions. The company's compliance with SEC filing requirements is a positive indicator. However, without a deeper dive into the company's litigation history, regulatory actions, and governance practices, a definitive "Yes" cannot be given.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**

Anheuser-Busch InBev demonstrates strengths in its long-term growth strategy, profitability, and financial management. The company is effectively pursuing growth through its "Beyond Beer" segment, premiumization, and expansion in emerging markets. Its strong profit margins and disciplined approach to cost control are also positives. The primary areas of uncertainty, and the reasons for the "No" answers, are related to a lack of specific data on R&D effectiveness, sales organization performance, labor relations, management depth, and investor communication during crises. The score could be improved in the next 12-24 months with a demonstrated recovery in US sales volumes, continued strong growth in the "Beyond Beer" and no-alcohol segments, and more transparent disclosure of key performance indicators related to the areas of uncertainty. A "No" would flip to a "Yes" on R&D, for example, with disclosure of R&D spending as a percentage of revenue and a comparison to peers. For labor relations, a third-party "best places to work" award or a publicly disclosed low employee turnover rate would be positive evidence.

**fisher score is 8 / 15**
