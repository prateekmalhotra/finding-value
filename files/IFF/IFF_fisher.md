**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**  
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF operates in the large and growing flavors, fragrances, and ingredients markets, which are tied to stable consumer staples. The company holds leadership positions across key categories including Tastes, Textures, Scents, and Nutrition. Growth is supported by consumer trends toward health, wellness, and natural ingredients; for example, the Saudi Arabian flavors and fragrances market is projected to grow at a 3.38% CAGR through 2030, driven by these trends. Management's 2025 outlook projects 1% to 4% comparable currency-neutral growth, indicating confidence in continued market demand.  
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF states it invests "substantial resources in the research and development of new and innovative molecules, compounds, formulations and technologies." For 2025, the company plans to invest approximately 6% of sales in Capex, focusing on capacity expansion in Health & Biosciences and Scent, and strengthening R&D. The company continues to launch new products, such as the low nitrite excipient solutions and ultrapure alginate technologies showcased for the Pharma Solutions division in September 2024. This demonstrates a clear commitment to reinvestment in innovation for future growth.  
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF invested approximately 5.8% of its $11.48 billion in 2024 sales into R&D, which is a substantial commitment. This investment is supported by a global team of approximately 3,400 people in R&D activities. As of December 31, 2024, the company held 894 granted U.S. patents and had 458 pending U.S. patent applications, indicating a productive research pipeline. While direct peer comparisons are difficult, IFF's investment level and patent portfolio appear competitive for its industry.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF serves a diverse customer base, with its 25 largest customers accounting for approximately 33% of sales in 2024, and no single customer representing 10% or more. The company emphasizes that a key factor for success is its inclusion on the "core supplier lists" of a large majority of its global and strategic customers, which gives it priority for new business. While specific sales metrics like win rates are not disclosed, maintaining preferred supplier status with major consumer product companies suggests an effective sales and service organization.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal year 2024, IFF reported a gross margin of 35.9% and an operating margin of 6.7%. These margins are significantly lower than its primary competitors. For the same period, Givaudan reported a gross margin of 44.1% and an operating margin of 18.8%, while Symrise reported a gross margin of 39.3% and an EBITDA margin of 20.7%. IFF's profitability is demonstrably below that of its direct, large-scale peers.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.givaudan.com/media/media-releases/2025/2024-full-year-results](https://www.givaudan.com/media/media-releases/2025/2024-full-year-results) (January 24, 2025), [https://www.symrise.com/newsroom/article/symrise-achieves-significant-sales-growth-in-2024-with-a-strong-increase-in-profitability/](https://www.symrise.com/newsroom/article/symrise-achieves-significant-sales-growth-in-2024-with-a-strong-increase-in-profitability/) (January 30, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively addressing its subpar margins through multiple initiatives. The company launched the "IFF Productivity Program" in late 2024, which involves ceasing operations in select manufacturing plants and reducing headcount to optimize its footprint. IFF is also executing a significant portfolio optimization strategy, divesting its Pharma Solutions and Cosmetic Ingredients businesses to focus on core, higher-margin areas. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management highlighted these efforts, noting a 170 basis point margin improvement in the Food Ingredients business as a result of an operational improvement plan.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4706501-international-flavors-and-fragrances-inc-iff-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (August 6, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company reports a culture focused on inclusion and belonging, citing that in 2024 employee sentiment on inclusion increased to 82% from 80% in 2023. IFF has also received external recognition for its workplace environment from organizations like EDGE and DisabilityIN. A search for negative labor events revealed no major disputes or strikes specifically involving IFF in the 2024-2025 period. The absence of public disputes, coupled with positive internal metrics and external awards, suggests good personnel relations.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.intellizence.com/latest-layoffs-downsizing-hiring-freezes/](https://www.intellizence.com/latest-layoffs-downsizing-hiring-freezes/) (August 19, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF has experienced significant executive turnover recently. A new CEO, J. Erik Fyrwald, was appointed in February 2024. Additionally, a new CFO, Michael DeVeau, was appointed in January 2025, and several new division presidents were named throughout 2024 and early 2025. While this new team may be a positive long-term, such widespread and recent changes at the highest levels indicate a period of instability, not the outstanding and settled executive relations Fisher valued.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IFF's Executive Leadership Team, as listed in its 2024 10-K, comprises 13 individuals beyond the CEO. This team includes presidents for each of its key business units (Taste, Food Ingredients, Health & Biosciences, Scent, and Pharma Solutions), as well as heads of major functions like Global Operations, People & Culture, and R&D. The new executives appointed in 2024 and 2025 bring extensive experience from other major corporations such as Syngenta, Kellogg, and ADM, suggesting a deep and capable leadership bench is in place.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 10-K, IFF's management concluded that "internal control over financial reporting was effective" as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was audited by their independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal controls. Furthermore, the 10-K reports no unresolved staff comments from the SEC and no disagreements with its accountants, indicating strong and transparent accounting practices.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the flavors and fragrances industry is the proprietary nature of formulas and the ability to co-develop solutions with customers, creating high switching costs. IFF excels here by maintaining "core list" status with major customers and protecting its formulas as trade secrets. Another crucial factor is innovation in novel ingredients and delivery systems, which IFF supports with a large R&D team and a significant patent portfolio. The company's global manufacturing and regulatory capabilities are also essential for serving multinational clients, representing another barrier to entry and a mark of an outstanding competitor.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent strategic actions demonstrate a clear long-range focus. In February 2024, IFF's board reduced its dividend by approximately 50% "to enable faster deleveraging of the balance sheet and provide improved financial flexibility," sacrificing immediate shareholder returns for long-term financial health. The company is also undertaking a multi-year productivity program and divesting its large Pharma Solutions division, both of which incur short-term costs and disruption with the goal of creating a more profitable, focused enterprise in the long run. These are significant, difficult decisions that prioritize future stability over short-term results.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a clear strategy to fund its operations and deleverage its balance sheet without issuing equity. As of December 31, 2024, IFF had $8.977 billion in total debt. Management stated its capital allocation strategy is "primarily focused on debt repayment," funded by operating cash flow ($1.070 billion in 2024) and proceeds from divestitures. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, management confirmed the success of this strategy, noting that proceeds from completed divestitures helped reduce leverage to 2.5x net debt to credit adjusted EBITDA, achieving their target ahead of schedule.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4706501-international-flavors-and-fragrances-inc-iff-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (August 6, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor. The company's 2024 10-K openly discusses significant challenges, including the large goodwill impairment charge in its Nourish segment and the ongoing antitrust investigations. The August 6, 2025, earnings call transcript shows management speaking directly about both successes (deleveraging ahead of schedule) and areas needing work ("We will continue to drive improvement in food ingredients as we move through 2025 and into 2026"). This balanced communication in public forums indicates transparency with investors.  
**Answer:** Yes  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4706501-international-flavors-and-fragrances-inc-iff-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript) (August 6, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's integrity is currently questionable due to significant regulatory issues. As disclosed in its 2024 10-K, IFF is subject to "antitrust and competition investigations in the United States and Europe, as well as class action lawsuits." The filing states the company is "unable to predict or determine the scope, duration, or outcome of these investigations and lawsuits." The existence of such wide-ranging investigations into the company's competitive practices prevents an assessment of unquestionable integrity.  
**Answer:** No  
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/51253/000005125325000013/iff-20241231.htm) (February 28, 2025)

---
**Synthesis**

IFF scores positively on its long-term strategic actions, R&D commitment, and operational foundation. The company operates in resilient markets and possesses key competitive advantages in its industry, such as deep customer integration and a strong innovation pipeline. Management is taking decisive, albeit painful, steps—such as divesting major business lines and cutting its dividend—to rectify a highly leveraged balance sheet and refocus the portfolio, demonstrating a clear long-range outlook. However, the analysis reveals three significant weaknesses according to Fisher's principles: profit margins that lag key competitors, recent instability across the executive team, and, most critically, questionable integrity due to ongoing antitrust investigations.

The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables. First, the success of the portfolio optimization and productivity programs will be critical; evidence of a sustained improvement in gross and operating margins toward peer levels would flip "Worthwhile Profit Margins" (Point 5) to "Yes." Second, the resolution of the antitrust investigations is paramount; a favorable outcome without significant fines or operational restrictions would be necessary to change the "No" on "Unquestionable Integrity" (Point 15). Finally, a period of stability within the new executive team, demonstrating effective execution of the turnaround strategy, could eventually flip "Executive Relations" (Point 8) to "Yes."

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
