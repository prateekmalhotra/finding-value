Interactive Brokers Group, Inc. (IBKR), August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K, Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Interactive Brokers operates a global electronic brokerage platform with a broad and expanding product suite, indicating significant growth potential. The company consistently attracts new customers, growing its accounts by 30% year-over-year to 3.3 million in 2024, with over 85% of new customers coming from outside the U.S.. This geographic diversification, with customers in over 200 countries, provides a long runway for growth in developing and established markets. Offerings like fractional share trading in U.S. and European stocks, cryptocurrency trading, and access to over 160 global markets cater to a wide range of investors and reduce reliance on any single market or product.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IBKR's history is rooted in technology and continuous development, a focus that remains central to its strategy. The 2024 10-K highlights a suite of recently developed and enhanced offerings, including the new IBKR Desktop platform, the AI-powered GlobalAnalyst tool for discovering undervalued stocks, and expanded overnight trading hours for U.S. stocks and ETFs. The company's core philosophy is to automate every feasible aspect of the brokerage business, from client onboarding to risk management, and to continually refine its proprietary software in-house. This commitment to rapid, internal development allows IBKR to adapt to market changes and launch new features, such as AI News Summaries and enhanced advisor tools, to attract new customer segments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Interactive Brokers does not report R&D as a distinct line item, as development costs are primarily embedded in employee compensation. However, the output and effectiveness of its development efforts are evident in its highly automated, low-cost business model. The company's proprietary, integrated trading system is a key competitive advantage, allowing it to operate with a pretax profit margin of 71%. Unlike competitors who often rely on third-party vendors or legacy systems from acquisitions, IBKR has developed virtually all its software internally, enabling rapid deployment of new features and maintaining one of the lowest cost structures in the industry. The effectiveness is demonstrated by its ability to support 3.3 million clients across 160 markets on a single, unified platform.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IBKR does not have a traditional sales organization; its platform and pricing model are its primary sales tools. The company attracts sophisticated and active investors through low costs, broad market access, and superior technology, leading to strong organic growth primarily through word-of-mouth and its "Refer a Friend" program. This "sales-force-free" model is highly effective, evidenced by a 30% year-over-year growth in total accounts in 2024. The efficiency of this approach is reflected in its high profit margins, as it avoids the high costs associated with a traditional sales force.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has exceptionally high profit margins. For the full year ended December 31, 2024, Interactive Brokers reported income before income taxes of $3.7 billion on total net revenues of $5.2 billion, yielding a pretax profit margin of 71%. This is a result of its highly automated business model, which minimizes human intervention and keeps operating costs low. While direct comparisons can be complex due to differing business models, IBKR's profitability is robust within the financial sector. For context, The Charles Schwab Corporation reported a net profit margin of 33.7% for the trailing twelve months as of August 2025.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Interactive Brokers' core strategy is built on automation to maintain and improve profit margins. The company continuously enhances its proprietary software to automate functions across the entire trade lifecycle, including account opening, order routing, risk management, and compliance. This focus on technology minimizes the need for manual processing, creating significant operating leverage as the business scales. By developing its technology in-house, IBKR avoids costly vendor contracts and can rapidly deploy cost-saving enhancements. This operational efficiency is the primary driver of its consistent 71% pretax margin, even as it grows its customer base and transaction volumes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company reports a focus on attracting, developing, and retaining employees. Its 2024 10-K filing notes a 76% participation rate in an employee experience survey, which indicated "high engagement and confidence from our employees in our business." In response to the survey, the company is taking actions to enhance leadership communication and career development opportunities. They offer industry-leading benefits, including fully funded healthcare premiums for U.S. employees, and foster connection through a formal Mentorship Program. As of December 31, 2024, the company had 2,998 employees globally.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Executive relations appear stable and aligned with shareholder interests, dominated by the company's founder and chairman, Thomas Peterffy. Mr. Peterffy and his affiliates control approximately 74.2% of the combined voting power of the company's stock, ensuring long-term strategic alignment and stability. The 10-K notes this control structure allows Mr. Peterffy to elect all members of the Board of Directors and control management and affairs. This high level of insider control creates a strong, unified strategic direction, though it also concentrates power.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the Chairman, Thomas Peterffy, has immense influence, the company has a broader executive team managing operations. The 10-K lists several key executives beyond the Chairman, including a Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and Chief Information Security Officer, who oversee critical functions. Earnings call transcripts feature participation from the CEO and CFO, who speak to the company's operational and financial details, demonstrating a layer of management beyond the founder. The company's global presence, with offices and regulated subsidiaries in 15 countries, necessitates a distributed management structure to handle regional operations and compliance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IBKR/transcripts/']

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** IBKR's accounting and controls appear robust, leveraging the same automation that drives the rest of its business. The 2024 10-K includes an unqualified opinion from its independent auditor, which also attests to the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company emphasizes its real-time, automated risk management systems, which continuously calculate margin requirements for every customer account to prevent losses. Its clearing and accounting systems are highly automated, providing real-time data feeds that allow for the production of daily financial statements, demonstrating a high degree of financial control and analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's key competitive advantage is its proprietary, unified, and highly automated technology platform, built and refined over four decades. Unlike many competitors that grow through acquisition and must integrate disparate legacy systems, IBKR built its system from the ground up. This allows for seamless trading of multiple asset classes in multiple currencies across 160 markets from a single account. This technological architecture is difficult to replicate and results in significant competitive advantages in cost, execution speed (via IB SmartRouting), and the ability to rapidly innovate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently prioritizes long-term technological investment over short-term revenue maximization. The business strategy, as detailed in the 10-K, is centered on the continuous development of its automated platform to attract sophisticated clients through superior features and lower costs, rather than through large marketing expenditures. Commentary from the Q2 2025 earnings call reinforces this, with management focusing on account growth, the development of new tools, and maintaining a strong capital base. This indicates a clear preference for reinvesting in the platform's capabilities to build a durable, long-term competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IBKR/transcripts/2025/2/']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, mitigating the need for dilutive equity financing for growth. As of December 31, 2024, the operating subsidiaries had $12.4 billion in excess regulatory capital, demonstrating significant financial cushion. The business generates substantial cash flow, and its capital-light, technology-driven model does not require large capital outlays for expansion. While the company does issue shares, these are primarily related to a long-standing agreement to purchase membership interests from its holding company, IBG LLC, and for employee incentive plans, not for funding operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management, particularly founder Thomas Peterffy, has a reputation for being direct and candid. The earnings call transcripts, such as the one for Q2 2025, show executives providing detailed, unscripted answers to analyst questions on topics ranging from competitive pressures to operational metrics. This transparency provides investors with a clear view of management's thinking on the state of the business and the challenges it faces. The 10-K itself contains a thorough discussion of a wide array of risk factors, from competitive threats to technology failures, indicating a willingness to disclose potential issues.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm', 'https://discountingcashflows.com/company/IBKR/transcripts/2025/2/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company operates in a highly regulated industry and maintains a comprehensive compliance framework built into its automated systems. The "Legal Proceedings and Regulatory Matters" section of the 2024 10-K discloses that the company, like other brokerage firms, is subject to periodic regulatory inquiries, some of which can lead to fines. It notes that in the current climate, it expects to pay significant fines on an ongoing basis. While being subject to regulatory actions is common in the industry, this indicates that the firm's operations are not entirely without issue. Therefore, integrity cannot be deemed "unquestionable."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1381197/000138119725000036/ibkr-20241231x10k.htm']

---
**Synthesis**
Interactive Brokers scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong foundation in proprietary technology, a long-term strategic outlook, and a robust financial position. The company's primary strengths are its exceptional, technology-driven profit margins, a clear runway for growth through global expansion and new product development, and a stable, founder-led management team with significant insider ownership. The business model, which uses its platform as the main driver of organic growth, is highly efficient and scalable. The only negative score relates to the "unquestionable integrity" point, a high bar for any firm in the heavily regulated financial services industry where regulatory inquiries and fines are a recurring feature. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on the firm's ability to maintain its technological edge against competitors and navigate the complex global regulatory landscape without any material violations. A sustained period without significant regulatory penalties would be the key evidence needed to flip the "No" to a "Yes".

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
