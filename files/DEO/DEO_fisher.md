### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**

**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo is a global leader in beverage alcohol, with a portfolio of over 200 brands sold in more than 180 countries. The company is strategically focused on the premium and above spirits segments, which are growing globally. Diageo's tequila brands, particularly Don Julio, are experiencing strong growth, with organic net sales up 18% in fiscal 2025. The company is also seeing strong performance from its Guinness brand, with double-digit growth in Europe. The company is actively working to expand its brands into new markets and demographics, such as the "A Lovely Day" campaign for Guinness targeting younger drinkers in the US.

**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**

**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo has a stated "Growth Ambition" to be one of the best-performing consumer products companies in the world. This includes a focus on innovation and developing new products. The 2025 Annual Report highlights the launch of Don Julio Rosado and line extensions for other key brands. The company also invests in marketing campaigns to reach new consumers and expand existing brands, such as the Johnnie Walker "The Sweeter Side of Johnnie Walker Black Label" campaign. The company is also willing to divest underperforming brands to focus on growth areas.

**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo's R&D spending is not explicitly broken out in its financial statements, as it is integrated into its marketing and innovation functions. However, the company's focus on "premiumisation" and new product development, such as the successful launch of new variants of its key brands, suggests an effective innovation pipeline. The company's ability to identify and acquire high-growth brands like Casamigos and Aviation Gin also demonstrates a forward-looking approach to portfolio development. The 2025 annual report does not provide specific metrics on R&D effectiveness like success rates of new product launches.

**Answer:** No

**Citations:**
*   No specific evidence found in the 2025 Annual Report to definitively answer "Yes".

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**

**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo's global presence in over 180 countries and its portfolio of iconic brands suggest a robust sales and distribution network. The company's ability to gain market share in both spirits and total beverage alcohol in Europe during fiscal 2025, a competitive market, points to an effective sales organization. Diageo is also focused on leveraging technology and data to improve its sales execution. The company's "Spirit of Progress" plan includes initiatives to enhance its relationships with distributors and customers. However, the 2025 annual report lacks specific data on sales force productivity, retention, or win rates.

**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2025, Diageo reported an operating profit of $4,335 million on net sales of $20,245 million, resulting in an operating margin of 21.4%. This is a strong margin for a consumer goods company. The company's focus on premium and super-premium products, which command higher prices and margins, contributes to its profitability. While operating profit declined from the previous year, the company is still highly profitable.

**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo is focused on several initiatives to support its margins. The company is actively managing its product mix, focusing on higher-margin premium and super-premium brands. The company has also been implementing price increases to offset inflationary pressures. The 2025 preliminary results mention "positive price/mix of 0.8%". Additionally, Diageo has ongoing productivity and cost-saving programs to improve operational efficiency. At a recent investor event, the CFO discussed "trade spend optimization" and linking incentives to performance.

**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Diageo 2025 Annual Report emphasizes the importance of its people and culture, highlighting its commitment to inclusion and diversity. The report mentions that the company has over 29,000 employees. While the report does not provide specific metrics on employee turnover or engagement, it does outline the company's commitment to creating a safe and inclusive work environment. Without more data, it is difficult to definitively assess the quality of labor relations.

**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2025 Annual Report lists the members of the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee. There has been a recent change in leadership, with Debra Crew taking over as CEO. The transition appears to have been orderly. The executive team has a mix of long-tenured Diageo employees and external hires, which can provide a balance of experience and fresh perspectives. There are no public reports of significant executive infighting or departures.

**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**

**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2025 Annual Report provides information on the Executive Committee, which includes the CEO, CFO, and presidents of the various regions. The company has a clear management structure with experienced leaders in key roles. The recent appointment of Nik Jhangiani as the permanent CFO after he served as interim CEO suggests a degree of management depth and succession planning. The company also highlights its commitment to developing its people, which should contribute to a strong pipeline of future leaders.

**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly listed company on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges, Diageo is subject to stringent accounting and reporting standards. The 2025 Annual Report includes a detailed breakdown of its financial performance, including a summary financial review and a group financial review. The report is audited by an independent accounting firm. There have been no recent reports of major accounting scandals or restatements.

**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the beverage alcohol industry, brand recognition and distribution are key competitive advantages. Diageo's portfolio of iconic brands, including Johnnie Walker, Guinness, and Tanqueray, gives it a significant edge. The company's global distribution network allows it to reach consumers in over 180 countries. Diageo's focus on "premiumisation" aligns with the consumer trend of drinking less but better-quality alcohol. The company's ability to innovate and create new products that capture the interest of consumers is also a key differentiator.

**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo's "Growth Ambition" and its "Spirit of Progress" plan suggest a long-term focus. The company is investing in its brands and its supply chain to support long-term growth. The decision to keep the dividend flat in a challenging year suggests a prudent approach to capital allocation and a focus on long-term stability. The company is also investing in sustainability and responsible drinking initiatives, which may not have an immediate payoff but are important for the long-term health of the business.

**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In fiscal 2025, Diageo generated $4,297 million in net cash from operating activities and $2,748 million in free cash flow. The company has a strong balance sheet and access to capital markets. While the company does have debt, its cash flow is more than sufficient to cover its interest payments and dividends. The company has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which suggests that it is not in need of dilutive equity financing.

**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the 2025 preliminary results announcement, the former Interim CEO acknowledged a "need to drive future growth opportunities and focus on what we can control in the face of industry-wide pressures." This suggests a willingness to be transparent with investors about the challenges the company is facing. Diageo regularly hosts investor events and provides detailed financial reporting. The company's investor relations website provides a wealth of information for investors.

**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Diageo has a code of conduct and a commitment to "doing business the right way." The 2025 Annual Report includes a section on "Business integrity and human rights."

**Synthesis:**

Diageo scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its strong brand portfolio, global reach, and financial strength. The company's focus on premium and super-premium spirits provides a long runway for growth, and its commitment to innovation and brand development should help it to maintain its competitive advantage. The two "No" answers relate to a lack of specific disclosures on R&D effectiveness and labor relations. To turn these into "Yes" answers, Diageo would need to provide more quantitative data on the success of its new product launches and metrics on employee satisfaction and turnover. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to navigate the challenging macroeconomic environment and the success of its new leadership team in driving growth.
