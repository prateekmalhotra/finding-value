### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Churchill Downs operates across three segments with distinct growth profiles: Live and Historical Racing, TwinSpires (online wagering), and Gaming. The company is expanding its historical racing machine (HRM) footprint into new states like Virginia and Louisiana, which is a key growth driver. The TwinSpires segment, while facing a competitive online sports betting market, continues to grow its horse racing wagering business. The iconic Kentucky Derby and related events provide a consistent and growing source of high-margin revenue. The company's expansion strategy, including the acquisition of properties and development of new entertainment venues, provides a clear path for future sales growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a clear track record of reinvesting in the business through capital expenditures and acquisitions. The company has several large capital projects underway, including the development of new gaming properties and the renovation of existing facilities. For instance, the company has been investing heavily in expanding its HRM operations and redeveloping its racetrack properties to include more entertainment options. The recent acquisition of Ellis Park and the development of a new historical racing facility in Kentucky are prime examples of this commitment.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Churchill Downs does not have a traditional R&D department in the way a technology or pharmaceutical company would. Its innovation is more focused on new property development, expansion of gaming offerings, and technological improvements to its online wagering platforms. The company's "R&D" is effectively its capital project pipeline. Given the successful rollout of new properties and the continued growth of the TwinSpires platform, these efforts appear effective. However, without specific R&D metrics, a definitive "Yes" is not possible.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales and marketing efforts are multifaceted, focusing on driving attendance at its live events, increasing wagering on its TwinSpires platform, and attracting customers to its gaming venues. The continued growth in Kentucky Derby attendance and wagering, as well as the successful launch of new gaming properties, suggest an effective sales and marketing function. The company's ability to cross-promote its various offerings is a key strength. However, specific metrics on the sales organization's effectiveness are not publicly disclosed.

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Churchill Downs has historically maintained strong profit margins. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a net income margin of 16.5%. The company's iconic and high-margin events like the Kentucky Derby contribute significantly to its profitability. The expanding HRM business also carries attractive margins. While margins can fluctuate due to the timing of major events and acquisitions, they remain healthy.

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on several initiatives to improve margins. These include a disciplined approach to cost management, the expansion of higher-margin gaming operations, and the use of technology to improve efficiency. The company is also focused on optimizing its pricing and promotional strategies to maximize profitability. For example, the recent strategic decision to exit the online sports and casino business, which was a highly competitive and low-margin segment, demonstrates a commitment to disciplined capital allocation and margin improvement.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Churchill Downs employs a large number of unionized employees, particularly at its racetracks. While the company states in its 10-K that it believes its relations with its employees are good, there have been occasional labor disputes. For example, unionized employees at the company's Fair Grounds Race Course & Slots in New Orleans have held protests over contract negotiations in the past. Without more detailed public information on employee turnover and satisfaction, it is difficult to definitively assess the quality of labor relations.

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's ownership of the iconic Kentucky Derby is a significant competitive advantage that cannot be replicated.

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has consistently demonstrated a willingness to make long-term investments, even if they have a near-term impact on profitability.

The company has a revolving credit facility that provides it with ample liquidity to fund its capital expenditure program and pursue strategic acquisitions. While the company does have a significant amount of debt, its leverage ratios are manageable, and it has a long track record of successfully managing its debt.

Synthesis:
Churchill Downs scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its primary strengths being its iconic and irreplaceable assets, its disciplined approach to capital allocation, and its experienced and stable management team. The company has multiple avenues for growth, particularly through the expansion of its historical racing machine business and the continued development of its entertainment venues. The "No" answers are primarily due to a lack of specific public disclosures rather than any identified weakness. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the successful execution of its large capital projects and the continued growth of its historical racing machine business. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" on "Labor & Personnel Relations" with more positive disclosures around employee satisfaction and relations.

fisher score is 12 / 15
