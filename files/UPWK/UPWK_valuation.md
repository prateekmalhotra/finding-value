### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale and Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Year 1)** | 11.0% | Based on the midpoint of management's 2025 revenue guidance of $770 million, which implies approximately 11% YoY growth from 2024. |
| **Revenue Growth (Years 2-5)** | 8.0%, 7.0%, 6.0%, 5.0% | A declining growth rate is assumed, reflecting a maturing market and the law of large numbers. This is a conservative estimate based on historical growth rates. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin)** | 16.11% | Starting with the TTM EBIT margin of 16.11% and holding it constant, as management's guidance is for adjusted EBITDA margin, and there's no specific guidance on GAAP operating margin expansion. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 21% | Based on the average effective tax rate over the last 3 years, normalized for any significant one-off events. |
| **Capex as a % of Revenue** | 1.0% | Based on the 3-year average capex as a percentage of revenue. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data) |
| **Change in Working Capital as a % of Revenue** | 1.0% | Based on the 3-year average change in working capital as a percentage of revenue. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data) |
| **SBC as a % of Revenue** | 7.8% | Based on the TTM SBC as a percentage of revenue. (Calculated from StockAnalysis.com data) |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding** | 144.0 million | Latest reported diluted weighted-average shares. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers.

**FCFF Formula:**
EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions USD) | Year 1 (2026) | Year 2 (2027) | Year 3 (2028) | Year 4 (2029) | Year 5 (2030) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $857.9 | $926.5 | $991.4 | $1,050.9 | $1,103.4 |
| EBIT (16.11% of Revenue) | $138.2 | $149.2 | $159.7 | $169.3 | $177.8 |
| EBIT \* (1 - Tax Rate) | $109.2 | $117.9 | $126.2 | $133.7 | $140.5 |
| \+ D&A | $8.5 | $9.3 | $9.9 | $10.5 | $11.0 |

| **FCFF** | **$23.6** | **$26.3** | **$29.0** | **$31.2** | **$33.4** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale and Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | 10-Year US Treasury Yield (TradingEconomics.com, Aug 20, 2025). |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium. |
| Beta | 1.45 | 5-year monthly beta from Yahoo Finance. This reflects the company's higher-than-market volatility. |
| *Cost of Equity* | *11.54%* | *4.29% + 1.45 \* 5.0%* |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Cost of Debt | 0.75% | Interest Expense / Total Debt. ($2.8M / $370.9M) |
| After-Tax Cost of Debt | 0.59% | 0.75% \* (1 - 21%) |
| **WACC** | | |
| Market Cap (Equity Value) | $2,046.2M | 144.0M shares \* $14.21/share (Aug 20, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $370.9M | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025) |
| Total Capital | $2,417.1M | |
| Weight of Equity | 84.6% | $2,046.2M / $2,417.1M |
| Weight of Debt | 15.4% | $370.9M / $2,417.1M |
| **WACC** | **9.83%** | **(84.6% \* 11.54%) + (15.4% \* 0.59%)** |

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Assumed long-run inflation expectation).
    *   **Terminal Value:** (Year 5 FCFF \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = ($33.4M \* 1.025) / (9.83% - 2.5%) = **$466.8M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $188.8M (EBIT + D&A)
    *   **Historical Median EV/EBITDA Multiple:** A 5-10 year historical median multiple is difficult to ascertain for a relatively new public company. However, a conservative multiple of 10x is assumed.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple):** $188.8M \* 10 = **$1,888M**
*   There is a significant discrepancy between the two methods, so the **lower Gordon Growth terminal value of $466.8M will be used.**

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| PV of Explicit Period FCFF | $112.5M |
| PV of Terminal Value | $292.8M |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$405.3M** |
| \- Total Debt | ($370.9M) |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$2.26** |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$1.50** |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$3.50** |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$1.58** |

*   **Base Case:** $325.5M / 144.0M shares = **$2.26/share**
*   **Low/Bear Case:** Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 5-7% in the initial years), margin compression, and a higher WACC, resulting in a lower per-share value.
*   **High/Bull Case:** Assumes higher revenue growth (e.g., 12-15% in the initial years), margin expansion closer to management's 35% adjusted EBITDA target, and a lower WACC, resulting in a higher per-share value.
