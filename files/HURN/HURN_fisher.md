### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Huron consistently invests in new service offerings and strategic acquisitions to expand its capabilities. The company's Q2 2025 10-Q filing details investments in technology and analytics to enhance service delivery.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

**Answer:** No

**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the consulting industry, brand reputation and client relationships are key differentiators.

Synthesis:
Huron Consulting Group appears to be a strong performer based on Fisher's 15 points, with many positive indicators. The company's strengths lie in its focus on growing markets, consistent investment in new services, healthy financials, and experienced management team. The primary areas for improvement would be in providing more transparency around R&D effectiveness and labor relations. Over the next 12-24 months, the company's ability to successfully integrate acquisitions and capitalize on the digital transformation in its key markets will be the most significant factors influencing its score. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" for R&D effectiveness if the company were to begin disclosing metrics on its innovation investments and their returns. Similarly, more detailed disclosures on employee turnover and engagement could turn the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes".

fisher score is 13 / 15
