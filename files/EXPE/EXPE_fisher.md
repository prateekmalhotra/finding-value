Expedia's 2024 gross bookings were $110.9 billion, representing a single-digit percentage of the total market, indicating a significant opportunity for growth. The company's B2B segment, which provides travel technology and supply to a range of partners, is a key growth driver, with revenue increasing 21% in 2024.

The company has migrated its core B2C brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo) onto a single front-end stack, which increases feature release velocity. The launch of the "One Key" unified loyalty program in the U.S. and U.K. is a major initiative to drive customer retention and cross-brand synergies. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, CEO Ariane Gorin emphasized the focus on "driving product innovation" and leveraging AI to improve the customer experience.

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Expedia's operating margin was 9.6%, and its net margin was 9.0%. The company's Adjusted EBITDA margin was 21.4%. While these margins are healthy, they are subject to competitive pressure and investments in marketing and technology.

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been some executive turnover, including the departure of the Vice Chairman in 2024 and a new CEO, Ariane Gorin, taking the helm in February 2024. However, the company has a seasoned leadership team, and the transition appears to have been orderly. Chairman and Senior Executive Barry Diller continues to provide long-term vision and stability.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Beyond the CEO and Chairman, Expedia has a team of experienced executives leading its various brands and functions. The company has recently appointed general managers for each of its core consumer brands to improve accountability and leverage the unified tech platform. The company's ability to manage a complex global business with a portfolio of brands suggests a deep bench of management talent.

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, publicly-traded company, Expedia is subject to Sarbanes-Oxley and has an independent auditor, Ernst & Young, LLP, who has audited the effectiveness of the company's internal controls over financial reporting. The 2024 10-K includes a statement from management that their disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The company provides detailed segment reporting, which allows for a good level of cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia's key competitive advantages in the online travel industry include its two-sided network of travelers and suppliers, its portfolio of well-recognized brands, and its proprietary technology platform. The company's ability to offer a wide range of travel products (lodging, air, car, etc.) and its global reach are significant differentiators. The company's B2B business, which provides technology and supply to other travel companies, is a unique and valuable asset.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Expedia's multi-year platform migration and investment in the "One Key" loyalty program are evidence of a long-term strategic focus. These initiatives have required significant upfront investment with the expectation of long-term benefits in customer retention and efficiency. Management's commentary in earnings calls frequently emphasizes long-term growth and market share gains over short-term profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Expedia had $4.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and a $2.5 billion revolving credit facility that was largely untapped. The company generated $3.1 billion in cash from operations in 2024. Expedia also has a $5 billion share repurchase program, demonstrating a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1324424/000132442425000008/expe-20241231.htm [February 6, 2025]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent earnings call transcripts indicates that management is generally candid with investors. For example, in the Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed the challenges and complexities of the "One Key" rollout and the impact on financial results. The company provides detailed financial reporting and hosts regular investor calls and conferences.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://discountingcashflows.com/company/EXPE/transcripts/ [August 7, 2025]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics for directors and senior financial officers. While the company is involved in various legal proceedings, including some related to occupancy taxes and competition matters, these are common for a company of its size and in its industry. There is no evidence of significant governance red flags or a pattern of unethical behavior. The 2021 settlement of stockholder litigation related to the Liberty Expedia Transaction did result in some governance changes.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis: Expedia Group scores well on Fisher's checklist, reflecting its strong market position, commitment to innovation, and solid financial health. The company's long-term investments in its technology platform and unified loyalty program are key positives, though the execution of these initiatives will be critical to watch. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the "One Key" loyalty program in driving customer retention and cross-selling, the continued growth of the high-margin B2B segment, and the company's ability to maintain its market share in an intensely competitive environment. Any "No" answers would likely be triggered by a failure to execute on these strategic initiatives, a significant deterioration in profit margins due to competitive pressures, or a major setback in their international expansion plans.

fisher score is 15 / 15
