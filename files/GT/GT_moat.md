| **Total** | **100%** | | **16.8** |

### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning:** The tire industry is not characterized by network effects. Customers do not derive more value from a tire because others are using the same brand. The value is derived from the product's performance, durability, and price.
**Evidence:**
*   Goodyear's business is based on manufacturing and selling tires, a traditional industrial product. There is no evidence of a user base that creates a network effect. (General Industry Knowledge)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for tires are low for consumers. While there is some stickiness with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), they can and do switch suppliers. Fleet customers may have some contractual lock-in, but this is not a strong moat.
**Evidence:**
*   Goodyear has a significant presence in the commercial truck market, where fleet customers may have contracts. However, the tire industry is competitive, and switching suppliers is common.
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning:** Goodyear is undertaking a significant cost-cutting program called "Goodyear Forward." This plan aims to deliver $1.5 billion in cost reductions and margin expansion by the end of 2025. This indicates a focus on improving its cost structure.
**Evidence:**
*   The "Goodyear Forward" plan is expected to deliver an additional $750 million in segment operating income in 2025.
*   The annualized run-rate targets for the "Goodyear Forward" plan were increased from $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning:** Goodyear has a strong brand name, which is a key asset in the tire industry. The company has a long history and is one of the most recognized tire brands globally. However, the company recently sold its Dunlop brand, which indicates a portfolio optimization strategy.
**Evidence:**
*   Goodyear is a well-established company, founded in 1898.
*   The company completed the sale of the Dunlop brand in early 2025.
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning:** Goodyear has a vast global network of production facilities and distribution channels. This scale is a competitive advantage, as it allows the company to serve a wide range of customers and markets efficiently.
**Evidence:**
*   Goodyear has a global footprint with a vast network of production facilities and robust distribution channels.
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning:** While Goodyear likely collects data from its tire performance and sales, there is no evidence of a significant data advantage that translates into a strong competitive moat. The company does not appear to have a unique, hard-to-replicate dataset that drives product development and customer retention in a way that competitors cannot match.
**Evidence:**
*   There is no mention of a data-driven advantage in the reviewed materials.
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning:** Goodyear's business model is not based on an ecosystem or platform. The company does not have a third-party developer community or a marketplace for complementary products.
**Evidence:**
*   Goodyear's business is focused on the manufacturing and sale of tires and rubber products. There is no evidence of a platform or ecosystem strategy. (General Industry Knowledge)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning:** The tire industry is subject to safety and environmental regulations, which can create barriers to entry. Goodyear's established presence and compliance with these regulations give it an advantage over new entrants. The company also benefits from tariffs on imported tires.
**Evidence:**
*   Goodyear's U.S. tariff exposure is about one-fourth of the industry average, giving it a significant competitive advantage as tariffs rise.
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning:** The tire industry is highly capital-intensive, requiring significant investment in manufacturing plants and equipment. This creates a high barrier to entry for new competitors. Goodyear's existing manufacturing footprint is a key asset.
**Evidence:**
*   The "Goodyear Forward" plan includes footprint and plant optimization, highlighting the importance of manufacturing assets.
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning:** Goodyear has contracts with OEMs and fleet customers, which provide some revenue visibility. However, a significant portion of its revenue comes from the replacement tire market, which is more cyclical and less predictable.
**Evidence:**
*   Goodyear has a significant presence in the commercial truck market, which involves contracts with fleet customers.
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### Aggregation
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(0 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (4 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0 + 0.15 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.30 + 0.10 + 0 + 0.12 + 0.16 + 0.04 = 1.68

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 16.8 / 100

### Mapping
The weighted score of 16.8 falls into the 10 ≤ Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1.

### Moat Duration Justification
The estimated moat duration is 5-7 years. The company's competitive advantages are primarily based on its brand, scale, and capital intensity. These advantages are sustainable but not impenetrable. The "Goodyear Forward" plan, if successful, could strengthen the company's cost advantages and improve its competitive position.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Failure to execute the "Goodyear Forward" plan:** If the company fails to achieve the targeted cost savings and margin improvements, its competitive position could weaken.
2.  **Increased competition from low-cost imports:** A reduction in tariffs or an increase in competition from low-cost tire manufacturers could erode Goodyear's market share and pricing power.
3.  **Technological disruption:** The rise of electric and autonomous vehicles could change the tire industry landscape, and Goodyear's ability to innovate and adapt will be crucial.

### KPIs to Monitor
*   Segment operating income (SOI) margin
*   Progress of the "Goodyear Forward" plan in terms of cost savings
*   Market share in key segments (consumer, commercial)
*   Raw material costs
*   Net leverage
*   Free cash flow
*   Volume growth in the replacement and OEM channels
*   Impact of tariffs on profitability

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Goodyear's moat is currently narrow and relies on its brand recognition, economies of scale, and the capital-intensive nature of the tire industry. The company is in the midst of a significant transformation plan, "Goodyear Forward," which aims to improve its cost structure and profitability. The success of this plan is crucial for strengthening its competitive advantages. A successful execution of the plan could lead to a wider moat, while a failure could result in a further erosion of its competitive position.

moat rating is 1 / 5
