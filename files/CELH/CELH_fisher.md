Celsius Holdings, Inc., August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Celsius Holdings, Inc. Form 10-Q filed May 5, 2025, Form 10-Q filed November 5, 2024, and Form 10-Q filed August 5, 2024.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius operates in the growing functional energy drink category and is actively expanding its product portfolio and geographic reach. The company recently introduced CELSIUS® Hydration in 2025 and acquired Alani Nutrition LLC to enter new market segments. Furthermore, Celsius is aggressively pursuing international growth, having signed distribution agreements to enter the U.K., Ireland, France, Australia, and New Zealand in 2024 and 2025, leveraging partners like Suntory. This strategy of product and market expansion indicates a substantial runway for future sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to expanding its sales potential through both organic and inorganic growth. The company launched the CELSIUS® Essentials line in 2023 and the CELSIUS® Hydration line in 2025. Strategically, the company is also expanding its manufacturing capabilities with the acquisition of co-packer Big Beverages Contract Manufacturing, L.L.C. on November 1, 2024, and significantly grew its brand portfolio by acquiring Alani Nutrition LLC on April 1, 2025. These actions show a clear determination to develop new products, enter new markets, and vertically integrate to support future growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000093/celh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000093/celh-20240930.htm) (November 5, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s R&D spending is modest in absolute terms, with approximately $0.5 million spent in the six months ended June 30, 2024. This represents less than 0.1% of its revenue for the same period. However, the R&D efforts appear effective, as evidenced by the successful launches of new product lines like CELSIUS® Essentials and CELSIUS® Hydration. This suggests a high return on a relatively small investment, focusing on market-driven innovation rather than foundational research.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](httpshttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius has a formidable sales and distribution network, anchored by its long-term agreement with PepsiCo, which became its primary distributor in the U.S. in August 2022 and its exclusive distributor in Canada in January 2024. This partnership provides Celsius with unparalleled access to retail channels. The company is replicating this model for global expansion through exclusive agreements with Suntory for distribution in Europe and Oceania. The ability to secure and leverage these powerful distribution partners indicates a highly effective and above-average sales and business development organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company reported a gross profit margin of 52.3%, an increase from 51.2% in the same period of 2024. For the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the gross margin was 52%. These high margins indicate efficient production and strong pricing power within the premium functional energy drink category.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Celsius is actively taking steps to improve its profit margins through operational and strategic initiatives. The company's Q1 2025 financial results note that "Gross profit margin improvements resulted from decreases in raw and package material unit costs." More significantly, on November 1, 2024, Celsius acquired one of its co-packers, Big Beverages, to vertically integrate and gain better control over manufacturing costs. This strategic move into in-house production is a direct action aimed at maintaining and improving long-term margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000093/celh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000093/celh-20240930.htm) (November 5, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The provided SEC filings contain no specific information or metrics regarding labor relations, employee turnover, or personnel satisfaction. Without verifiable evidence on attrition rates, employee engagement, or union relations, it is not possible to determine if the company's labor and personnel relations are outstanding.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated stability at the top executive level, and its strategic partnership with PepsiCo includes a board seat for a Pepsi executive, suggesting strong alignment. In August 2024, the board adopted an Executive Severance Pay Plan and a form of Executive Change in Control and Indemnity Agreement, which are standard tools designed to retain key executives. While there are disclosed and regularly updated 10b5-1 trading plans for top executives, there are no indications of instability or discord within the executive team in the provided documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings name its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer and detail their responsibilities. The successful execution of major strategic initiatives, including the PepsiCo distribution agreement, international expansion, and the acquisition of Alani Nu, suggests a competent senior leadership team. However, the provided documents do not offer specific details about the depth of management beyond the named executive officers or discuss succession planning.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** None

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** After previously reporting a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, management concluded that as of March 31, 2025, its "disclosure controls and procedures were effective." The successful remediation of a material weakness related to revenue recognition, promotional allowances, and inventories indicates a serious and effective response to improve controls. The company also provides a detailed breakout of revenues by geography and discloses key financial metrics, suggesting adequate cost analysis.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the beverage industry, distribution is a key determinant of success, and Celsius's strategic, long-term partnership with PepsiCo provides a powerful competitive advantage that is difficult for smaller brands to replicate. This agreement grants Celsius access to an extensive and sophisticated distribution network. Additionally, the company's brand positioning as a "premium lifestyle and energy drink" that is "formulated to power active lifestyles" has created a strong, differentiated identity in a crowded market, attracting a loyal consumer base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently demonstrates a long-range outlook by prioritizing strategic investments for future growth over short-term profit maximization. The company is making significant marketing investments, which increased by $22.9 million in Q2 2024 year-over-year, to build its brand globally. Major capital-intensive decisions, such as the acquisition of a co-packer in late 2024 and the acquisition of Alani Nu in 2025, are clear indicators of a long-term strategy to build a durable, larger-scale enterprise.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000093/celh-20240930.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000093/celh-20240930.htm) (November 5, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong financial position to fund its organic growth. As of March 31, 2025, Celsius had $977.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated $103.4 million in operating cash flow for the quarter. However, the company completed its acquisition of Alani Nu on April 1, 2025, for $1.275 billion in cash and 22.45 million shares of common stock, which resulted in shareholder dilution. While this was a major strategic acquisition rather than financing for ordinary operations, and was partially funded by a new $900 million term loan, it demonstrates that large-scale M&A will involve equity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated transparency regarding both positive and negative developments. The company clearly disclosed a material weakness in its internal controls in its 2024 filings and subsequently reported on its successful remediation efforts by the first quarter of 2025. In its Q1 2025 report, management provided a direct explanation for a year-over-year revenue decline, attributing it to specific timing of promotions and product launches rather than avoiding the topic. Furthermore, the company has been transparent about an SEC inquiry that began in 2021 and was settled in 2025, disclosing the issue and its resolution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176624000057/celh-20240630.htm) (August 5, 2024)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent events prevent a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity. On January 17, 2025, Celsius settled with the SEC concerning "alleged reporting, books and records, internal accounting controls, and disclosure controls and procedures violations," paying a $3.0 million penalty without admitting or denying the findings. This issue, combined with the previously disclosed material weakness in financial reporting and ongoing shareholder lawsuits, indicates that while the issues may be resolved, management's record is not flawless.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1341766/000134176625000080/celh-20250331.htm) (May 5, 2025)

---
Synthesis:
Celsius Holdings scores well on Fisher's criteria related to its products, market potential, sales organization, and long-range planning. The company's key strengths are its powerful distribution partnership with PepsiCo, a clear strategy for international expansion, and strong gross margins. Weaknesses are concentrated in areas where public disclosures are limited, such as management depth and labor relations, as well as a recent SEC settlement and a large, dilutive acquisition that prevents a perfect score on financing and integrity. The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on the successful integration of the Alani Nu acquisition and its impact on revenue and profitability. A second key variable is the execution of its international expansion strategy with Suntory; achieving significant sales in new major markets like the U.K. and Australia would reinforce the company's growth runway. To flip the "No" on integrity to "Yes," the company would need a sustained period without any new regulatory issues or shareholder lawsuits of merit.

fisher score is 11 / 15
