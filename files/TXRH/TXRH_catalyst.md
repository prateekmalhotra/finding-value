### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On February 19, 2025, the Board approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $500.0 million of common stock, replacing the previous program. The execution of this authorization through open market purchases can provide a direct catalyst by reducing share count and signaling management's belief that the stock is undervalued.
*   **Mechanism:** Share repurchases reduce the number of shares outstanding, which directly increases Earnings Per Share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. A higher EPS, applied to a stable P/E multiple, results in a higher share price. Aggressive buybacks can also create incremental demand for the stock, supporting its price.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026. The program has no expiration date, but companies typically execute opportunistically within the first 1-2 years of authorization.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case:** Repurchase of $150M at an average price of $175/share = ~857,000 shares retired (~1.3% of shares outstanding).
    *   **Base Case:** Repurchase of $250M at an average price of $175/share = ~1,428,000 shares retired (~2.1% of shares outstanding).
    *   **High Case:** Repurchase of $400M at an average price of $175/share = ~2,285,000 shares retired (~3.4% of shares outstanding).
    *   *Note: Share count of 66,574,626 as of Dec 31, 2024 (10-K, Feb 28, 2025).*
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (2-5%). The impact is primarily from the EPS accretion. A 2.1% reduction in share count (Base Case) would, all else being equal, increase EPS by a corresponding amount, likely leading to a similar increase in share price over time.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has a history of executing repurchase programs, having spent $79.8 million in 2024. The large new authorization signals strong intent.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must generate sufficient free cash flow to fund repurchases without compromising operational investments or dividend payments. The stock price must be perceived as attractive by management.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly cash flow statements (cash used in financing activities).
    *   "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" table in 10-Q/10-K filings.
    *   Changes in shares outstanding in quarterly earnings reports.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A sharp run-up in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   A significant operational downturn could divert cash flow to debt repayment or internal needs.
    *   Management may choose to prioritize dividends or acquisitions over buybacks.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of repurchases in upcoming quarterly reports as an indicator of management's confidence and capital allocation strategy.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Sustained Comparable Restaurant Sales Growth Above Inflation
*   **Type:** Operational / Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In 2024, the company delivered strong comparable restaurant sales growth of 8.5%, driven by a 4.4% increase in guest traffic and a 4.1% increase in average check. Continuing this trend, particularly in guest traffic, in a high-inflation environment would demonstrate pricing power and strong consumer demand, leading to upward revisions in earnings estimates.
*   **Mechanism:** Strong comparable sales growth directly increases revenue and, due to operating leverage, can increase restaurant-level margins and net income at a faster rate. If the market perceives this growth as sustainable, it will likely assign a higher valuation multiple (P/E) to the stock, leading to price appreciation.
*   **Timing:** Immediate and ongoing, with key data points at quarterly earnings releases through Q2 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Case (5% growth):** $5.34B 2024 sales * 1.05 = $5.61B revenue. At a stable 17.1% restaurant margin, this adds ~$148M in restaurant margin dollars.
    *   **Base Case (7% growth):** $5.34B 2024 sales * 1.07 = $5.71B revenue. At a stable 17.1% restaurant margin, this adds ~$210M in restaurant margin dollars.
    *   **High Case (9% growth):** $5.34B 2024 sales * 1.09 = $5.82B revenue. At a slightly improved 17.5% margin, this adds ~$282M in restaurant margin dollars.
    *   *Note: Calculations use 2024 Restaurant Sales of $5,341.9M and 2024 Restaurant Margin of 17.1% (10-K, Feb 28, 2025).*
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). Continued high-single-digit growth would likely beat expectations and drive EPS significantly higher, justifying a stock re-rating.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. The company has a strong track record, but maintaining high traffic growth becomes more difficult as the base gets larger and consumer spending faces macroeconomic pressures.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued consumer demand for the Texas Roadhouse brand, effective menu pricing that doesn't deter traffic, and successful local marketing initiatives.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly comparable restaurant sales figures (total, traffic, and check).
    *   Restaurant-level margin percentage.
    *   Management commentary on consumer trends in quarterly reports.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A slowdown in consumer discretionary spending due to economic weakness.
    *   Increased competition or a shift in consumer preferences.
    *   Inability to offset commodity and labor inflation with price increases, hurting margins.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The brand's momentum is a strong positive indicator. This is a core driver of the investment thesis.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** New Unit Expansion and Maturation
*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company continues to expand its footprint, opening 31 company-owned restaurants (26 Texas Roadhouse, 4 Bubba's 33, 1 Jaggers) in 2024. The long-term plan to grow the store base provides a clear, multi-year pathway to revenue and earnings growth as new units open and ramp up to mature sales levels.
*   **Mechanism:** Each new restaurant adds a new stream of revenue and profit. As these units mature over several years, their sales volumes typically increase, contributing to both total growth and, eventually, comparable sales growth. This steady unit growth is a fundamental driver of long-term EPS compounding.
*   **Timing:** 2026 – 2030. The company expects approximately 5% store week growth in 2025, which includes the benefit of a franchise acquisition.
*   **Quantification (Illustrative 3-year scenario):**
    *   Assume 30 new company units per year for 3 years = 90 new units.
    *   Assume average unit volume (AUV) for a mature Texas Roadhouse is $8.49M (10-K, Feb 28, 2025).
    *   **Incremental Revenue:** 90 units * $8.49M AUV (at maturity) = ~$764M in additional annual revenue.
    *   **Incremental Profit:** $764M revenue * 17.1% restaurant margin = ~$130.6M in additional annual restaurant-level profit, before G&A and taxes.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (15-25%) over the multi-year period. This represents the fundamental growth algorithm of the company and is a core part of its valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. Unit development is a core competency and a well-established part of the company's strategy with a long runway for growth.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Ability to secure attractive real estate sites, manage construction costs, and staff new locations with well-trained managers and employees.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Number of new company-owned restaurant openings per quarter.
    *   Capital expenditures on new restaurants.
    *   Performance of new restaurants (sales and margins) as discussed by management.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Significant inflation in construction and real estate costs could make new units less profitable.
    *   Market saturation in key regions could slow the pace of openings.
    *   Failure of newer concepts (Bubba's 33, Jaggers) to achieve target returns could slow overall unit growth.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is the primary long-term value creation engine for the company.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Sustained Comparable Sales Growth (Base Case)**
*   **Logic:** A 7% increase in 2025 revenue driven by comps, with stable margins, flows through to net income.
*   **Formula:** ((2024 Revenue * 1.07) * 2024 Net Income Margin) / Shares Outstanding = 2025 EPS Estimate
*   **Inputs:**
    *   2024 Revenue: $5,373M
    *   2024 Net Income: $433.6M (8.1% margin)
    *   Shares Outstanding (Diluted): 67.0M
*   **Calculation:** (($5,373M * 1.07) * 0.081) / 67.0M = $6.95 EPS
*   **Valuation:** $6.95 EPS * 26x P/E (Current Approx.) = ~$180.7 / share (~+6% from a hypothetical $170 base)

**2. Share Repurchase Program Execution (Base Case)**
*   **Logic:** A $250M repurchase reduces share count, increasing EPS.
*   **Formula:** 2024 Net Income / (Shares Outstanding - Repurchased Shares) = Pro-forma EPS
*   **Inputs:**
    *   2024 Net Income: $433.6M
    *   Shares Outstanding (Diluted): 67.0M
    *   Repurchased Shares: 1.43M (from Base Case quantification)
*   **Calculation:** $433.6M / (67.0M - 1.43M) = $6.61 EPS (vs. $6.47 actual 2024)
*   **Valuation:** $6.61 EPS * 26x P/E = ~$171.8 / share (~+1.1% from a hypothetical $170 base)

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts appears positive. The primary operational driver—strong comparable sales growth—is a powerful force that can significantly lift earnings. This is supported by a strong capital return framework, including a newly authorized $500 million share repurchase program and a consistent, growing dividend. While insider sales are a minor negative signal, they are likely pre-planned and outweighed by the positive fundamental momentum and corporate actions. The market signal is therefore positive for the 0-12 month horizon, contingent on the company continuing to execute and the consumer remaining resilient.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Macroeconomic Downturn:** A significant recession could sharply curtail consumer discretionary spending, leading to negative guest traffic and comparable sales, which would invalidate the core growth catalyst.
2.  **Major Food Commodity Spike:** A sharp, sustained increase in beef prices (which constitute ~50% of food costs) that cannot be passed on to consumers would severely compress restaurant margins and profitability.
3.  **Food Safety or Brand-Damaging Incident:** A significant food-borne illness outbreak or a major negative publicity event could cause immediate and lasting damage to the brand's reputation, leading to a steep decline in customer traffic.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

I recommend a **Buy** rating for TXRH. The primary catalyst is the company's demonstrated ability to generate strong, traffic-driven comparable sales growth, which is expected to continue driving near-term earnings upside in the 10-20% range. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly guest traffic count, as its continued strength is the clearest signal of the brand's health and pricing power.
