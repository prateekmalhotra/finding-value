**3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution
    *   **Type:** Corporate Action
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Ferrari announced the eighth tranche of its multi-year share buyback program, intending to repurchase up to €360 million of its common shares between August 22, 2025, and December 18, 2025. This is part of a larger, approximately €2 billion program announced in 2022.
    *   **Mechanism:** Share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which should increase earnings per share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. A higher EPS can lead to a higher stock price, as the market may apply the same P/E multiple to a higher EPS number. It also signals management's confidence in the company's future prospects and can create a floor for the stock price.
    *   **Timing:** August 22, 2025 – December 18, 2025.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Case:** €200 million repurchased at an average price of €400/share = 500,000 shares retired.
        *   **Base Case:** €360 million repurchased at an average price of €400/share = 900,000 shares retired.
        *   **High Case:** €360 million repurchased at an average price of €380/share (if the stock pulls back) = ~947,000 shares retired.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (+1-3%). The buyback is a continuation of an existing program, so it is largely priced in. The impact will be a steady buying pressure and a signal of confidence.
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The company has a history of executing its buyback program, and this tranche has been formally announced.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The company must have sufficient cash flow to execute the buyback without impacting its operational plans. The share price must remain at a level that management deems attractive for repurchases.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
        *   Weekly or monthly reports on the progress of the buyback program on Ferrari's corporate website.
        *   Changes in the number of treasury shares reported in quarterly earnings releases.
        *   Daily trading volume and price action in RACE shares.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant market downturn could lead to the suspension of the buyback program. A sudden need for cash for a large acquisition or a significant operational issue could divert funds from the buyback.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The buyback provides a supportive element for the stock, but it's not a primary driver for a significant re-rating on its own.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Launch of First All-Electric Vehicle
    *   **Type:** Product
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Ferrari plans to unveil its first-ever fully electric vehicle in the fourth quarter of 2025. This marks a significant strategic shift for the iconic brand, known for its powerful combustion engines.
    *   **Mechanism:** A successful launch of a high-performance, desirable EV could expand Ferrari's addressable market to include environmentally conscious ultra-luxury buyers. It would also demonstrate the company's ability to adapt to the changing automotive landscape, potentially leading to a re-rating of the stock by investors who see a longer-term growth runway. The launch could also generate significant media attention and brand buzz.
    *   **Timing:** Q4 2025 (unveiling). Deliveries would likely start in 2026.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Case:** The EV is poorly received, with limited orders and negative reviews. The impact on revenue in the near term is negligible.
        *   **Base Case:** The EV meets expectations, generating a strong order book similar to other new models. This could add €500M - €1B to the order book in the first 12 months post-launch.
        *   **High Case:** The EV is a massive success, exceeding expectations and attracting a new wave of customers. The order book could swell by over €1.5B, and the positive sentiment could lead to a significant multiple expansion.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+10-20%). A successful unveiling with strong initial interest could lead to a re-evaluation of Ferrari's long-term growth prospects.
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 90%. The CEO has repeatedly confirmed the timeline.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** The vehicle's design, performance, and technology must be compelling and live up to the Ferrari brand's reputation. The company must effectively manage the production ramp-up.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
        *   Media coverage and reviews following the Q4 2025 unveiling.
        *   Management commentary on the order book for the new EV in subsequent earnings calls.
        *   Any pre-launch marketing materials or "teaser" campaigns.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** The EV could be a disappointment in terms of design or performance. Technical glitches or production delays could tarnish the launch. The high price point (rumored to be above €500,000) could limit demand.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The launch of the first EV is a major milestone for Ferrari. A successful launch could have a significant positive impact on the stock.

**4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Successful Ramp-up and Expansion of the Electric Vehicle Lineup
    *   **Type:** Product / Operational
    *   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Following the launch of the first EV in late 2025, Ferrari will focus on ramping up production and potentially introducing additional electric models. This is a critical part of the company's long-term strategy to thrive in a carbon-neutral world.
    *   **Mechanism:** A successful EV lineup will allow Ferrari to capture a growing segment of the luxury car market and comply with increasingly stringent emissions regulations. This will be a key driver of revenue and earnings growth in the long term, and will help to de-risk the business from its reliance on internal combustion engines. A successful EV strategy could also support a premium valuation multiple for the stock.
    *   **Timing:** 2026-2030.
    *   **Quantification:**
        *   **Low Case:** The EV lineup struggles to gain traction, with sales of only a few hundred units per year. This would represent a drag on profitability due to the high R&D and capital expenditures.
        *   **Base Case:** Ferrari successfully ramps up production of its first EV and launches a second model by 2028. EVs could account for 10-15% of total shipments by 2030, with a positive impact on margins due to high personalization and pricing power.
        *   **High Case:** Ferrari's EVs become the new benchmark for electric supercars, driving strong demand and allowing the company to expand its EV lineup to three or four models by 2030. EVs could represent over 25% of shipments by the end of the decade, leading to a significant increase in revenue and earnings.
    *   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). The successful electrification of the Ferrari brand is the most significant long-term driver for the stock.
    *   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. Execution risk is high, but Ferrari has a strong track record of product excellence.
    *   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Ferrari must be able to secure a stable supply of batteries and other key components for its EVs. The company must also be able to maintain its brand exclusivity and pricing power in the EV segment.
    *   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
        *   Management commentary on EV production and sales in quarterly earnings calls.
        *   Announcements of new EV models.
        *   Capital expenditure plans related to electrification.
    *   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Ferrari's EVs could fail to resonate with customers, or the company could struggle to compete with other luxury EV makers. The high cost of developing and producing EVs could pressure margins.
    *   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The long-term potential of Ferrari's electrification strategy is a compelling reason to own the stock.

**5) Prioritization & Scoring Table**

| ID | Title | Type | Timing (Near/Long) | Impact Score (1–5) | Probability Score (1–5) | Expected Impact (% price range) | Weighted Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Launch of First All-Electric Vehicle | Product | Near | 4 | 4 | +10-20% | 16 |
| 2 | Successful Ramp-up of EV Lineup | Product / Operational | Long | 5 | 3 | >30% | 15 |
| 3 | Strong Financial Performance | Financial | Near | 3 | 4 | +5-10% | 12 |
| 4 | Share Repurchase Program | Corporate Action | Near | 2 | 5 | +1-3% | 10 |

**6) Timeline / Gantt (concise)**

*   **Q3 2025:** Execution of the eighth tranche of the share buyback program.
*   **Q4 2025:** Unveiling of the first all-electric Ferrari.
*   **Q1 2026:** First deliveries of the all-electric Ferrari.
*   **2026-2027:** Ramp-up of EV production and potential announcement of a second EV model.

**7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

*   **Launch of First All-Electric Vehicle (Base Case):**
    *   Assumption: The successful launch adds €750 million to the order book.
    *   Formula: Increase in enterprise value = Present value of future cash flows from the new model. A simplified approach is to apply a multiple to the incremental revenue.
    *   Calculation: Assuming a 30% net margin on the new model (€225 million) and a 30x P/E multiple, this could add ~€6.75 billion to the market cap, which would translate to a ~10-15% increase in the share price. This is a rough, illustrative calculation.

**8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for Ferrari is positive. The ongoing share buyback program provides a degree of support for the stock, while the upcoming launch of the first all-electric vehicle is a major potential catalyst that could drive a re-rating of the shares. The company's strong financial performance and robust order book provide a solid foundation. The primary risk in the near term is a delay or a poorly received launch of the EV.

**10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A botched launch of the first electric vehicle:** If the EV is a critical failure, it could damage the brand and call into question the company's long-term strategy.
2.  **A severe global recession:** A major economic downturn would significantly impact demand for luxury goods, including Ferrari's cars.
3.  **A major operational disruption:** A fire at a key factory, a prolonged labor strike, or a major supply chain disruption could halt production and have a severe impact on financial results.

**11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

We recommend a "Buy" rating for Ferrari N.V. with a 12-month price target range of €440-€480, representing a potential upside of 10-20%. The primary catalyst is the upcoming launch of the company's first all-electric vehicle in Q4 2025. The most important indicator to monitor will be the initial market reception and order book for this new model.
