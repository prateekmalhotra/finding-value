### **C) Forecast & Assumptions**

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Citation / Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | **1.5%** (Midpoint of management's 1-2% guidance). | (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 29, 2025) |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)** | **1.5% in Y2, tapering to 1.0% for Y3-5.** Reflects initial momentum from brand reinvigoration before stabilizing. | (Analyst Estimate) |
| **Operating Margin** | **8.3%** held flat. Derived from TTM EBIT growing at the 9% midpoint of guidance. Expansion from TTM 7.7% is justified by guidance for margin expansion and SG&A leverage. Held flat post-Y1 due to lack of specific drivers for further expansion. | (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 29, 2025) |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | **26.0%**. Based on the most recent normalized full-year tax rate (25.8%), as prior years included significant one-time items. | (10-K, Feb 1, 2025) |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **3.4%**. The 3-year historical average (FY22-24), in the absence of explicit guidance. | (10-K, Feb 1, 2025) |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.90%**. The TTM average. | (10-K FY24, 10-Q Q1'25) |
| **Change in WC** | **2.0% of incremental revenue**. A conservative assumption reflecting modest investment needed for growth. | (Analyst Estimate) |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $15,388 | $15,619 | $15,775 | $15,933 | $16,092 |
| *Growth* | *1.5%* | *1.5%* | *1.0%* | *1.0%* | *1.0%* |
| EBIT | $1,277 | $1,296 | $1,309 | $1,322 | $1,336 |
| *Margin* | *8.3%* | *8.3%* | *8.3%* | *8.3%* | *8.3%* |
| NOPAT (EBIT\*(1-T)) | $945 | $959 | $969 | $978 | $988 |
| \+ D&A | $497 | $497 | $497 | $497 | $497 |
| \- Stock-Based Comp | $138 | $141 | $142 | $143 | $145 |
| \- Capex | $523 | $531 | $536 | $542 | $547 |
| \- Change in WC | $5 | $5 | $3 | $3 | $3 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$776** | **$779** | **$785** | **$787** | **$790** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale / Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk-Free Rate** | **4.29%** | (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025) |
| **Equity Risk Premium** | **5.0%** | (Standard market assumption) |
| **Beta (β)** | **1.20** | Assumed to reflect slightly higher-than-market risk for a cyclical apparel retailer in a turnaround. |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **10.29%** | Formula: `Rf + β * ERP` |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | **6.0%** | (TTM Interest Expense / Average Debt) |
| **Tax Rate** | **26.0%** | (Forecast Assumption) |
| **Market Cap (E)** | **$7,927M** | ($20.75 share price \* 382M shares) |
| **Net Debt (D)** | **($730M)** | ($1,490M Debt - $2,220M Cash) |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$7,197M** | (E + D) |
| **WACC** | **9.4%** | Formula: `(E/V)*Ke + (D/V)*Kd*(1-T)` |

### **F) Terminal Value**
1.  **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Formula:** `TV = [FCFF_Y5 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)`
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Assumed long-run inflation rate)
    *   **Calculation:** `TV = [$790 * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.094 - 0.025)` = `$810 / 0.069` = **$11,739 million**

2.  **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **EBITDA Year 5:** EBIT_Y5 + D&A_Y5 = $1,336M + $497M = $1,833M
    *   **Exit Multiple:** 8.0x (A conservative multiple between the current TTM of ~6.5x and the 5-year median of 12.0x)
    *   **Calculation:** `TV = $1,833M * 8.0` = **$14,664 million**

Given the significant discrepancy, the lower value from the more conservative Gordon Growth method is used for the base case.
*   **Selected Terminal Value:** **$11,739 million**

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
1.  **Enterprise Value (EV):**
    *   **Formula:** `EV = PV(FCFF Y1-5) + PV(Terminal Value)`
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF: `$776/(1.094)^1 + $779/(1.094)^2 + $785/(1.094)^3 + $787/(1.094)^4 + $790/(1.094)^5` = $709 + $649 + $599 + $552 + $507 = **$3,016 million**
    *   PV of Terminal Value: `$11,739 / (1.094)^5` = **$7,522 million**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value:** `$3,016M + $7,522M` = **$10,538 million**

2.  **Equity Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt`
    *   **Net Debt:** $1,490M (Total Debt) - $2,220M (Cash) = **-$730 million** (Net Cash)
    *   **Equity Value:** `$10,538M - (-$730M)` = **$11,268 million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

1.  **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Formula:** `Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding`
    *   **Calculation:** `$11,268M / 382M shares` = **$29.50 per share**

2.  **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $29.50.** Assumes 1.0-1.5% revenue growth and stable 8.3% operating margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $21.00.** Assumes 0% revenue growth, margin compression to 7.0%, and a higher discount rate of 10.5%, reflecting failure to execute the turnaround.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $39.00.** Assumes sustained 2.5% revenue growth, margin expansion to 9.5% driven by strong brand performance, and a lower discount rate of 8.5%.

3.  **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the Base-Case Fair Value provides a buffer for estimation errors and unforeseen risks.
    *   **MOS Price:** `$29.50 * (1 - 0.30)` = **$20.65**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Execution Risk:** The valuation is contingent on management's ability to successfully continue the "brand reinvigoration," particularly at Old Navy and Gap, and stabilize performance at Athleta and Banana Republic. Failure to execute could lead to lower growth and margin compression.
2.  **Macroeconomic Headwinds:** As a discretionary retailer, GAP is susceptible to downturns in consumer spending caused by inflation, high interest rates, or recession.
3.  **Competitive Pressure:** The apparel industry is intensely competitive with low barriers to entry and rapid shifts in consumer taste. Failure to anticipate trends or respond to competitive pricing can quickly erode market share and profitability.
4.  **Input Cost & Tariff Volatility:** The business is exposed to fluctuations in commodity costs (e.g., cotton) and potential changes in U.S. trade policy and tariffs, which could negatively impact gross margins as noted by management.
5.  **Inventory Management:** Misjudging demand can lead to excess inventory, requiring heavy markdowns that hurt gross margins, or stock-outs that result in lost sales and frustrated customers.

final answer is 29.50 $
