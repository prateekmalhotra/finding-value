**7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Sustained Double-Digit Subscriber and Revenue Growth**
*   **Assumption:** A 20% increase in revenue over the next 12 months, with the P/S ratio remaining constant.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Current Market Cap: ~$1.46B
    *   Current Annualized Revenue (Q1 2026 * 4): ZAR 1,141M * 4 = ZAR 4,564M
    *   Projected Revenue (with 20% growth): ZAR 4,564M * 1.20 = ZAR 5,477M
    *   Projected Market Cap: $1.46B * 1.20 = $1.75B
*   **Impact:** This represents a potential 20% upside to the stock price.

**2. Margin Expansion and Improved Profitability**
*   **Assumption:** Operating margin expands from 30% to 32%, with revenue and P/E ratio remaining constant.
*   **Calculation:**
    *   This would lead to a ~6.7% increase in operating profit (32/30 - 1).
    *   Assuming a constant P/E ratio, this would translate to a similar increase in the stock price.
*   **Impact:** This represents a potential ~6.7% upside to the stock price.

**10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Global Recession:** A severe global recession would likely lead to a slowdown in demand for Karooooo's products and services, as businesses cut back on spending.
2.  **Increased Competition:** The telematics and fleet management market is becoming increasingly competitive. A new entrant with a disruptive technology or business model could put pressure on Karooooo's growth and profitability.
3.  **Execution Missteps:** As Karooooo expands into new markets and business segments, there is a risk of execution missteps that could damage the company's reputation and financial performance.

**11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**
Karooooo is a high-quality growth company with a strong track record of execution. The stock is supported by several near-term and long-term catalysts, including sustained double-digit subscriber and revenue growth, margin expansion, and the growth of Karooooo Logistics. The biggest risk is a global recession, but the company's recurring revenue model and strong balance sheet provide a degree of resilience.
