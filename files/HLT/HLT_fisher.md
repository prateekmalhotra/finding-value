**Synthesis:**
Hilton Worldwide Holdings scores very highly on Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a strong, well-managed business with a long runway for growth. The company's key strengths lie in its massive and growing development pipeline, its capital-light, fee-based business model, and its powerful Hilton Honors loyalty program. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months would be a significant global economic downturn that could slow the pace of new hotel development and travel demand, or a major cybersecurity breach that could damage the reputation of the Hilton Honors program. To maintain its high score, Hilton must continue to execute on its development pipeline, innovate its brand portfolio, and maintain its strong relationships with hotel owners and guests.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
