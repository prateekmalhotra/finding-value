Company: Henry Schein, Inc. (HSIC)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Annual Report (10-K) filed February 25, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Henry Schein operates in the large and growing dental and medical supply markets. Favorable long-term macro trends, including an aging population and increased healthcare awareness, are expected to stimulate patient traffic and demand. The U.S. Census Bureau projects the population aged 45 and older will grow by approximately 10% between 2024 and 2034, a key demographic for healthcare services. The company serves over one million customers worldwide with a comprehensive selection of more than 300,000 products, indicating a large addressable market.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's BOLD+1 Strategic Plan explicitly states a focus to "Build Complementary software, specialty, and services businesses for high growth" and to "Drive Digital transformation for our customers and for Henry Schein". A key part of their strategy is to "Pursue strategic acquisitions and joint ventures" to access new products and technologies. In 2023 and early 2024, the company made several acquisitions, including Biotech Dental, S.I.N. Implant System, and TriMed, to bolster its specialty products portfolio.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a distributor, Henry Schein's R&D spending is not disclosed as a separate line item in its consolidated financial statements, making a direct comparison to manufacturing-focused peers difficult. The company's innovation model relies heavily on acquiring companies with strong R&D pipelines, such as Biotech Dental and TriMed, particularly in its Global Specialty Products and Global Technology segments. This strategy is effective for a distribution-centric model, but direct R&D output metrics like patents are not a primary focus at the consolidated level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Henry Schein possesses a large and sophisticated sales and marketing organization. As of the 2024 10-K, the company employed more than 3,860 field sales consultants and approximately 1,950 telesales representatives worldwide. This extensive network allows for direct, personal contact with its customer base of over one million healthcare providers. The company emphasizes a consultative selling process and leverages its e-commerce platforms to facilitate ease of ordering and solidify customer relationships.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 28, 2024, Henry Schein's gross profit margin was 31.7% and its operating margin was 4.9%. As a distributor, its margins are naturally lower than those of pure manufacturers. However, its higher-margin segments, Global Specialty Products (55.4% gross margin) and Global Technology (67.4% gross margin), demonstrate profitability in key growth areas. When compared to its closest distribution competitor, Patterson Companies, which has a gross margin typically in the 20% range, Henry Schein's margins appear worthwhile for its industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing margin improvement. The company's BOLD+1 strategy includes "Operationalize One Distribution to deliver... increased efficiency, and growth". On August 6, 2024, the company initiated a new restructuring plan to "integrate recent acquisitions, right-size operations and further increase efficiencies". The company is also focused on growing its higher-margin Global Specialty Products and Technology segments, which inherently improves the consolidated margin mix.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company states in its 2024 10-K, "We believe that our relations with our employees are excellent." It employs approximately 25,000 people, with about 13% subject to collective bargaining agreements. The company details its "TSM (Team Schein Members) experience strategy" which is centered on Community, Caring, and Career, and notes that its annual "Pulse Global Culture Survey" indicates TSMs "generally remain satisfied with their work experience."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is significant stability and experience within the executive team. Stanley M. Bergman has been Chairman and CEO since 1989. Many other senior executives have tenures exceeding a decade with the company, indicating stable leadership. The 10-K outlines a clear internal succession plan for its senior leadership team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Henry Schein's 2024 10-K lists a deep bench of 16 executive officers and other executive management beyond the CEO, with clear roles and responsibilities. This includes CEOs for its major business units like Global Distribution and Technology, North America Distribution, and the Products Group. This structure demonstrates a decentralized leadership model with experienced leaders managing key segments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, BDO USA, P.C., provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 28, 2024. The 10-K also includes a report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, stating it was effective as of December 28, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting, allowing for clear analysis of performance by business unit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the healthcare distribution industry, logistics, scale, and customer relationships are paramount. Henry Schein's network of 36 distribution centers and its ability to offer over 300,000 products provide significant scale advantages. Its value-added services, including practice management software (Henry Schein One) and financial services, create stickiness and a deeper relationship with practitioners than a pure-play distributor, fostering loyalty beyond just price. This integrated model of distribution, technology, and specialty products is a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent strategy of growth through acquisition, as detailed in the 10-K, demonstrates a long-range outlook. These acquisitions, while potentially dilutive to short-term earnings, are aimed at building out higher-growth, higher-margin businesses in specialty products and technology. The BOLD+1 Strategic Plan emphasizes building these complementary businesses for long-term high growth. Furthermore, the company is undertaking significant restructuring plans in 2022 and 2024 to drive future efficiencies, which can depress short-term results for long-term gain.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong history of funding its growth through cash from operations and debt, while simultaneously returning capital to shareholders. For the year ended December 28, 2024, the company generated $848 million in cash from operations. The company has a consistent share repurchase program, buying back $385 million of its stock in fiscal 2024. This demonstrates a commitment to avoiding dilution and a financial capacity to fund operations and acquisitions without issuing new equity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed discussions of challenges in its public filings. For instance, the 2024 10-K includes a thorough disclosure and discussion of the October 2023 cybersecurity incident, its impact on business operations and financial results, and the remediation efforts undertaken. Management also openly discussed the sales impact of the incident, noting a decrease in sales to "episodic customers" and outlining programs to re-establish these relationships. This level of detail on a significant negative event suggests a culture of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the "Legal Proceedings" and "Risk Factors" sections of the 2024 10-K reveals no material legal or regulatory actions that would question the integrity of the senior management team. The company operates in a highly regulated industry and outlines an extensive compliance program to adhere to various laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The long tenure of the executive team and the company's consistent operating history as a Fortune 500 company since 2004 also support this point.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1000228/000100022825000014/hsic-20241228.htm) (February 25, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEBVIPur_iVO5Vmu2YRxjb3K8tsL1-C3UQ-yCz6mE7HLTSE8ZmVf_MlQJEYquxHs4E0Vr1xA04N7Kxwt2dK-GZ6PE_EhvnT5CbenZmARcUR2_a9oKR-93KjcxF6](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEBVIPur_iVO5Vmu2YRxjb3K8tsL1-C3UQ-yCz6mE7HLTSE8ZmVf_MlQJEYquxHs4E0Vr1xA04N7Kxwt2dK-GZ6PE_EhvnT5CbenZmARcUR2_a9oKR-93KjcxF6) (August 22, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Henry Schein scores strongly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its position as a mature, well-managed industry leader with a solid long-term strategy. Its primary strengths lie in its dominant market position with a long runway for growth, a robust and experienced management team, and a sound financial footing that allows for growth without shareholder dilution. The company's integrated strategy, combining distribution with high-margin technology and specialty products, provides a significant competitive advantage. The main area of weakness is the lack of clarity on R&D effectiveness, which is a byproduct of its distribution-focused business model that relies on acquisition for innovation rather than internal development. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the successful integration of recent acquisitions and the execution of its 2024 restructuring plan; tangible evidence of margin improvement and renewed organic growth in the core distribution business post-cybersecurity incident would be key positive indicators. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could flip to a "Yes" if the company began to disclose specific metrics on the innovation and market success stemming from its acquired specialty and technology businesses.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
