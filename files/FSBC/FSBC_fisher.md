**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** The bank is well-capitalized, with all capital ratios exceeding regulatory thresholds. The company did conduct a public offering in April 2024, which resulted in some dilution, but the proceeds are being used to fund growth.

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

Synthesis:
Five Star Bancorp appears to be a well-managed community bank with a strong focus on its local market and a clear strategy for growth. The bank's expansion into the San Francisco Bay Area is a key positive, as it opens up a significant new market for the company. The bank's strong financial performance, including consistent loan and deposit growth and solid profitability metrics, is also a major strength. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12-24 months would be the success of the San Francisco expansion, the ability to maintain strong asset quality in a changing economic environment, and the impact of interest rate changes on the bank's net interest margin. To flip any "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to provide more specific details on its long-term product development roadmap and demonstrate a track record of successful innovation beyond its current offerings.

fisher score is 15 / 15
