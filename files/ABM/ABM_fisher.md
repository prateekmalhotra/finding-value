**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM's core facility services, including janitorial and engineering, are essential and have a stable demand base. The company is also expanding into high-growth areas through its Technical Solutions segment. This segment, which includes EV charging infrastructure, microgrid systems, and data center solutions, is benefiting from the growing demand for sustainable and resilient energy solutions. For the three months ended January 31, 2025, the Technical Solutions segment's revenue increased by 21.9% year-over-year, with 14.2% organic growth, indicating strong market demand and a long runway for growth. The recent acquisition of Quality Uptime further strengthens ABM's position in the mission-critical data center market.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commitment to ongoing development is evident through its "ELEVATE" strategy, a multiyear plan with a planned investment of $200-$215 million in technology and data analytics to enhance client and employee experiences and improve operational efficiency. Furthermore, ABM has a history of strategic acquisitions to enter new markets and enhance its service offerings. The recent acquisitions of RavenVolt (microgrids) in 2022 and Quality Uptime (UPS systems for data centers) in 2024 demonstrate a clear strategy of investing in high-growth technical services.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a services company, ABM's R&D is more focused on process innovation and technology adoption than traditional product development. The effectiveness of these efforts is demonstrated by the strong performance of its Technical Solutions segment, which leverages new technologies and services. The 21.9% revenue growth in this segment for the first quarter of fiscal 2025 is a direct result of the company's investments and acquisitions in areas like microgrids and critical power solutions. The company's ELEVATE strategy, with its focus on data and technology, is a significant investment in improving service delivery and operational efficiency, which is a form of R&D for a service-based business.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM has a well-structured sales and marketing organization with dedicated teams for its industry groups, supported by centralized resources. The company's ability to consistently win new business and expand relationships with existing clients is a testament to its sales effectiveness. For the three months ended January 31, 2025, organic revenue growth was driven by "net new business and expansion of business with existing customers within Aviation and Education." The company also has a high rate of client retention, which is crucial for profitability in the facility services industry.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024, ABM's gross margin was 12.4% and operating margin was 2.5%. For the three months ended January 31, 2025, gross margin improved to 12.3% from 11.8% in the prior year period, and operating margin was 3.7%. While the facility services industry is competitive and generally characterized by modest margins, ABM's margins are consistent and the company is profitable. The company is actively working on improving margins through operational efficiencies and a better mix of services.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm) (March 12, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM is focused on improving profit margins through several initiatives. The company's ELEVATE strategy is designed to enhance operational efficiency through technology and data analytics. In the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the company's gross margin increased due to "contract and service mix and operational efficiencies." Specific examples include "operational efficiencies, particularly in managing overtime, materials and supplies, and general and administrative headcount" in the Education segment and improved "contract mix" in the Aviation and Technical Solutions segments.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm) (March 12, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM employs approximately 117,000 people, with 42% of them unionized. The company emphasizes its commitment to its employees through competitive wages and benefits, training and development programs like the Leadership Academy, and a strong focus on safety with its "Think Safe" program. The company states that it strives to engage with its labor partners in an atmosphere of mutual respect. While the company lists labor relations as a risk factor, as any large employer would, there is no evidence of significant or widespread labor disputes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at ABM appears stable, with key leaders having been in their roles for several years. Scott Salmirs has served as CEO since 2015, providing consistent leadership. The company's consistent strategy, centered around the ELEVATE initiative, suggests a cohesive and aligned executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM's organizational structure, with its distinct industry groups, indicates a strong layer of management with specialized expertise in each of its key markets. The company also has a clear focus on developing internal talent and future leaders through programs like the Leadership Academy, which is designed to accelerate employees' readiness for future growth. This commitment to leadership development suggests a focus on building a deep bench of management talent.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024. This is a strong indication of good accounting controls. The company is in the process of implementing a new ERP system, which is intended to enhance internal controls and transactional reporting in the long run, although it can present some short-term challenges. The detailed segment reporting in the financial statements allows for a clear analysis of the company's different business lines.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm) (March 12, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the facility services industry, scale, reputation, and the ability to provide integrated services are key competitive advantages. ABM's long history (founded in 1909) and its position as a leading provider with over $8 billion in revenue give it significant scale and a strong reputation. The company's ability to offer a comprehensive suite of services, from janitorial to highly technical solutions like microgrids, allows it to act as a "one-stop shop" for clients, differentiating it from smaller, more specialized competitors. The industry-focused go-to-market strategy enables ABM to develop deep expertise and tailor its services to the specific needs of clients in different sectors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM's management demonstrates a long-range outlook through its significant investment in the ELEVATE strategy. This multiyear, $200-$215 million program is designed to drive long-term value by improving technology, data analytics, and operational processes, even at the cost of some short-term expenses. The company's strategy of acquiring businesses in emerging, high-growth areas like EV charging and data center services also reflects a focus on long-term growth rather than immediate profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** ABM has a strong financial position with sufficient resources to fund its growth. As of January 31, 2025, the company had $59.0 million in cash and cash equivalents and $238.0 million of borrowing capacity under its credit facility. The company generates healthy cash flow from operations, with $226.7 million for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2024. The company has an active share repurchase program, which reduces shareholder dilution, and has a long history of paying dividends.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm) (March 12, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Based on the MD&A section of its SEC filings, ABM's management appears to be candid with investors. For example, in the Q1 2025 10-Q, the company openly discussed the temporary negative impact of its new ERP system implementation on operating cash flow, stating that the transition "temporarily delayed invoicing to certain clients" but that they "anticipate improvement in our operating cash flows next quarter and full normalization in the second half of fiscal year 2025." This level of transparency about operational challenges suggests a culture of open communication with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149725000005/abm-20250131.htm) (March 12, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no significant red flags to suggest a lack of integrity in ABM's management. The company has a Code of Business Conduct that applies to all employees, officers, and directors, and provides annual training on it. The independent auditor's report is unqualified, and there are no reports of major scandals or regulatory actions against the company or its executives. While the company is involved in routine litigation, this is normal for a company of its size and scope.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/771497/000077149724000029/abm-20241031.htm) (December 19, 2024)

**Synthesis:**
ABM Industries appears to be a strong company that aligns well with many of Philip A. Fisher's investment criteria. Its key strengths are its stable core business, a clear strategy for growth in high-demand technical services, a committed and stable management team, and a solid financial position. The company's long-range outlook, demonstrated by its ELEVATE strategy and strategic acquisitions, is particularly noteworthy. The primary area that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is the performance of its Technical Solutions segment. Continued high growth and margin expansion in this area would further validate management's strategy and investment thesis. Conversely, a slowdown in this segment or unforeseen challenges with the integration of recent acquisitions could negatively impact the assessment. Evidence of successful cross-selling of these new technical services to ABM's existing client base would be a strong positive indicator and would solidify the "Yes" answers for several points, including long runway, R&D effectiveness, and sales organization.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
