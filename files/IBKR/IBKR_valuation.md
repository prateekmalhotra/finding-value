### **A) BASELINE FINANCIALS (TTM as of March 31, 2025)**

The trailing-twelve-months (TTM) financials are calculated by taking the audited Fiscal Year 2024 results, adding the first quarter of 2025, and subtracting the first quarter of 2024. All figures are in millions of USD.

| Diluted Shares Outstanding | 109.9 million | Q1 2025 10-Q (Mar 31, 2025) |

¹*Change in Working Capital for a financial institution is inherently volatile and large. For forecasting, a normalized percentage of incremental revenue is used.*

### **B) MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE EXTRACTION**

No explicit, quantitative forward-looking guidance on revenue, margins, or capex was provided in the recent earnings calls. Management commentary is focused on business strategy and reacting to market conditions.

*   **On Growth:** "We also saw global interest from investors, both institutional and individual, in opening accounts." (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, April 15, 2025)
*   **On Expenses:** "As always, we remain focused on expense discipline as reflected in our moderate staff increase of 5% over the prior year." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, July 17, 2025)
*   **On Interest Rate Sensitivity:** "At a high level, a full 1% decrease in all benchmark rates will decrease our annual net interest income by $328 million." (Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript, October 16, 2024)

### **C) FORECAST HORIZON AND BASE-CASE ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

| Assumption | Value/Method | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1-5)** | **10.0% annually** | Lacking guidance, this reflects a conservative estimate below the 3-year historical revenue CAGR (approx. 25%), acknowledging that recent growth was fueled by exceptional market conditions. It aligns with continued account growth mentioned by management. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **71.8%** | Based on the calculated TTM EBIT margin ($3,884M / $5,409M). Kept stable as there is no specific management guidance on margin expansion. This is consistent with the reported 71% pretax margin in 2024. (2024 10-K) |
| **Tax Rate** | **8.0%** | The average effective tax rate over the last 3 years has been between 7.8% and 8.4%. (StockAnalysis.com) |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **1.8%** | Based on the TTM D&A as a percentage of TTM revenue. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **2.1%** | Based on the TTM Stock-Based Compensation as a percentage of TTM revenue. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.0%** | Based on the TTM Capex as a percentage of TTM revenue. |
| **Change in NWC** | **20% of Δ Revenue** | A normalized rate is used due to the high volatility of working capital for a broker. This is a conservative assumption. |
| **Diluted Shares** | **109.9 million** | Latest reported diluted weighted-average shares. (Q1 2025 10-Q) |

### **D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Revenue | $5,950 | $6,545 | $7,200 | $7,920 | $8,712 |
| EBIT (71.8%) | $4,272 | $4,699 | $5,169 | $5,686 | $6,255 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 92%) | $3,930 | $4,323 | $4,756 | $5,231 | $5,754 |
| (+) D&A | $107 | $118 | $130 | $143 | $157 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | $125 | $137 | $151 | $166 | $183 |
| (-) Capex | $60 | $65 | $72 | $79 | $87 |
| (-) Change in NWC | $108 | $119 | $131 | $144 | $158 |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$3,744** | **$4,120** | **$4,532** | **$4,985** | **$5,483** |

### **E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.29% | 10-Year US Treasury Yield (August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard market premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta | 1.25 | 5-Year Monthly Beta. Reflects higher volatility than the market, which is typical for the financial services industry. (Investing.com) |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | **10.54%** | **Ke = 4.29% + 1.25 * 5.0%** |
| | | |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Interest Expense / Avg Debt | 19.5% | Using TTM Interest Expense and average debt. This is high due to the nature of IBKR's liabilities, many of which are related to customer balances and securities lending, not traditional corporate debt. A more reasonable estimate is needed. |
| Pre-tax Cost of Debt (Kd) | 5.5% | Assumed based on current corporate bond yields for A-rated companies. |
| Tax Rate | 8.0% | From assumptions above. |
| **After-Tax Cost of Debt** | **5.06%** | **Kd = 5.5% * (1 - 8.0%)** |
| | | |
| **WACC Calculation** | | |
| Market Value of Equity (E) | $6,857 M | 109.9M shares * $62.46/share (August 20, 2025) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $21,693 M | Total Debt from balance sheet. |
| Total Capital (V) | $28,550 M | E + D |
| Weight of Equity (E/V) | 24.0% | |
| Weight of Debt (D/V) | 76.0% | |
| **WACC** | **6.37%** | **WACC = (24.0% * 10.54%) + (76.0% * 5.06%)** |

---

### **F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**Gordon Growth Method:**
*   Terminal Growth Rate (g): **2.5%**. This is a conservative rate, in line with long-run inflation expectations.
*   Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
*   Terminal Value = ($5,483 * 1.025) / (6.37% - 2.5%) = **$144,976 million**

**Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   A historical median multiple is difficult for a unique company like IBKR. However, a conservative P/E multiple for a mature financial services firm might be around 10-12x. Year 5 Net Income can be estimated from EBIT.
*   Year 5 EBIT = $6,255M. Assuming Interest Expense is proportional to Revenue, Year 5 Interest Expense could be around $6,600M, but this is a flawed assumption.
*   A better cross-check is an EV/EBIT multiple. A reasonable multiple might be 8-10x.
*   Exit Multiple Terminal Value (8x Y5 EBIT) = 8 * $6,255 = **$50,040 million**
*   There is a significant discrepancy. The Gordon Growth method implies a very high exit multiple. The high level of debt in the capital structure is making WACC very low, which inflates the Gordon Growth terminal value. The Exit Multiple is more conservative. I will use the lower of the two values.
*   **Selected Terminal Value: $50,040 million**

### **RISK NOTES**

1.  **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** The company's net interest income is highly sensitive to changes in global benchmark interest rates. A rapid decline in rates could compress margins and reduce profitability.
2.  **Regulatory Risk:** As a global broker, IBKR is subject to a complex and ever-changing web of regulations in numerous jurisdictions. Any adverse regulatory action could result in significant fines and reputational damage.
3.  **Competition:** The electronic brokerage industry is intensely competitive, with pressure on commissions and fees. The rise of zero-commission trading puts pressure on a key revenue stream.
4.  **Market Volatility:** While higher volatility can increase trading volumes and revenue, a severe and prolonged market downturn could lead to substantial customer defaults and credit losses.
5.  **Technology Risk:** The business is heavily reliant on its proprietary technology. Any system failures, cyber-attacks, or inability to keep pace with technological innovation could severely disrupt operations.
