### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Share Repurchase Program Execution

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company has a $5 billion share repurchase program authorized in October 2023. As of June 30, 2025, $2.3 billion remains available under this authorization, which the company can deploy to repurchase its common stock.
*   **Mechanism:** Aggressive share buybacks reduce the number of outstanding shares, which increases earnings per share (EPS). A higher EPS, assuming a constant P/E multiple, leads to a higher stock price. It also signals management's confidence that the stock is undervalued.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The company repurchases $1 billion of stock at an average price of $180/share, retiring 5.56 million shares.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The company repurchases $2.3 billion of stock at an average price of $190/share, retiring 12.1 million shares.
    *   **High Scenario:** The company completes the $2.3 billion repurchase and authorizes an additional buyback, repurchasing a total of $3.5 billion at an average price of $200/share, retiring 17.5 million shares.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+10-20%). The repurchase of a significant percentage of shares outstanding would be a considerable boost to EPS and investor confidence.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, and with the recent dividend reinstatement, appears focused on returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong free cash flow generation and a belief by management that the stock is attractively priced.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly reports on share repurchase activity in 10-Q and 10-K filings.
    *   Company announcements of any new or expanded repurchase authorizations.
    *   Free cash flow trends.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant downturn in the travel market could reduce cash flow and lead to a suspension of the buyback program.
    *   A rapid increase in the stock price could make repurchases less attractive.
    *   The company could prioritize debt repayment or acquisitions over share repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Monitor the pace of share repurchases in upcoming quarterly reports.

**2. Catalyst Title:** B2B Segment Growth and Margin Expansion

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Expedia's B2B segment, which provides travel technology and supply to other businesses, has been growing rapidly. This segment leverages the company's technology platform to drive high-margin revenue.
*   **Mechanism:** The B2B segment has higher margins than the B2C segment. As the B2B segment grows as a percentage of total revenue, it should lead to an increase in the company's overall profit margins and valuation multiple.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** B2B revenue grows 10% year-over-year.
    *   **Base Scenario:** B2B revenue grows 15% year-over-year, consistent with the first half of 2025.
    *   **High Scenario:** B2B revenue growth accelerates to 20% due to new partnerships and product offerings.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (+15-25%). Continued strong growth in this high-margin segment would demonstrate the success of the company's platform strategy and could lead to a re-rating of the stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. The B2B segment has strong momentum, but is dependent on the overall health of the travel industry.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful onboarding of new partners and continued investment in the technology platform.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   B2B segment revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth in quarterly reports.
    *   Announcements of new B2B partnerships.
    *   Management commentary on the B2B business in earnings calls.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   Increased competition in the B2B travel space.
    *   A slowdown in the global travel market could impact demand from B2B partners.
    *   Execution risks in integrating new partners.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The B2B segment is a key growth driver for the company.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Dividend Reinstatement and Growth

*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** In February 2025, Expedia reinstated its quarterly dividend at $0.40 per share. This signals a return to a more mature capital allocation policy and could attract a new class of income-oriented investors.
*   **Mechanism:** The dividend provides a direct return to shareholders and can make the stock more attractive to a broader range of investors, potentially increasing demand and the stock price. Any future increases in the dividend would further signal the company's financial strength.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 - August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The dividend remains at $0.40 per quarter.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The dividend is increased by 10% to $0.44 per quarter within the next 12 months.
    *   **High Scenario:** The dividend is increased by 20% to $0.48 per quarter within the next 12 months.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (+5-10%). While the reinstatement is positive, the current yield is relatively low. The impact will be larger if the company signals a commitment to consistent dividend growth.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The dividend has already been reinstated, and given the company's cash flow, it is likely to be maintained and potentially increased.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued strong and stable free cash flow.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly dividend announcements.
    *   Company's dividend policy statements.
    *   Free cash flow and payout ratio.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   A significant negative impact to cash flow could lead to a dividend cut.
    *   The company may choose to prioritize share buybacks or acquisitions over dividend growth.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The dividend provides a floor for the stock and is a sign of financial strength.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** "One Key" Loyalty Program Unification and Expansion

*   **Type:** Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Expedia has launched its unified loyalty program, "One Key," in the U.S. and U.K., integrating its major brands (Expedia, Hotels.com, Vrbo). This program is designed to increase customer retention and direct bookings.
*   **Mechanism:** A successful loyalty program can shift the booking mix from high-cost marketing channels to direct, lower-cost channels. This would lead to higher margins and a more stable, recurring revenue base.
*   **Timing:** August 2026 - August 2030.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** The loyalty program increases direct bookings by 2% of total bookings.
    *   **Base Scenario:** The loyalty program increases direct bookings by 5% of total bookings.
    *   **High Scenario:** The loyalty program is highly successful and increases direct bookings by 10% of total bookings.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A significant shift to direct bookings would fundamentally improve the company's profitability and competitive position.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 60%. The success of loyalty programs is not guaranteed and depends on execution and customer adoption.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful global rollout of the "One Key" program and effective marketing to drive customer engagement.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Management commentary on "One Key" adoption and performance in earnings calls.
    *   Changes in the mix of direct vs. indirect bookings.
    *   Customer repeat rates.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    *   The loyalty program may not be compelling enough to change customer behavior.
    *   Competitors may respond with more attractive loyalty offerings.
    *   Execution challenges in the global rollout.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. The success of "One Key" will take several years to become apparent.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. B2B Segment Growth:**

*   **Formula:** (B2B Revenue Growth Rate * B2B Revenue) * B2B Adjusted EBITDA Margin = Incremental B2B Adjusted EBITDA
*   **Assumptions:** B2B Revenue (2025E) = $4.5 billion; B2B Adjusted EBITDA Margin = 25%
*   **Sensitivity:** A 5% increase in B2B revenue growth (from 15% to 20%) would add $112.5 million in incremental Adjusted EBITDA. Applying a 10x EV/EBITDA multiple would imply a ~$1.1 billion increase in enterprise value, or ~7% upside to the current stock price.

**2. Share Repurchase:**

*   **Formula:** (Repurchase Amount / Average Stock Price) / Shares Outstanding = % Reduction in Share Count
*   **Assumptions:** Shares Outstanding = 124 million; Average Stock Price = $190
*   **Sensitivity:** A $2.3 billion repurchase would reduce the share count by ~12.1 million shares, or ~9.8%. This would directly increase EPS by a similar amount, which could translate to a ~10% increase in the stock price, assuming a constant P/E multiple.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Expedia are predominantly positive. The combination of an aggressive share repurchase program, the reinstatement of a dividend, and strong growth in the high-margin B2B segment provide a clear path to shareholder value creation in the next 0-12 months. While there are risks related to the broader travel market and competition, the company-specific catalysts appear to outweigh these concerns in the short term. The market signal is positive, suggesting potential for stock price appreciation.

### **9) Evidence Matrix**

| Citation | Claims/Fields Supported |
| :--- | :--- |
| 10-Q, Aug 7, 2025 | Share repurchase authorization and activity, B2B segment financial performance, recent financial results. |

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Global Recession:** A major economic downturn would significantly reduce travel demand, impacting all of Expedia's business segments and limiting its ability to generate cash for buybacks and dividends.
2.  **Intensified Competition from Google:** If Google aggressively expands its own travel booking capabilities, it could disintermediate Expedia and significantly increase customer acquisition costs.
3.  **Major Cybersecurity Breach:** A large-scale data breach could damage the company's reputation, lead to significant fines, and erode customer trust.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Based on this analysis, the recommendation is a **Buy** for Expedia Group, Inc. The most significant near-term catalyst is the continued growth and margin expansion of the B2B segment, which has the potential to drive a re-rating of the stock. Combined with the aggressive share repurchase program, there is a clear path to a **15-25%** upside in the stock price over the next 12 months. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth of the B2B segment.
