### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus operates in the government services market, which benefits from long-term drivers such as demographic trends, constrained government budgets, and the need for technology modernization. The company's backlog was $16.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, providing significant revenue visibility. Key growth areas include clinical services, particularly driven by the PACT Act which expands veteran benefits, and technology modernization for government agencies. Management has a strategic plan focused on digitally enabled customer services, the future of health, and advanced technologies, indicating a clear path for future growth.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus is actively investing in technology to enhance its service offerings. The company's strategic plan emphasizes elevating the customer experience through intelligent automation and cognitive computing, expanding clinical capabilities, and furthering its role as a technology leader for government modernization. Recent activities include the launch of Maximus Total Experience Management (TXM), an integrated digital platform. The company also makes strategic acquisitions to enhance its capabilities, such as the February 2024 acquisition of an IT vendor to bolster its workforce and support all three operating segments.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a government services provider, Maximus's R&D is not comparable to that of a technology or pharmaceutical company and is not disclosed as a separate line item. Instead, investment is embedded in capitalized software and technology-focused acquisitions. For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, the company invested $55.7 million in purchases of property, equipment, and capitalized software. The effectiveness of these investments is demonstrated by the company's ability to win technology-driven contracts and modernize government systems, a key pillar of its strategy. However, without specific R&D metrics, a direct comparison to peers is difficult.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus's ability to consistently win large, long-term government contracts suggests a highly effective sales and business development organization. The company's backlog of $16.2 billion as of September 30, 2024, is a testament to its success in a competitive bidding environment. The company highlights its expertise in navigating the complex government RFP process as a competitive advantage. Key contract wins and renewals, such as the renewal of the Contact Center Operations contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service (CMS), further demonstrate the strength of their sales efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the nine months ended June 30, 2025, Maximus reported an operating margin of 9.9%. The U.S. Federal Services segment, its largest, had a strong operating margin of 15.3% for the same period. While the Outside the U.S. segment has historically underperformed, recent divestitures and a focus on higher-margin clinical services are improving its profitability. The company is targeting a full-year operating margin of approximately 15% for its U.S. Federal Services segment and 10.5% for its U.S. Services segment in fiscal 2025, indicating healthy profitability in its core markets.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222025000040/mms-20250630.htm"] (August 7, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus is actively working to improve margins through several initiatives. The company is rebalancing its portfolio by divesting underperforming businesses in its Outside the U.S. segment, which has tempered losses and improved segment profitability. It is also focused on growing its higher-margin clinical services business and leveraging technology and automation to increase efficiency. The Maximus Forward corporate initiative is aimed at optimizing processes and simplifying the company's structure, which should also contribute to margin improvement.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222025000040/mms-20250630.htm"] (August 7, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus emphasizes its commitment to its employees, with initiatives like "Moving Our Talent Forward" to focus on internal mobility and upskilling. The company highlights its numerous awards as a top employer for diversity and veterans. However, as a large government contractor, Maximus has faced union organizing efforts and work disruptions at some U.S. locations, which is noted as a risk factor. While the company has programs in place to support its workforce, the presence of labor disputes prevents a clear "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Maximus appears stable, with long-tenured leaders in key positions. Information regarding executive compensation and director independence is incorporated by reference from the company's proxy statement, which typically outlines alignment with shareholder interests. There are no public reports of significant executive infighting or high-profile departures that would indicate poor relations. The company has a clear succession planning process outlined in its corporate governance documents.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus's corporate leadership team, as detailed on its investor relations website and in its filings, includes a broad range of experienced executives beyond the CEO, covering various functions and business segments. The company's segment reporting structure suggests that there are dedicated leadership teams for each of the three main business areas, indicating a decentralized management structure with depth. Succession planning is a stated focus of the board and management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a government contractor, Maximus is subject to rigorous cost accounting standards and regular government audits. The company's independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2024. Management's report on internal control also concluded that controls were effective. This suggests a strong system of cost analysis and accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the government services industry is the ability to navigate the complex procurement process and manage large, complex programs at scale, often under tight deadlines. Maximus has nearly 50 years of experience in this area and highlights its expertise in competitive bidding and its ability to launch large-scale operations quickly as key differentiators. The company's large and diverse backlog, and its position as an incumbent on many key contracts, create significant barriers to entry for competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategic plan, with its pillars of digital enablement, health services expansion, and technology modernization, demonstrates a clear long-range focus. The company's willingness to make strategic acquisitions, which can be dilutive in the short term, to gain new capabilities for long-term growth supports this view. Additionally, the company's ongoing investments in technology and process improvement are aimed at building a more efficient and profitable business for the future. The August 2025 earnings call also provided an early outlook for fiscal year 2026, indicating a forward-looking approach.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus generates strong cash flow from operations, reporting $515.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2024. The company has a $750 million revolving credit facility, providing ample liquidity for investments and working capital needs. While the company does issue stock for compensation, it also has a share repurchase program in place, buying back $73.1 million in stock in fiscal 2024. This indicates a financial position that does not necessitate dilutive equity financing for growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management regularly hosts quarterly earnings calls and provides detailed financial reporting through its SEC filings. The company's filings openly discuss challenges, such as the underperformance of the Outside the U.S. segment and the rationale for divestitures. The risk factors section is comprehensive, detailing potential issues like unionization efforts and contract recompetes. In the Q3 2025 earnings call, management addressed a short-term delay in cash flow transparently, explaining the cause and expected resolution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222025000040/mms-20250630.htm"] (August 7, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Maximus emphasizes its commitment to ethical conduct in its filings, with a "Standards for Business Conduct and Ethics" policy and a confidential ethics hotline. However, the company is currently involved in litigation related to a 2023 cybersecurity incident involving the MOVEit file transfer application. Additionally, Maximus received a Civil Investigation Demand from the Department of Justice in 2021 related to the Census project, for which it has accrued $8.2 million. These legal and regulatory issues, while not uncommon for a large government contractor, prevent a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222024000094/mms-20240930.htm"] (November 21, 2024), ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032220/000103222025000040/mms-20250630.htm"] (August 7, 2025)

---
Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
Maximus demonstrates significant strengths in its market position, with a long runway for growth driven by its substantial backlog and alignment with government priorities. The company has a clear strategy for development, a strong sales organization, and sound financial controls. Profitability is solid, and management is taking concrete steps to improve margins by divesting weaker businesses and focusing on higher-value services. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the outcomes of major contract recompetes, particularly with the VA and CMS, and the resolution of ongoing litigation. A successful resolution of the DOJ investigation and the MOVEit litigation without significant financial or reputational damage would be key to flipping the "No" on integrity to a "Yes." Similarly, a more detailed disclosure of R&D-like investments and their returns could improve the score on R&D effectiveness.

fisher score is 12 / 15
