### **F) Terminal Value**

**Gordon Growth Model:**
*   **Formula:** `Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)`
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Assumed to be in line with long-term inflation).
*   **Calculation:** `($95,951 * (1 + 0.025)) / (0.1051 - 0.025) = $1,226,381M`
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** `$1,226,381M / (1 + 0.1051)^5 = $742,015M`

**Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $169,658M (EBIT + D&A)
*   **Median EV/EBITDA Multiple (13-Year):** 17.73x (GuruFocus, Aug 21, 2025).
*   **Implied Terminal Value:** `$169,658M * 17.73 = $3,008,187M`
*   The Gordon Growth model results in a more conservative terminal value and will be used.
