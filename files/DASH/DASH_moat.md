### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** DoorDash benefits from a strong three-sided network effect among merchants, consumers, and Dashers. A wider selection of merchants attracts more consumers, which in turn creates more earning opportunities to attract Dashers, creating a virtuous cycle that reinforces market density and improves service levels. This flywheel is the core of its competitive advantage, driving liquidity and efficiency in the markets it serves. The company's growth in monthly active users and DashPass members demonstrates the increasing value of this network.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The number of monthly active users on DoorDash's marketplaces grew to over 42 million as of December 2024, demonstrating a growing and engaged consumer base. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   DoorDash had over 22 million members in its DashPass and Wolt+ subscription programs as of December 31, 2024, indicating a sticky user base that derives recurring value from the network. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   In 2024, 8 million people used the platform to earn a total of over $18 billion, highlighting the platform's scale in attracting and retaining delivery personnel (Dashers). (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 4 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Switching costs for consumers and Dashers are exceptionally low, as both can multi-home across competing platforms with minimal friction. For merchants, switching costs are slightly higher due to the need to integrate menus and workflows, but these are not prohibitive, as many merchants list on multiple platforms to maximize order volume. The primary lock-in is behavioral, driven by the convenience of the stored payment information and order history on the consumer side and familiarity on the merchant side. There are no significant contractual or technical barriers preventing users from switching.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The markets in which DoorDash operates are characterized by "shifting user preferences" and it is "relatively easy to switch between offerings." (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until terminated by either party with 7 to 30 days advance notice and typically do not include exclusivity clauses. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Dashers are independent contractors and "have the ability to decline offers or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity provisions with Dashers." (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** DoorDash achieves a cost advantage through its operational scale and technological efficiency, particularly in logistics and order batching, which helps lower the fulfillment cost per order. This efficiency allows for competitive pricing for consumers and viable earnings for Dashers, creating a scale-based cost advantage that is difficult for smaller competitors to replicate. While the company has demonstrated improving gross margins, intense competition and the need for ongoing investment in marketing and promotions limit the translation of these unit cost advantages into sustained, high profitability.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   GAAP gross profit as a percentage of Marketplace GOV increased from 5.8% in 2023 to 6.2% in 2024, suggesting improving unit economics at scale. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Contribution Profit as a percentage of Marketplace GOV increased from 3.7% in 2023 to 4.3% in 2024, indicating better leverage on direct costs associated with generating and fulfilling orders. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The company faces intense competition which may require it to "reduce our commission rate or make pricing concessions," limiting the ability to fully leverage its cost advantages. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 3 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** DoorDash has established strong brand recognition in the U.S. and is building the Wolt brand internationally, which helps in attracting users organically. Its intellectual property portfolio, including patents in logistics and optimization, provides a modest technological barrier. However, the core service is difficult to differentiate through IP alone, and brand strength is vulnerable to negative publicity related to service quality or labor practices.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company held 244 issued U.S. patents and 25 patents in non-U.S. jurisdictions, with numerous applications pending, primarily in logistics and optimization technologies. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The company held 56 registered trademarks in the United States and 194 in non-U.S. jurisdictions as of December 31, 2024, protecting its "DoorDash" and "Wolt" brands. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The company acknowledges that its brand can be adversely affected by "complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers... even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents." (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 3 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** DoorDash's primary competitive advantage stems from its market density and efficient scale in the geographies it serves. The dense network of merchants, consumers, and Dashers in established markets creates a logistical footprint that is difficult and costly for new entrants to replicate, allowing for faster delivery times and better service. This scale makes it unattractive for smaller players to compete effectively on a per-unit basis in markets where DoorDash has a strong presence.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company operates in over 30 countries, indicating a broad and established geographic footprint that leverages economies of scale. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The company's business model relies on achieving local network effects; "The increase in merchants attracts more consumers... and the increase in consumers attracts more merchants," which creates a defensible scale in local markets. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Competitors with greater "established geographic footprints and infrastructure" pose a significant threat, highlighting the importance of scaled distribution networks. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 4 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** DoorDash collects vast amounts of data on local commerce, including consumer preferences, merchant sales, and delivery logistics, creating a significant data asset. This data is used to optimize its logistics algorithms, personalize the consumer experience, and provide insights to merchant partners. While the data provides a competitive edge, its advantage is constrained by the fact that competitors collect similar datasets, and data's value diminishes over time.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company is making significant investments in technology, "including enhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and batching algorithms," which are all data-driven initiatives. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The company offers advertising services that help merchants and consumer packaged goods companies "increase consumer engagement and drive incremental revenue," an offering built upon its large dataset of consumer purchasing behavior. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Laws and regulations related to data privacy and protection are evolving and could restrict the company's ability to use its data, potentially limiting this advantage. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 3 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** DoorDash is expanding beyond its core marketplace to build a broader commerce platform with services like Drive (white-label delivery), DashMart, and merchant tools. This creates an ecosystem that increases merchant reliance and stickiness. However, these ecosystem services are still in a relatively early stage and contribute a smaller portion of overall revenue compared to the core marketplace.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company offers a "Commerce Platform," which includes DoorDash Drive, a white-label delivery fulfillment service for merchants to use on their own channels. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The Commerce Platform also provides services to "help merchants establish online ordering, build branded mobile apps, enable tableside order and pay, and improve customer support." (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The company's self-operated convenience and grocery businesses, DashMart and Wolt Market, represent an expansion of the ecosystem but also introduce new operational complexities and risks. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The regulatory landscape for DoorDash is more of a risk than a protective barrier. While complex licensing and regulations for delivery of certain goods (like alcohol) can create minor barriers to entry, the more significant regulatory focus is on worker classification, price controls, and antitrust concerns, which threaten to increase costs and limit operational flexibility. The passage of favorable legislation like California's Proposition 22 provides some regulatory stability in a key market but remains a point of legal contention and is not guaranteed to be replicated elsewhere.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations governing issues such as worker classification, commissions and fees, and consumer protection, which are often "complex and subject to varying interpretations." (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Proposition 22 in California, which preserves the independent contractor status for Dashers, was upheld by the state Supreme Court in July 2024 but remains a contentious model and demonstrates the legal challenges in this area. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Some jurisdictions have introduced "price control measures on local commerce platforms and established minimum earnings standards," which can negatively impact the company's pricing methodologies and profitability. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** DoorDash operates an asset-light model, as it does not own the primary fulfillment assets (vehicles) or the merchant inventory. The main capital requirements are for technology development and marketing, not heavy physical infrastructure. This low capital intensity facilitates market entry and competition, and therefore does not represent a significant competitive advantage for DoorDash.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The company's primary assets are its technology platform and brand, not physical infrastructure like delivery fleets or warehouses, distinguishing it from traditional logistics companies.
*   Capital expenditures consist primarily of capitalized software, equipment for merchants, and office leasehold improvements, which are modest relative to revenue. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   The business model relies on independent contractors (Dashers) who use their own vehicles, shifting the capital cost of delivery assets away from the company. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 1 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** A significant portion of DoorDash's revenue is transactional and lacks long-term contractual visibility. However, the growing DashPass and Wolt+ membership base, with over 22 million subscribers, provides a layer of recurring revenue and improves predictability. While individual orders are unpredictable, the large and growing subscriber base offers some stability and visibility into future revenue streams.

**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   Revenue is primarily generated on a per-order basis, which is transactional and lacks long-term contractual commitments from most users. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   As of December 31, 2024, DoorDash had over 22 million members in its DashPass and Wolt+ subscription programs, which generate recurring membership fees recognized on a ratable basis. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
*   Merchant agreements are typically terminable with 7-30 days notice, providing limited long-term revenue assurance from any single partner. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

**Score:** 2 / 5

### **Aggregation**
**Weighted Score Calculation:**
(4 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (3 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (1 * 0.04) + (2 * 0.02) = 0.72 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.36 + 0.40 + 0.30 + 0.16 + 0.12 + 0.04 + 0.04 = **2.89**

**Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 57.8 / 100

### **Mapping**
A weighted score of 57.8 falls within the 50-69.9 range, which maps to a final moat rating of 3.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is approximately 5-8 years. This is based on the strength of DoorDash's localized network effects and distribution scale, which are its most durable advantages. However, the industry is characterized by intense competition, low switching costs, and significant regulatory risk, which could erode these advantages over the medium term. Key events to monitor include the implementation of new worker classification laws in major markets and the potential for consolidation among competitors.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Regulatory Changes:** Widespread reclassification of Dashers as employees in key markets would significantly increase operational costs, forcing price hikes that could destroy the platform's value proposition for consumers and merchants. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
2.  **Intensified Competition:** A major competitor, such as Uber Eats, could successfully leverage a bundled subscription model (e.g., with ride-sharing) or aggressive pricing to capture significant market share, weakening DoorDash's network effects and pricing power. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).
3.  **Merchant Disintermediation:** Large enterprise partners or grocery chains could vertically integrate their own delivery services or partner exclusively with a competitor, removing key selection from the DoorDash marketplace and weakening its consumer appeal. (DoorDash, Inc. 2024 Form 10-K, February 14, 2025).

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Marketplace GOV Growth:** A sustained deceleration relative to peers could indicate market share loss and weakening network effects.
*   **Contribution Margin:** A decline in this metric would suggest a deterioration in unit economics due to competitive pressure or rising fulfillment costs.
*   **DashPass/Wolt+ Membership Growth and Churn:** Stagnation or high churn in the subscriber base would signal a weakening of customer loyalty and recurring revenue.
*   **Dasher Supply/Demand Balance:** An increase in Dasher incentives as a percentage of GOV may indicate difficulty in retaining a sufficient supply of delivery personnel.
*   **Consumer Order Frequency:** A decline in orders per monthly active user could signal reduced engagement or multi-homing.
*   **Sales & Marketing as % of Revenue:** An increasing trend could indicate a need to spend more to acquire new users, pointing to a less efficient or more competitive market.
*   **Revenue from New Verticals (Grocery, Convenience):** Slow growth in these areas could indicate a failure to diversify beyond the highly competitive restaurant delivery market.
*   **Litigation and Regulatory Reserves:** An increase in financial reserves for legal matters could signal mounting regulatory headwinds.

### **Short Verdict Paragraph**
DoorDash possesses a moderate moat, earning a rating of 3 out of 5. Its primary competitive advantages are rooted in strong, localized network effects and an efficient distribution scale, which are difficult for smaller players to replicate in established markets. However, the moat's durability is constrained by extremely low switching costs for consumers and Dashers, intense and well-capitalized competition, and significant, persistent regulatory risks surrounding worker classification and price controls. A downgrade would be warranted if key regulatory challenges materialize, leading to structurally higher costs, or if competitors succeed in durably eroding DoorDash's market share and weakening its network density. Conversely, a successful expansion into new, profitable verticals and the strengthening of its subscription ecosystem could widen the moat over time.

moat rating is 3 / 5
