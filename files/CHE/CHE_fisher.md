**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chemed operates in two distinct, growing markets. Its VITAS segment is a leader in the hospice care industry, which is projected to grow significantly due to an aging population and increased prevalence of chronic diseases. The global hospice market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 8% to 9% through 2033. Chemed's Roto-Rooter segment is a leading provider of plumbing and drain cleaning services, a market driven by aging infrastructure, new construction, and the essential, non-discretionary nature of the services. The global sewer and drain cleaning services market is forecast to grow at a CAGR of approximately 6.0%. Both segments operate in large, fragmented industries providing ample opportunity for continued organic growth and bolt-on acquisitions.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chemed's primary growth development strategy is through acquisitions. In 2024, the Roto-Rooter segment acquired three franchises for a total of $12.4 million and the VITAS segment acquired hospice operations from Covenant Care for $85.0 million. This demonstrates a continued commitment to deploying capital to expand its footprint and service capabilities in its core segments. Roto-Rooter also analyzes opportunities for new services, while VITAS focuses on expanding its network and palliative care offerings.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a service-based company, Chemed does not have traditional R&D in the context of product development. The company's 2024 10-K states, "research and development expenditures from continuing operations have not been nor are they expected to be material." Investment is directed toward process improvement and acquisitions rather than formal R&D.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Roto-Rooter possesses one of the most recognized brand names in its industry, which is a significant competitive advantage in a fragmented market. VITAS's success is heavily dependent on its relationships with referral sources like physicians, hospitals, and long-term care facilities. The company's scale as one of the nation's largest hospice providers suggests an effective, established network for generating patient admissions. The primary customer for VITAS is the U.S. government (Medicare), which accounted for over 90% of its revenue, indicating a focus on maintaining regulatory and reimbursement relationships rather than traditional sales.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the full year 2024, Chemed reported income from operations of $366.5 million on revenues of $2.431 billion, resulting in an operating margin of 15.1%. This margin is down from 16.1% in 2022 but up from 15.0% in 2023. These margins demonstrate consistent and strong profitability, especially for a service-based business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chemed's profitability is highly dependent on managing service costs and navigating reimbursement rates, particularly in the VITAS segment. For VITAS, profitability is "largely dependent upon [its] ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients," as it is paid on a per diem basis. For Roto-Rooter, competition is based on factors including pricing and efficiency. Both segments focus on operational efficiency to maintain margins; however, the 10-K does not detail specific, new company-wide margin improvement programs.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes a "Human Capital Resources" section that emphasizes employee safety, training, and retention. It details specific safety programs at both VITAS and Roto-Rooter, a focus on a "promote-from-within culture" at Roto-Rooter, and bonus programs at VITAS to aid retention during healthcare worker shortages. The company states a commitment to respecting employees' rights to join labor organizations. While these disclosures are positive, there is no external, verifiable data to confirm "outstanding" relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Chemed exhibits significant stability and tenure. Kevin J. McNamara has been President and CEO since 1994 and 2001, respectively. Spencer S. Lee, EVP of Chemed and CEO of Roto-Rooter, has been in his role since 1999. Nicholas M. Westfall has been CEO of VITAS and an EVP of Chemed since 2016. This long tenure among key leaders suggests a stable and effective executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chemed operates on a decentralized basis, with dedicated management teams for its two distinct segments, VITAS and Roto-Rooter. The corporate office, including the CEO and CFO, focuses on strategic planning, capital allocation, and oversight. The 10-K lists key executive officers for the parent company and notes that the segment heads (Spencer S. Lee at Roto-Rooter and Nicholas M. Westfall at VITAS) are also Executive Vice Presidents of Chemed, indicating a layer of management with both corporate and operational responsibility.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chemed's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. Management's own report also concluded that internal controls were effective. There is no mention of material weaknesses or significant deficiencies.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For Roto-Rooter, its nationally recognized brand, built since 1935, provides a significant competitive advantage in a highly fragmented market of local and regional players. For VITAS, its scale as one of the nation's largest hospice providers is a key differentiator. The hospice industry is subject to complex regulation, including Certificate of Need laws in some states; VITAS's experience and scale provide an advantage in navigating this environment and establishing the referral networks crucial for patient admissions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's capital allocation strategy prioritizes shareholder returns through consistent share repurchases and dividends, supplemented by strategic acquisitions. In 2024, the company repurchased over $300 million of its own stock. While acquisitions in both segments show a commitment to long-term growth, the substantial and consistent buybacks suggest a balanced approach that also emphasizes immediate shareholder returns over aggressive, large-scale reinvestment that might suppress near-term profits.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Chemed has a strong history of returning capital to shareholders, not raising it through equity issuance. In 2024, the company repurchased 588,235 shares. The company's 2024 10-K shows a consistent reduction in shares outstanding over the last several years. With a strong balance sheet and access to a credit facility, the company is well-positioned to fund operations and acquisitions without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings, such as the 10-K, provide a detailed and forthright discussion of the numerous risks and regulatory challenges facing its businesses, particularly the VITAS segment. The "Risk Factors" section is extensive and covers competition, dependency on Medicare, regulatory scrutiny, and labor shortages. This level of disclosure, which is consistent over time, demonstrates a willingness to openly discuss challenges with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The VITAS segment has a history of significant regulatory scrutiny. In October 2017, Chemed and VITAS agreed to pay $75 million to resolve a Department of Justice lawsuit alleging violations of the False Claims Act related to billing for ineligible patients and inflated levels of care between 2002 and 2013. In connection with this, VITAS entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General (OIG), which concluded on June 22, 2023. While the company denied wrongdoing and has completed the CIA, this major settlement prevents an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19584/000156276225000038/che-20241231x10k.htm) (February 28, 2025), [https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chemed-corp-and-vitas-hospice-services-agree-pay-75-million-resolve-false-claims-act](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/chemed-corp-and-vitas-hospice-services-agree-pay-75-million-resolve-false-claims-act) (October 30, 2017)

**Synthesis:**

Chemed Corporation scores well on many of Fisher's points, demonstrating leadership in two distinct, essential service industries with long-term growth runways. The company's strengths lie in its stable and tenured management, strong brand recognition in Roto-Rooter, significant scale in VITAS, and excellent financial controls. Furthermore, its robust financial position allows for growth and shareholder returns without equity dilution. The primary negatives are a lack of traditional R&D (which is expected for its industries), a balanced approach to growth that prioritizes shareholder returns alongside reinvestment, and a significant blemish on its record from the 2017 False Claims Act settlement. The score would most likely change in the next 12-24 months based on VITAS's ability to operate without further major regulatory actions, which would be evidence to flip the "Integrity" question to "Yes". Additionally, a more aggressive acquisition strategy or a clearly articulated plan for organic margin expansion could change the scores for "Long-Range Profit Outlook" and "Margin Improvement Actions".

**fisher score is 11 / 15**
