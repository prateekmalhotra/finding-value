**1) Network Effects**
- **Reasoning:** Network effects are not a significant driver of value for a pest control company. The value of the service to a customer is not materially enhanced by the number of other customers on the network. While there are some minor benefits to route density, this is more of a cost and distribution advantage than a network effect.
- **Evidence:**
    - The business model is based on providing a service to individual residential and commercial customers. (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 10-K), Feb 13, 2025).
- **Score:** 1 / 5

**2) Switching Costs**
- **Reasoning:** Switching costs for customers are moderate. While customers can technically switch providers easily, the recurring nature of the service, the hassle of finding a new provider, and the potential for service disruptions create some stickiness. The company's large base of customer contracts, valued as an intangible asset, points to this.
- **Evidence:**
    - As of March 31, 2025, the company reported customer contracts as an intangible asset with a net value of USD 375.8 million. (Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Apr 24, 2025).
    - The majority of unearned revenue is recognized over a period of five years or less, which indicates some longer-term contracts. (Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Apr 24, 2025).
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
- **Reasoning:** Rollins likely benefits from scale-driven cost advantages in areas like purchasing (chemicals, vehicles), marketing, and back-office functions. Its route density can also lead to lower travel time and fuel costs per customer. A gross margin of over 50% is indicative of a strong cost structure.
- **Evidence:**
    - Gross margin was a healthy 51.4% in the first quarter of 2025. (Rollins, Inc. (ROL) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Apr 24, 2025).
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
- **Reasoning:** Rollins has a portfolio of well-established brands, including Orkin, which command a degree of trust and recognition in the market. This brand equity is a significant intangible asset. The company has a substantial amount of its assets in trademarks and tradenames.
- **Evidence:**
    - As of March 31, 2025, the company reported trademarks and tradenames as an intangible asset with a net value of USD 150.5 million. (Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Apr 24, 2025).
    - Rollins, Inc. provides pest and termite control services to residential and commercial customers in the United States, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, Europe, and Africa. (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 10-K), Feb 13, 2025).
- **Score:** 4 / 5

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
- **Reasoning:** Rollins' extensive network of branches and technicians across a wide geographic area creates a significant distribution advantage. This scale makes it difficult for smaller competitors to match the company's reach and service density. The company's growth through acquisitions further enhances this scale.
- **Evidence:**
    - The company has over 10,000 employees and operates globally. (Annual Report for Fiscal Year Ending December 31, 2024 (Form 10-K), Feb 13, 2025).
    - In the first quarter of 2025, the company invested USD 27.2 million in acquisitions. (Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Apr 24, 2025).
- **Score:** 4 / 5

**6) Data Advantage**
- **Reasoning:** Rollins likely has a large dataset on pest trends, customer behavior, and service effectiveness. However, there is no clear evidence that this data is being used to create a significant, durable competitive advantage. The score is a conservative inference based on the scale of operations.
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
- **Reasoning:** The company's business model is a direct-to-customer service model. There is no evidence of a third-party ecosystem or platform that would create a competitive advantage.
- **Score:** 0 / 5

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
- **Reasoning:** The pest control industry is subject to various federal, state, and local regulations regarding pesticide use and disposal. While these regulations create a barrier to entry for new, inexperienced competitors, they are not insurmountable for well-capitalized firms.
- **Evidence:**
    - The company is working with several local governments in California regarding compliance with environmental regulations governing the management of hazardous waste and pesticide disposal. (Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Apr 24, 2025).
- **Score:** 2 / 5

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
- **Reasoning:** The business requires a significant fleet of vehicles and specialized equipment, but the capital intensity is not prohibitive. The assets are not highly specific and could be repurposed, but the scale of the fleet is a barrier to entry.
- **Evidence:**
    - Capital expenditures for the first quarter of 2025 were USD 6.8 million. (Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Apr 24, 2025).
- **Score:** 3 / 5

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
- **Reasoning:** A significant portion of Rollins' revenue is recurring, stemming from ongoing service contracts with both residential and commercial customers. This provides a high degree of revenue visibility. The company's organic growth in its recurring commercial business is strong.
- **Evidence:**
    - The organic growth rate on the recurring base of commercial business grew at nearly 10%. (Rollins, Inc. (ROL) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Apr 24, 2025).
- **Score:** 4 / 5

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (1 * 0.18) + (3 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (4 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.45 + 0.45 + 0.48 + 0.40 + 0.20 + 0.00 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.08 = 2.48.

The raw weighted score is 2.48, which, when scaled to 100, is 59.6.

### Mapping
- **Weighted Score:** 59.6 / 100
- **Mapping to Moat Rating:** 50 <= 59.6 < 70, which corresponds to a moat rating of 3.

### Moat Duration Justification
The company's moat is primarily derived from its strong brands, extensive distribution network, and the recurring nature of its revenue. These advantages are durable and not easily replicated. I estimate a moat duration of 10-15 years. This could be eroded by a significant shift in pest control technology or a major reputational event.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Technological Disruption:** A new, more effective, and cheaper pest control technology could disrupt the industry and erode Rollins' pricing power.
2.  **Reputational Damage:** A major incident related to pesticide misuse or environmental contamination could significantly damage the company's brands. (Rollins, Inc. Q1 2025 Form 10-Q, Apr 24, 2025).
3.  **Increased Competition:** A well-capitalized new entrant or a consolidation of smaller players could challenge Rollins' market share and pricing.

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Organic Revenue Growth:** A sustained drop below the 7-8% target could indicate market share loss.
2.  **Gross Margins:** A decline in gross margins could signal increased competition and pricing pressure.
3.  **Customer Churn/Retention:** An increase in customer churn would weaken the switching cost advantage.
4.  **Acquisition Pace and multiples:** A slowdown in acquisitions or an increase in multiples paid could signal a more competitive M&A environment.
5.  **Brand Awareness Studies:** A decline in brand recognition would indicate a weakening of intangible assets.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Rollins, Inc. has a solid, narrow moat, justifying a 3/5 rating. Its primary advantages are its well-known brands (Intangible Assets), extensive service network (Distribution & Efficient Scale), and high percentage of recurring revenue (Customer Contracts). These factors create a stable business with predictable cash flows. The moat is not wider because the company lacks strong network effects or significant technological or regulatory barriers to entry. A sustained decline in organic growth or margins would be the primary evidence that could lead to a lower rating.

moat rating is 3 / 5
