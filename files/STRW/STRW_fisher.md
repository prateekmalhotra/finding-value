**Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed.**
Strawberry Fields REIT, Inc. (STRW), August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K filed March 13, 2025, and Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript dated May 11, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** STRW is positioned to benefit from strong demographic tailwinds in the skilled nursing industry. The U.S. Census projects the population over 65 will almost double between 2020 and 2060, which should increase demand for skilled nursing services. Concurrently, the number of skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) has declined over the past two decades, creating a supply/demand imbalance that favors facility owners. The company's strategy focuses on acquiring additional healthcare properties, primarily SNFs, in a highly fragmented market, which provides significant consolidation opportunities. This industry backdrop, combined with STRW's active acquisition pipeline, supports the potential for a sizable increase in rental revenue for several years.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to growth through acquisitions, which is the primary form of "development" for a REIT. Since January 2019, STRW has acquired 59 properties for approximately $414.0 million. In 2024 alone, the company acquired $130.3 million in properties, increasing its facility count from 109 to 124. Management commentary from the Q1 2025 earnings call reinforces this focus, stating they are "working diligently on some deals and expect that number to be closer to $100 million by the end of Q2." This consistent and recently accelerated acquisition activity shows a clear determination to expand the company's rental revenue base.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a REIT, STRW does not have a formal Research and Development (R&D) department in the traditional sense. Its equivalent is the effectiveness of its investment underwriting and deal sourcing process. The company states it employs a "thorough investment underwriting process based on careful analysis and due diligence" and leverages its management team's industry relationships to source off-market opportunities. The significant portfolio growth—from 97 properties at year-end 2023 to an expected 130+ during 2025—at seemingly attractive yields suggests this process is effective. However, without specific metrics on deal pipeline conversion, return on investment vs. underwriting projections, or a peer comparison of underwriting costs, it is difficult to definitively assess its effectiveness relative to its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE3XhV1CnFGP61yhAB98bcFa8dkvw4dBZs7a05ket_R10QSLanT1-We-SRqyGkseMrsNi6VOhuXYLYTZX-Y4BYZPnSeUnTq0WElpcfaYIpv9vmDdZzTaQo8_CYixa16dZWAexAsbvOa8JKqXakAEHIBvv30wDMFiPVx5g5uwaylCy6RxpclCW69zkAB0qZ8_wwIunjavv6MWK9ADGoKjZTf9702YWVaf-mpeu8=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE3XhV1CnFGP61yhAB98bcFa8dkvw4dBZs7a05ket_R10QSLanT1-We-SRqyGkseMrsNi6VOhuXYLYTZX-Y4BYZPnSeUnTq0WElpcfaYIpv9vmDdZzTaQo8_CYixa16dZWAexAsbvOa8JKqXakAEHIBvv30wDMFiPVx5g5uwaylCy6RxpclCW69zkAB0qZ8_wwIunjavv6MWK9ADGoKjZTf9702YWVaf-mpeu8=) (March 4, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a triple-net REIT, the "sales organization" is its ability to acquire properties and secure long-term tenants. STRW's portfolio was 100% leased as of December 31, 2024, under leases with a weighted-average remaining term of 7.2 years. Management has a stated strategy of leveraging existing and developing new operator relationships, and it successfully grew its tenant base from ten operators to forty in 2024. The company’s ability to consistently source and close acquisitions, such as the $87.5 million, 8-facility Missouri deal in December 2024 and the $24 million Kansas deal in January 2025, demonstrates a highly effective acquisition and leasing function.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE3XhV1CnFGP61yhAB98bcFa8dkvw4dBZs7a05ket_R10QSLanT1-We-SRqyGkseMrsNi6VOhuXYLYTZX-Y4BYZPnSeUnTq0WElpcfaYIpv9vmDdZzTaQo8_CYixa16dZWAexAsbvOa8JKqXakAEHIBvv30wDMFiPVx5g5uwaylCy6RxpclCW69zkAB0qZ8_wwIunjavv6MWK9ADGoKjZTf9702YWVaf-mpeu8=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE3XhV1CnFGP61yhAB98bcFa8dkvw4dBZs7a05ket_R10QSLanT1-We-SRqyGkseMrsNi6VOhuXYLYTZX-Y4BYZPnSeUnTq0WElpcfaYIpv9vmDdZzTaQo8_CYixa16dZWAexAsbvOa8JKqXakAEHIBvv30wDMFiPVx5g5uwaylCy6RxpclCW69zkAB0qZ8_wwIunjavv6MWK9ADGoKjZTf9702YWVaf-mpeu8=) (March 4, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Strawberry Fields REIT reported rental revenues of $117.1 million and net income attributable to common stockholders of $4.1 million, resulting in a net profit margin of approximately 3.5%. However, net income for REITs is significantly impacted by non-cash depreciation. A more common industry metric, Funds From Operations (FFO), was $60.2 million for the same period, implying a much healthier FFO margin of 51.4%. Adjusted FFO (AFFO), which management uses to guide its dividend policy, was $55.8 million, for an AFFO margin of 47.7%. These FFO and AFFO margins indicate strong profitability from its rental operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's primary mechanisms for maintaining and improving margins are built into its business model. Most of its triple-net leases have annual rent escalators averaging 2.8%, providing a predictable organic growth stream. Margin improvement is primarily driven by accretive acquisitions, where the yield on a newly acquired property is higher than the company's cost of capital. The company is also focused on refinancing debt to manage interest expense, a key component of profitability; for example, it has actively issued bonds on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange and recently offered to exchange higher-coupon Series D bonds for lower-coupon Series A bonds.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, Strawberry Fields REIT had only 9 full-time employees, all non-union, and considers its employee relations to be satisfactory. However, the critical labor issue for STRW lies with its tenants, the operators of its healthcare facilities, as labor is a primary expense and risk in the SNF industry. The company's 10-K acknowledges the healthcare industry faces significant labor pressures, which could adversely affect its tenants' ability to make rent payments. There is no specific, verifiable evidence available in the filings or recent news to assess the quality of labor relations within the facilities of its key tenants, such as Infinity Healthcare.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior management team, led by Chairman and CEO Moishe Gubin, appears stable and has a long track record in the skilled nursing industry. The management team is small and concentrated, with Mr. Gubin, CFO Greg Flamion, and CIO Jeffrey Bajtner leading the company. The significant related-party transactions with entities controlled by CEO Gubin and Director Michael Blisko suggest a very close and aligned relationship among the key executives and directors. While this alignment can be a strength, it also concentrates decision-making power and presents potential governance conflicts of interest. Without further evidence on board dynamics or succession planning, it is difficult to classify executive relations as "outstanding" in a conventional sense.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's management team is lean, consisting of CEO Moishe Gubin, CFO Greg Flamion, and CIO Jeffrey Bajtner. Mr. Gubin is central to the company's operations, deal flow, and key tenant relationships, having over 25 years of experience in the industry. While the team has demonstrated significant expertise, the 10-K and other public disclosures do not provide information on succession planning or highlight a broader bench of senior managers beyond the three named executives. This suggests a significant "key person" risk centered on the CEO, and a lack of demonstrated management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's report on internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024, concluded that the company maintained effective internal control. The accompanying report from the independent registered public accounting firm, Hacker, Johnson & Smith PA, did not identify any material weaknesses. The company's financial reporting provides a clear breakdown of revenues and expenses, and the MD&A section offers detailed analysis of year-over-year changes. There is no history of major restatements noted in the filing. These factors suggest that the company's cost analysis and accounting controls are adequate and professionally audited.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive clue is STRW's relationship with Infinity Healthcare, the operator affiliated with its CEO and a director. This provides "unmatched insight into operating trends" and "operating flexibility with regard to evaluating potential new acquisitions or better understanding of operational issues." Another clue is the company's focus on off-market acquisition opportunities sourced through its management's deep industry network, which allows it to acquire assets at potentially more attractive valuations than broadly marketed deals. Additionally, operating in states with Certificate of Need (CON) laws provides a significant barrier to entry for new competition, protecting the value of its existing facilities. These factors suggest a distinct competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's strategy is explicitly focused on long-term value creation through the acquisition and triple-net leasing of healthcare properties. The company's rapid growth through acquisitions, funded by raising both debt and equity, demonstrates a clear reinvestment narrative aimed at building a larger, more durable portfolio rather than maximizing short-term earnings per share. In the Q4 2024 earnings call, management provided a 2025 base rent projection of around $130 million, up significantly from $104 million in 2024, indicating a focus on continued growth. While the company pays a regular dividend, its AFFO payout ratio of 49.5% at year-end 2024 suggests a balanced approach that retains significant capital for reinvestment.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company actively uses equity to fund growth. In December 2024, it raised gross proceeds of approximately $35 million in a public offering of common stock. It also established an at-the-market (ATM) program in August 2024, selling $3.2 million worth of shares under it during the year. While the company also uses debt, its stated growth strategy explicitly relies on accessing the capital markets. Given the rapid pace of acquisitions, it is highly likely that the company will continue to issue equity, which will cause dilution. While this may be accretive to FFO per share if investments are made wisely, it is not funding growth without resorting to equity financing.
**Answer:** No

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reviewing the Q1 2025 and Q4 2024 earnings call transcripts, management's discussion is straightforward and focused on financial results and growth initiatives. The company's 10-K filing openly discloses significant risks, including its high dependence on related-party tenants and ongoing legal proceedings involving affiliates of the CEO. The detailed disclosure of these potentially negative factors in its primary filing demonstrates a willingness to be transparent about challenges. There is no evidence of management avoiding difficult topics in its public communications.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are significant governance red flags that prevent an answer of "Yes." As of March 13, 2025, approximately 55.2% of the company's annualized base rent comes from tenants affiliated with CEO Moishe Gubin and Director Michael Blisko. This level of related-party dealing, while disclosed, creates inherent potential conflicts of interest between management's duties to the REIT and their interests in the operating companies. Furthermore, the company and its affiliates (including the CEO) are involved in ongoing litigation related to prior property acquisitions, with claims of fraud and breach of contract. While the company states the claims are without merit, the existence of such serious allegations against its leadership prevents the conclusion of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1782430/000149315225010144/form10-k.htm) (March 13, 2025)

Synthesis (5–7 sentences):
Strawberry Fields REIT scores positively on its growth potential, operational execution, and profitability, underpinned by strong demographic trends in the skilled nursing sector and a proven acquisition-led strategy. The company's deep industry relationships, particularly with its affiliated operator, provide a distinct competitive advantage in sourcing and managing assets. However, this strength is also its greatest weakness, creating significant governance concerns due to extensive related-party transactions and a high concentration of power with the CEO. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the diversification of its tenant base away from related parties and the resolution of the outstanding litigation against its CEO. A favorable settlement or dismissal of the lawsuit, coupled with several large acquisitions leased to unaffiliated third-party operators, would be the most compelling evidence to flip the "No" answers on Executive Relations and Integrity to "Yes". Conversely, an adverse legal judgment or increased tenant concentration would further solidify these concerns.

fisher score is 9 / 15
