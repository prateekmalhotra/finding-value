Sow Good Inc. (SOWG), August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good operates in the nascent freeze-dried candy market, which it believes is "poised for exponential growth." However, the company's sales have recently collapsed, with revenue decreasing 78% from $11.4 million in Q1 2024 to $2.5 million in Q1 2025. Management attributes this directly to "significantly reduced demand due in large part to increased competitive and market pressure by large competitors," which "caused the loss of significant customers." This recent, severe downturn calls into question the company's ability to participate in any potential market growth.
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a stated growth strategy to "Expand Our Product Offering" into adjacent categories like yogurt snacks and jerky. The company demonstrated this capability by launching its "Crunch Cream" line of freeze-dried ice cream within nine weeks of ideation. Furthermore, Sow Good has invested heavily in capacity, building six proprietary freeze driers with the ability to make another six operational by the end of 2025 if needed. This indicates a clear commitment to future product development and manufacturing scale.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial statements do not disclose specific Research & Development expenditures, making a quantitative analysis impossible. The company does state that its "innovative product-development process" and integrated "test kitchen" allowed it to take the Crunch Cream line from inception to production in a few months. However, without specific data on R&D spending, success rates, or a product pipeline, effectiveness cannot be verified.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025)

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good has established a national retail footprint in approximately 3,000 stores, including major chains like Kroger, Albertsons, and 7/11. However, the sales organization has proven ineffective at defending this position. Management recently disclosed the loss of significant customers due to competitors' ability to "limit our current and future customers from purchasing our products or reducing our shelf space." This resulted in a 78% year-over-year revenue decline in the most recent quarter. Customer concentration is also dangerously high, with three customers accounting for 83.2% of revenue in Q1 2025.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a healthy gross profit margin, which improved to 45% in the three months ended March 31, 2025, up from 41% in the same period in 2024. However, high operating expenses mean the company is not profitable overall. It posted a net loss of $2.6 million for the quarter and a net loss of $3.7 million for the full fiscal year 2024. A worthwhile profit margin must ultimately translate to net profitability, which has not been achieved.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's core strategy for margin expansion is to "Vertically Integrate Our Operations." This involves leveraging its in-house manufacturing, which it claims is highly efficient, to gain fixed-cost leverage as production volumes increase. Management has also internalized functions like engineering, branding, and marketing to control costs. The improvement in gross margin from 41% to 45% year-over-year in the latest quarter, despite a collapse in sales, provides concrete evidence that its cost-of-goods-sold management is having a positive effect.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 10-K, Sow Good states it provides employees with "a living wage, an energizing working environment, full benefits, and stock options to every employee." The company also reports that none of its 86 full-time employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and that it has never experienced a work stoppage or labor dispute. While these statements are positive, they are self-reported and not substantiated by independent sources.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is led by its co-founders, a husband-and-wife team, which suggests stability at the highest level. However, the company's filings detail numerous and significant related-party transactions, including leasing its primary facility from an entity owned by the Executive Chairman and taking loans from executives and directors. While disclosed, this complex web of insider dealings creates potential conflicts of interest and does not meet the standard for "outstanding" executive relations, which implies a more independent governance structure.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company appears to be highly dependent on its two co-founders, CEO Claudia Goldfarb and Executive Chairman Ira Goldfarb. A significant red flag is the high turnover in the Chief Financial Officer role. The 2024 10-K notes that CFO Keith Terreri resigned on March 2, 2024, after having only been appointed on November 13, 2023. The most recent 10-Q lists an Interim Chief Financial Officer. Such rapid turnover in a critical executive position suggests a lack of stability and depth in the management team.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, in the report included in the 2024 10-K, issued an opinion with a "Going Concern Uncertainty" paragraph. The auditor explicitly states that the company's recurring losses from operations "raise substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern." While there is no reported material weakness in internal controls, this is the most severe warning an auditor can issue about a company's financial viability, indicating cost structures are not controlled well enough to sustain the business.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Sow Good has claimed its "proprietary technology" and custom-built freeze driers represent a "meaningful barrier to entry." However, recent performance proves this barrier was ineffective. Per the Q1 2025 10-Q, larger competitors entered the market and successfully used their "market status and marketing spend to limit our current and future customers from purchasing our products or reducing our shelf space." This demonstrates that in the consumer-packaged goods industry, scale, distribution relationships, and marketing power are more critical competitive advantages than this company's manufacturing process.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company demonstrates a long-range outlook through its significant capital investments. Despite current losses, it has built out six large freeze driers and has six more ready to be made operational. In May 2024, the company entered into a lease for a 324,000-square-foot facility, a massive expansion of its physical footprint. These actions, which prioritize building capacity for future demand over achieving immediate profitability, show a clear focus on the long term.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** No. The company's financial position is weak. It is not cash-flow positive, reporting cash used in operations of $2.0 million in Q1 2025. Its auditor has issued a "going concern" warning, indicating it may not have sufficient funds to sustain operations for the next twelve months without additional capital. The company has a recent history of dilutive financing, including a public offering in May 2024 and an at-the-market program that sold over 1 million shares. Further equity financing is a near certainty.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the Management's Discussion & Analysis section of its Q1 2025 report, management was exceptionally candid about its recent severe business challenges. They plainly stated that revenues fell 78% due to "significantly reduced demand due in large part to increased competitive and market pressure by large competitors." They did not obscure the issue with jargon and were direct about the cause and effect of their poor results, which is the hallmark of candor during a difficult period.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's filings disclose a significant number of related-party transactions. These include leasing its main facility from the Executive Chairman, taking on numerous loans from executives and directors, and subsequently restructuring that debt in a transaction with the same insiders. For example, on April 28, 2025, the company exchanged over $2.7 million in outstanding notes held by top executives for new senior convertible notes. While disclosed and approved by disinterested directors, the sheer volume and critical nature of these transactions create potential conflicts of interest and prevent the company from meeting the high standard of "unquestionable integrity."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025070957/sowg-20250331.htm (filed May 14, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490161/000095017025045749/sowg-20241231.htm (filed March 27, 2025)

**Synthesis**

Sow Good Inc. exhibits some positive Fisher characteristics, notably a commitment to product development, a long-range outlook evidenced by capacity investment, and laudable candor with investors about its recent struggles. However, these are overshadowed by profound negatives. The company is unprofitable, faces an existential threat from larger competitors who have decimated its revenue, and its auditor has raised "substantial doubt" about its ability to continue as a going concern. The management structure lacks depth, relies heavily on its co-founders, and is marked by numerous related-party transactions that raise governance questions. The most critical variable that could change the score in the next 12-24 months is survival itself. To turn any "No" answers to "Yes," the company must first stabilize its revenue by proving it can win back customers and shelf space. Following that, it would need to demonstrate a clear path to net profitability, reduce its reliance on dilutive financing, and strengthen its management team beyond the founders.

**fisher score is 4 / 15**
