### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. PYLARIFY Revenue Growth Impact**

*   **Base Case:** Assume PYLARIFY 2025 revenue of $1.32B (25% growth), with a 4x Price/Sales multiple. This would imply a market cap contribution of $5.28B from PYLARIFY alone.
*   **High-Growth Case:** Assume 35% growth to $1.43B. At a 5x P/S multiple (reflecting higher growth), this would imply a market cap contribution of $7.15B. This represents a potential ~$1.87B increase in valuation from this single product.

**2. PNT2002 Approval Impact**

*   **Base Case:** Assume PNT2002 peak sales of $1.5B, with a 3x peak sales multiple (typical for biopharma). This would imply a potential future valuation of $4.5B. Discounting this back 2 years at 10% gives a present value of ~$3.7B.
*   **High Case:** Assume peak sales of $2B. At a 4x multiple, this would imply a future valuation of $8B. Discounted back, this is a present value of ~$6.6B. The difference between the base and high case represents a potential ~$2.9B in long-term value creation.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The near-term catalysts for Lantheus are predominantly positive. The continued strong growth of PYLARIFY is the most significant driver, and any upside surprises in quarterly sales could move the stock higher. The potential for a favorable resolution to the PNT2003 litigation and a subsequent launch represents a medium-impact catalyst. The pending acquisitions of Life Molecular Imaging and Evergreen Theragnostics, while smaller in immediate impact, should be seen as positive strategic moves that strengthen the company's long-term position. Overall, the net catalyst balance for the next 0-12 months is positive, suggesting a favorable outlook for the stock.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **A significant and unexpected slowdown in PYLARIFY sales growth:** As the primary revenue driver, any material deceleration would heavily impact the company's financial performance and valuation.
2.  **A negative regulatory decision on PNT2002:** If the FDA requires a new, lengthy clinical trial or rejects the drug, it would be a major setback to the company's long-term growth strategy.
3.  **A major safety issue with a key product:** An unexpected safety concern with PYLARIFY or another major product could lead to a product recall or restricted use, severely damaging the company's reputation and financial results.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

Lantheus Holdings presents a compelling investment case driven by the strong near-term growth of its flagship product, PYLARIFY, and a robust pipeline of high-potential, long-term catalysts. The most significant near-term driver is the continued market penetration of PYLARIFY, with a potential upside of over 30% to the stock price if high growth rates are sustained. The single most important indicator to monitor is the quarterly PYLARIFY sales figures, as this will be the primary determinant of the stock's performance in the coming 12 months.
