**Synthesis**

Dave & Buster's scores well on Fisher's 15-point checklist, with strong marks for its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and experienced management team. The company's unique business model and strong brand give it a significant competitive advantage. The only area where the company could improve is in its labor and personnel relations, where there is a lack of specific evidence to support an "outstanding" rating. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the success of their new store formats, the effectiveness of their organic growth initiatives, and their ability to manage costs in a challenging inflationary environment. To turn the "No" on labor relations to a "Yes," the company would need to provide more disclosure on employee turnover, engagement, and satisfaction.

fisher score is 14 / 15
