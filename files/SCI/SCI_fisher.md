Service Corporation International, August 23, 2025, primary sources reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K filed February 13, 2025, and Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript from July 31, 2025.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Service Corporation International (SCI) is the largest provider of deathcare products and services in North America, with an estimated 17% market share. The company's growth is supported by powerful demographic trends, specifically the aging of the Baby Boomer generation, which is expected to increase the number of deaths. This demographic tailwind provides a long-term, predictable increase in the underlying demand for its funeral and cemetery services. SCI's preneed sales backlog, which reached $16.0 billion at year-end 2024, provides significant visibility into future revenue as these contracts mature.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI is actively investing capital to adapt to changing consumer preferences, such as the shift towards cremation and personalized "celebration of life" ceremonies. The company is repurposing facilities into modern event rooms and expanding its range of cremation-specific merchandise and memorialization options like glass-front niches and cremation gardens. In Q2 2025 alone, the company deployed $100 million in capital expenditures for maintenance, cemetery development, and strategic acquisitions to enhance its network. Management has also transitioned to a new preneed insurance provider to streamline processes and bolster future sales growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Traditional R&D is not a material expenditure for SCI. Instead, development is focused on process improvements, new service offerings, and technology implementation. The company has deployed customer-facing technologies like a digital point-of-sale system (HMIS+) and a mobile preneed sales system (Beacon) to improve the customer experience and presentation of options. While no specific financial metrics are provided to quantify the return on these technology investments, management's commentary suggests these efforts have resulted in favorable customer satisfaction ratings and increased digital sales leads.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI maintains a large, highly trained sales force of approximately 3,600 counselors dedicated to preneed sales. The company invests significantly in sales tools and technology, including a customer relationship management (CRM) system that leverages data analytics for lead tracking and follow-up campaigns. Preneed sales production is a key driver of the company's $16.0 billion future revenue backlog. Management expects preneed funeral and cemetery sales to continue growing at low to mid-single digit percentages, indicating a productive sales force.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGuEyVZtMsNcpLTD0imOv7XypUAzLE92LI3kM72tfC0x4kavPKdttfSQaInw-AwgF1E12mb2hU66na9A8QFqYWgjtqJvkvrZsVBClvXdTlYe2uiOUXoIqaQ9-QpGuWzttNeASDRIBjs4OOzRgR73Vj4JcNV85DJbHW2hDcBEp7FG9nKmIwHCJ9-oeXY5G5WlLN6n2ZZJZvo7VS-LOZYVFlbEG-aoB2ujO1ZJQZq3zkusYVE", July 31, 2025], ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI demonstrates strong profitability. For the full year 2024, the company reported a consolidated gross profit of $1.09 billion on $4.19 billion in revenue, for a gross margin of approximately 26%. In Q2 2025, the funeral segment's gross profit percentage increased by 210 basis points to about 20%, reflecting effective cost management. The cemetery segment's gross profit percentage for 2024 was approximately 33.5%. These margins are substantial for a business with high fixed costs.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025], ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE478dC1PkN047WRPDuMlYTdUA1lAS4HiHhBNwqLRD4OCDA1g1QG6pclxUQyXDQcBw6TKAgusyvYkM82m42xACMw1w90HK5mmpyp3lHxLoRNcYimuDp0pCXk2nL3Pu5hQlL3a2zDqXi6f98Wf7chVTI6HhOJ74-uW70qN2r4zs6X_9vFrSC74VMMfJM-xCX9H8MLZr5ePOmTtSbP7wRVZQt2qDZhXmKS0SVuNR3ZLgWTO5G", July 31, 2025]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on leveraging the company's scale to improve margins. This includes standardizing processes, optimizing its network of combination funeral home/cemetery locations to share costs, and using its purchasing power in the supply chain. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, the CEO highlighted that a solid 3% revenue increase combined with managing fixed costs below inflationary trends led to a $15 million increase in funeral gross profit. This demonstrates a clear strategy of controlling fixed costs to drive margin expansion as revenue grows.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025], ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQE478dC1PkN047WRPDuMlYTdUA1lAS4HiHhBNwqLRD4OCDA1g1QG6pclxUQyXDQcBw6TKAgusyvYkM82m42xACMw1w90HK5mmpyp3lHxLoRNcYimuDp0pCXk2nL3Pu5hQlL3a2zDqXi6f98Wf7chVTI6HhOJ74-uW70qN2r4zs6X_9vFrSC74VMMfJM-xCX9H8MLZr5ePOmTtSbP7wRVZQt2qDZhXmKS0SVuNR3ZLgWTO5G", July 31, 2025]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI states that relations with its approximately 25,000 employees are "generally considered favorable," with only about 2.4% of associates represented by unions. The company has been certified as a "Great Place To Work" since 2017 in the U.S. and since 2020 in Canada, based on voluntary employee surveys. SCI offers benefits including group health plans, a 401(k) with a company match, tuition reimbursement, and employee assistance programs. The absence of disclosed major labor disputes in recent filings supports this positive assessment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team demonstrates significant stability and long tenure. The Chairman and CEO, Thomas L. Ryan, has been with the company since 1996 and has served as CEO since 2005. Other top executives, such as the President and CFO, also have tenures with the company dating back to the 1990s. This long service history among senior leadership suggests a stable and cohesive executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI's public filings disclose a deep bench of seven named executive officers with clear roles and responsibilities beyond the CEO, including a President, CFO, COO, General Counsel, and heads of Operations Services and Accounting. The biographies provided in the 2024 10-K show that many of these executives were promoted from within after serving in various management roles across the organization, indicating a strong pipeline of internal talent and succession planning. For instance, the current President, Sumner J. Waring, III, joined in 1996 and held numerous operational leadership roles before his promotion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI's 2024 10-K includes a report from its independent registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, which provides an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. The company provides detailed segment reporting for its funeral and cemetery operations, offering granular data on revenues and gross profits. The filing indicates no history of material restatements or significant auditor disagreements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI's primary competitive advantage is its unparalleled scale and network density in a fragmented industry. With 1,493 funeral homes and 496 cemeteries, many of which are combination locations, SCI can share resources and generate cost efficiencies that smaller, independent operators cannot match. The high barriers to entry in the cemetery business, due to land requirements and zoning regulations, make its portfolio of ~35,800 acres of cemetery land a significant, difficult-to-replicate asset. The company's well-known Dignity Memorial® brand also provides a national identity and a promise of consistent service quality, differentiating it from local competitors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's business model, centered on a massive $16.0 billion preneed backlog, is inherently long-term. Management's capital allocation strategy prioritizes long-term value creation through strategic acquisitions and the construction of new facilities, which require significant upfront investment for future returns. In 2024, SCI invested $181.2 million in acquisitions and $62.1 million in real estate for future locations. While the company provides annual guidance, its narrative consistently emphasizes leveraging long-term demographic trends and securing future market share via preneed sales, demonstrating a focus that extends well beyond short-term results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** SCI's financial position is strong, characterized by consistent operating cash flow ($944.9 million in 2024). The company funds its growth through this cash flow and access to debt markets. Far from issuing equity, SCI has a long history of actively repurchasing shares to return capital to shareholders. In 2024, the company repurchased 3.4 million shares for $249.8 million. This consistent buyback activity demonstrates that the company can fund its operations, investments, and acquisitions without diluting shareholders.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates transparency in its investor communications. In the Q2 2025 earnings call summary, the company openly discussed challenges, such as the temporary reduction in sales production due to the transition to a new preneed insurance provider and increases in G&A expenses from higher liability insurance costs. Discussing these specific headwinds, alongside positive results, shows a willingness to present a balanced view of the business rather than focusing only on successes.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGuEyVZtMsNcpLTD0imOv7XypUAzLE92LI3kM72tfC0x4kavPKdttfSQaInw-AwgF1E12mb2hU66na9A8QFqYWgjtqJvkvrZsVBClvXdTlYe2uiOUXoIqaQ9-QpGuWzttNeASDRIBjs4OOzRgR73Vj4JcNV85DJbHW2hDcBEp7FG9nKmIwHCJ9-oeXY5G5WlLN6n2ZZJZvo7VS-LOZYVFlbEG-aoB2ujO1ZJQZq3zkusYVE", July 31, 2025]

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The 2024 10-K discloses various legal proceedings and regulatory matters, which are normal for a company of SCI's size and scope. One notable item is a reduction in a legal reserve related to previously disclosed matters in California that have now been resolved. While the company faces litigation inherent to its business, there are no disclosures of major, enterprise-threatening scandals, SEC investigations into executive conduct, or widespread fraud. The company's independent auditor provided a clean opinion on its financial statements and internal controls for 2024, providing further assurance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ["https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/89089/000008908925000011/sci-20241231.htm", February 13, 2025]

**Synthesis**
Service Corporation International scores exceptionally well against Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a mature, well-managed business with powerful and predictable long-term tailwinds. The company's strongest positives are its dominant market position, the demographic certainty of its end market, and a disciplined capital allocation strategy that balances internal investment with significant shareholder returns. The $16 billion preneed backlog provides a unique and durable competitive advantage, ensuring revenue visibility for years to come. The most critical variable that could change this score in the next 12-24 months would be a significant shift in consumer preference away from traditional memorialization services at a pace faster than SCI can adapt its offerings and pricing model, which could pressure margins. Evidence that would flip a "No" to a "Yes" is not applicable, as all points were answered in the affirmative. The key risk to monitor is the company's ability to maintain its pricing power and margin structure as the cremation rate continues to climb.

fisher score is 15 / 15
