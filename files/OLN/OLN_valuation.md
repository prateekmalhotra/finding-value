Of course. Here is a critique of the original valuation and a revised version with more realistic assumptions, following the requested format.

***

### **Critique of Original Valuation & Summary of Revisions**

The provided valuation is well-structured but contains several assumptions and methodological choices that could be refined to better reflect the cyclical nature of Olin Corporation and standard valuation practices.

1.  **Static, Low-Growth Assumptions:** The model uses a flat 2.0% revenue growth and a static 8.0% operating margin. For a cyclical company like Olin, whose financials show it is likely near a trough, a more realistic model would project a recovery phase with improving growth and margins before they normalize.
2.  **Incorrect Free Cash Flow (FCFF) Formula:** The original formula double-counts Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) as a cash expense by subtracting it from post-tax profit. SBC is a non-cash charge already accounted for in EBIT. Its primary impact is shareholder dilution, which is correctly handled in the share count projection. The standard FCFF formula will be used in the revision.
3.  **Potentially Inappropriate Terminal Value Method:** The Gordon Growth Model (GGM) assumes the company is in a stable, mature state in the terminal year. The original model's static 8.0% margin may not represent a normalized "steady state," making the GGM less reliable. An Exit Multiple (EV/EBITDA) is often more appropriate for cyclical industries, as it values the company based on a mid-cycle multiple of its earnings power.
4.  **Slightly Outdated Cost of Debt:** The Cost of Debt was based on trailing interest expense. A revised calculation will use a rate more reflective of current market borrowing costs for a company with Olin's credit profile.

The following revised valuation addresses these points by modeling a cyclical recovery, correcting the FCFF calculation, and using a more appropriate terminal value methodology.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation**

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** $23.17 (as of August 22, 2025, 4:00 PM EDT).

2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM as of June 30, 2025):**

| Metric | Value (in millions USD) | Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Revenue | $6,663 | (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 24, 2025) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the current market price of $23.17 per share, which corresponds to an enterprise value of approximately $5,700 million, the market must have certain expectations for Olin's future performance. By holding the operating margin constant at the trailing twelve months (TTM) level of 2.93% and using a calculated Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) of 7.07%, a reverse DCF model indicates the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue growth CAGR of approximately 7.5%**. This growth rate is required to generate sufficient future free cash flows to support the current valuation.

***

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Analyst's Review:** The market-implied growth rate of 7.5% seems high, but the original analyst's 2.0% is likely too low given the company is at a cyclical trough. My assumptions model a gradual recovery in both revenue and profitability.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1â€“5:** I project a cyclical recovery, with **4.0% growth in Year 1, tapering to a long-term rate of 2.5% by Year 3**. This reflects a bounce-back from depressed levels followed by more moderate, mature growth.

8.  **Margin Path:** Olin's TTM operating margin is a cyclical low of 2.93%, while its 3-year average is 12.1%. I will model a **gradual margin recovery** from 5.0% in Year 1 to a normalized, mid-cycle margin of **10.0% by Year 5**, well below its recent peak.

9.  **Taxes:** The 3-year average effective tax rate of 21.9% is reasonable. I will use a normalized **effective tax rate of 22.0%**.

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **D&A:** TTM D&A is 7.8% of revenue. I will model D&A at a more normalized **7.5% of revenue**.
    *   **Capex:** The 3-year average is ~3.3% of revenue. I will assume **capex remains at 3.5% of revenue** to support operations and growth.
    *   **Working Capital:** Change in working capital is modeled as **1.0% of the change in revenue**, a standard and realistic assumption.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) will be modeled as **0.3% of revenue**, consistent with TTM levels. It is a non-cash expense and will not be subtracted in the FCFF calculation.
    *   Olin's aggressive buyback history is noted. I will maintain the projection of a **net 2.0% annual reduction in shares outstanding**, balancing repurchases against dilution from SBC.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

12. Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated using the standard formula:
    `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

    **FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**
| Year | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | 2029 | 2030 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $6,930 | $7,137 | $7,316 | $7,500 | $7,687 |
| **Op. Margin** | 5.0% | 7.0% | 8.5% | 9.5% | 10.0% |
| EBIT | $346 | $499 | $622 | $712 | $769 |
| NOPAT | $270 | $390 | $485 | $556 | $600 |
| D&A | $520 | $535 | $549 | $562 | $577 |
| Capex | -$243 | -$250 | -$256 | -$262 | -$269 |
| Chg. in WC | -$3 | -$2 | -$2 | -$2 | -$2 |
| **FCFF** | **$544** | **$673** | **$776** | **$854** | **$906** |

13. FCFF is used because it represents the cash available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure, making it ideal for enterprise valuation.

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield as of August 22, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (standard assumption for the U.S. market).
    *   **Beta:** 1.53 (reflects Olin's cyclicality and higher-than-average market volatility).
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.53 * 5.0% = 11.91%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   To reflect current market rates for a company with Olin's credit profile, a pre-tax **Cost of Debt of 6.25%** is used.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 6.25% * (1 - 22.0%) = 4.88%.

16. **WACC:**
    *   Market Value of Equity (E) = $2,660M
    *   Market Value of Debt (D) = $3,284M
    *   Total Value (V) = E + D = $5,944M
    *   **WACC = (2660/5944) * 11.91% + (3284/5944) * 4.88% = 5.33% + 2.70% = 8.03%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Exit Multiple Method:**
    *   Given the cyclical industry, a terminal value based on an EV/EBITDA multiple is more appropriate than a perpetuity growth model. A conservative, mid-cycle multiple of **7.0x** is used.
    *   Projected Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT + Year 5 D&A = $769M + $577M = $1,346 million.
    *   **Terminal Value = 7.0 * $1,346M = $9,422 million.**

18. **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   The exit multiple of 7.0x implies a perpetual growth rate (g).
    *   g = (WACC - (FCFF_Terminal / Terminal Value)) = 8.03% - ($906M / $9,422M) = -1.59%. This is not a sensible result and highlights the disconnect when applying a GGM to a business not yet in a normalized cash flow state relative to its EBITDA. The Exit Multiple method remains the more logical choice, reflecting a sale at a reasonable mid-cycle valuation.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = $544/(1.0803)^1 + ... + $906/(1.0803)^5 = $3,046 million.
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $9,422M / (1.0803)^5 = $6,412 million.
    *   **Enterprise Value = $3,046M + $6,412M = $9,458 million.**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = $3,284M - $223.8M = $3,060.2 million.
    *   **Equity Value = $9,458M - $3,060.2M = $6,397.8 million.**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Year 5 Shares Outstanding = 116.0M * (1 - 0.02)^5 = 104.9 million shares.
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $6,397.8M / 104.9M shares = $60.99 per share.**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $60.99** (Cyclical recovery to 10% margin, 7.0x exit multiple).
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $46.00** (Slower recovery to 8.5% margin, 6.5x exit multiple).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $78.00** (Stronger recovery to 11.5% margin, 7.5x exit multiple).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% discount to the base-case fair value accounts for execution risk and forecasting uncertainty.
    *   **MOS Price = $60.99 * (1 - 0.30) = $42.69.**

***

**Risk Notes**

The primary risks to this valuation include the cyclicality of the chemical and ammunition industries, which can lead to revenue and margin volatility. Second, the company is exposed to fluctuations in raw material and energy costs, which could compress profitability. Finally, significant environmental and regulatory risks are inherent in chemical manufacturing operations.
