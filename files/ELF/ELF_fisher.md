**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently prioritizes investments in marketing and brand-building over short-term profit maximization. In the Q1 FY26 earnings call, the company raised its full-year sales outlook significantly but maintained its adjusted EBITDA guidance, signaling a deliberate choice to reinvest incremental profits back into growth initiatives.

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, the company had $138.8 million in cash and cash equivalents and generated positive cash from operations. The company has a revolving credit facility for additional liquidity if needed. Given its strong cash flow generation and existing capital structure, e.l.f. is well-positioned to fund its growth initiatives through operating cash flow and existing debt capacity without needing to issue dilutive equity.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management maintains a high level of transparency and engagement with investors through detailed earnings call presentations and participation in industry conferences. In their calls, they provide specific drivers for growth, market share data, and a clear articulation of their strategy and capital allocation priorities. While the company is in a period of strong performance, the level of detail provided suggests a commitment to open communication.

Synthesis:
e.l.f. Beauty scores exceptionally well against Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a business with a clear growth strategy, strong execution, and a disciplined management team. The strongest positives are its long runway for growth through market share gains and international expansion, its effective and rapid innovation cycle, and its long-range focus on reinvesting for durable growth. There are no significant negatives or "No" answers based on current evidence. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to sustain its high growth rate as it scales, maintain margin discipline amidst heavy investment, and successfully expand its international footprint, particularly in Western Europe. Evidence of slowing market share gains or a significant deceleration in sales growth would be the primary catalysts to change the current high score.

fisher score is 15 / 15
