Ingles Markets, Incorporated does not provide public forward-looking guidance and has not held earnings calls since 2018.

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1:** A 2.0% decline is projected, reflecting the impact of Hurricane Helene and a slow recovery, followed by a gradual return to growth.
    *   **Years 2-5:** A 2.5% annual growth rate, based on the 3-year historical CAGR, reflecting store modernization and expansion.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin (EBIT):** A 3.5% operating margin is assumed throughout the forecast period, in line with the 3-year historical average, excluding the impact of one-time events.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   **Effective Tax Rate:** 24.3%, based on the average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years. (10-K, Dec 27, 2024)
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** $140 million in Year 1, the midpoint of the company's fiscal 2025 plans ($120-$160 million), then 2.5% of revenue for subsequent years. (10-Q, Feb 6, 2025)
    *   **Working Capital:** 1.0% of incremental revenue, based on historical averages.
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Stock-Based Compensation:** Not material enough to be reported, so it is assumed to be $0.
    *   **Diluted Share Count:** 19.0 million shares are used for the final per-share value calculation. (10-Q, Feb 6, 2025)

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

**FCFF = EBIT \* (1 - tax rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital**

| (USD in millions) | Y1 | Y2 | Y3 | Y4 | Y5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **FCFF** | **$77.9** | **$124.9** | **$128.8** | **$132.8** | **$136.9** |

*FCFF is used for valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of capital structure.*

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury yield as of August 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0%
    *   **Beta:** 0.5 (Reflects the company's low volatility and stable, non-cyclical business)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 0.5 \* 5.0% = 6.75%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Cost of Debt:** 4.0% (Inferred from interest expense / average debt)
*   **WACC:**
    *   **WACC = (E/V)\*Re + (D/V)\*Rd\*(1-t) = 7.9%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Reflecting long-run inflation expectations)
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF \* (1+g)) / (WACC - g) = ($136.9 \* 1.025) / (7.9% - 2.5%) = $2,601.5 million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $325.3 million
    *   **Exit Multiple:** 8.0x (In line with the company's historical median multiple)
    *   **Terminal Value = 8.0 \* $325.3 = $2,602.4 million**
    *   The Gordon Growth and Exit Multiple methods yield very similar terminal values, providing confidence in the estimate.

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:** **$105.59** ($2,006.2 million / 19.0 million shares)
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** $85 (Lower growth of 1.5% and margin compression to 3.0%)

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%):** **$73.91**

### **Risk Notes**

*   **Increased Competition:** The grocery industry is highly competitive, with pressure from larger national chains and alternative formats, which could impact pricing and market share.
*   **Economic Sensitivity:** Consumer spending is sensitive to economic conditions, and a downturn could lead to reduced sales and a shift to lower-margin products.
*   **Geographic Concentration:** Ingles' concentration in the southeastern U.S. exposes it to regional economic downturns and risks such as the recent Hurricane Helene.
*   **Lack of Transparency:** The absence of management guidance and earnings calls makes it more challenging for investors to assess the company's outlook and strategy.
