**Re-calculation:**
*   Network Effects: 1 * 0.18 = 0.18
*   Switching Costs: 1 * 0.15 = 0.15
*   Cost Advantage: 3 * 0.15 = 0.45
*   Intangible Assets: 5 * 0.12 = 0.60
*   Distribution & Scale: 5 * 0.10 = 0.50
*   Data Advantage: 3 * 0.10 = 0.30
*   Ecosystem: 2 * 0.08 = 0.16
*   Regulatory Barriers: 2 * 0.06 = 0.12
*   Capital Intensity: 3 * 0.04 = 0.12
*   Revenue Visibility: 2 * 0.02 = 0.04
*   **Weighted Score = (1\*18) + (1\*15) + (3\*15) + (5\*12) + (5\*10) + (3\*10) + (2\*8) + (2\*6) + (3\*4) + (2\*2) = 18 + 15 + 45 + 60 + 50 + 30 + 16 + 12 + 12 + 4 = 262**. My math is wrong. Let's do it again.
*   (1\*0.18) + (1\*0.15) + (3\*0.15) + (5\*0.12) + (5\*0.10) + (3\*0.10) + (2\*0.08) + (2\*0.06) + (3\*0.04) + (2\*0.02) = 0.18 + 0.15 + 0.45 + 0.60 + 0.50 + 0.30 + 0.16 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.04 = 2.62. The final score is out of 5. So the weighted score is 2.62.
*   No, the final weighted score is on a 0-100 scale, so I multiply by 20. (2.62 * 20) = 52.4. Let me re-read the scoring.
*   "Compute a weighted score = sum(score_dim * weight_dim)". The weights are percentages. So (1 \* 18) + (1 \* 15) etc. is correct. Let me redo the sum.
*   1\*18 + 1\*15 + 3\*15 + 5\*12 + 5\*10 + 3\*10 + 2\*8 + 2\*6 + 3\*4 + 2\*2 = 18 + 15 + 45 + 60 + 50 + 30 + 16 + 12 + 12 + 4 = **262**. This can't be right.
*   Let's check the weights: 18+15+15+12+10+10+8+6+4+2 = 100. The weights are correct.
*   Let's check the scores: The scores are 0-5.
*   Ah, I see. I'm summing the raw score multiplied by the percentage value, not the decimal.
*   Weighted Contribution: 1\*18=18, 1\*15=15, 3\*15=45, 5\*12=60, 5\*10=50, 3\*10=30, 2\*8=16, 2\*6=12, 3\*4=12, 2\*2=4. Sum = 262. This isn't a score out of 100.
*   Okay, let's try a different calculation. The weighted score is the sum of (score * weight). Let's use the score out of 100 (score * 20). So (20\*18) + (20\*15)... No, that's not right.
*   Let's go back to the definition. **Weighted Score = sum(score_dim * weight_dim)**. The score is 0-5. The weight is a percentage.
*   Let's try (1/5 \* 18) + (1/5 \* 15) ... No.
*   Let's assume the score should be multiplied by the weight percentage.
*   (1 \* 18) + (1 \* 15) + (3 \* 15) + (5 \* 12) + (5 \* 10) + (3 \* 10) + (2 \* 8) + (2 \* 6) + (3 \* 4) + (2 \* 2) = 262. This seems wrong.
*   Let's try a weighted average: `(1*18 + 1*15 + 3*15 + 5*12 + 5*10 + 3*10 + 2*8 + 2*6 + 3*4 + 2*2) / 100` = 2.62. This is the weighted average score out of 5.
*   To get a score out of 100, I should multiply this by 20. 2.62 * 20 = 52.4. Let's use this.

| Dimension | Weight % | Raw Score (0–5) | Weighted Contribution |

### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** NIKE lacks traditional network effects common in digital platforms. However, its brand creates a powerful social network effect; the brand's value and desirability increase as more consumers and high-profile athletes adopt its products. This effect is weaker than a true platform network and is more a function of brand strength.
**Evidence:**
*   The company aims to build "deep personal consumer connections" through its digital platforms and apps, which foster a community but do not create a direct network utility from user growth. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for consumers are exceptionally low, as is typical for the apparel and footwear industry. While NIKE's fitness apps (Nike Run Club, Nike Training Club) store user data and preferences, creating a minor behavioral lock-in, this is not a significant barrier to a customer choosing a competitor for their next purchase. There is no contractual or technical lock-in for consumers.
**Evidence:**
*   NIKE offers "interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps," which can create minor stickiness for engaged users. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** As the world's largest seller of athletic footwear and apparel, NIKE's immense scale in manufacturing, logistics, and marketing provides significant cost advantages. However, its gross margin is not consistently superior to its closest peer, Adidas. For its fiscal year 2024, Nike's gross margin was 44.6%, while Adidas reported a gross margin of 47.5% for its fiscal year 2023, suggesting that scale has not translated into clear unit cost leadership.
**Evidence:**
*   NIKE's gross margin was 44.6% in fiscal 2024, up from 43.5% in fiscal 2023, driven by strategic pricing and lower freight costs, but partially offset by higher product input costs. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   For fiscal year 2024, factories in Vietnam, Indonesia, and China manufactured approximately 50%, 27%, and 18% of total NIKE Brand footwear, respectively, indicating significant manufacturing scale in low-cost regions. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   Adidas reported a gross margin of 47.5% in fiscal year 2023. (adidas Annual Report 2023, March 13, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** This is the primary source of NIKE's economic moat. The NIKE and Swoosh trademarks are globally iconic and synonymous with athletic performance and culture, enabling premium pricing and commanding intense consumer loyalty. This is supported by a massive marketing budget, extensive patent portfolio, and long-standing relationships with the world's most influential athletes.
**Evidence:**
*   The company considers its NIKE and Swoosh Design trademarks to be "among our most valuable assets" and has registered them in over 190 jurisdictions. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   Demand creation expense (marketing and promotion) was USD 4,285 million in fiscal 2024, a massive investment that reinforces the brand's power and visibility. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   The company holds numerous U.S. and foreign patents for technologies like Nike Air, Flyknit, and Dri-FIT, which provide product differentiation. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 5 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** NIKE has a formidable, multi-channel global distribution network that is extremely difficult to replicate. Its "NIKE Direct" strategy, combining a huge footprint of owned retail stores with a sophisticated digital commerce platform, gives it direct consumer access and brand control. This is complemented by a vast network of wholesale partners, creating a dense and efficient path to market worldwide.
**Evidence:**
*   NIKE Direct operations accounted for approximately 44% of total NIKE Brand revenues in fiscal 2024, totaling USD 21.5 billion. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   As of May 31, 2024, the company operated 1,045 retail stores worldwide (377 in the U.S. and 668 non-U.S.). (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   The company utilizes 8 significant distribution centers in the U.S. and 68 distribution centers outside of the U.S., showcasing a logistics network built for massive scale. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 5 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** Through its NIKE Direct business, including its e-commerce platforms and suite of fitness apps, NIKE collects vast amounts of consumer data. This data on preferences, purchase history, and athletic activity provides a significant advantage in product development, demand forecasting, and personalized marketing. While the exact size of the dataset is not disclosed, the scale of its digital operations implies a hard-to-replicate asset.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's strategy focuses on creating "deep personal consumer connections" and delivering "compelling consumer experiences through digital platforms," which are powered by consumer data. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   NIKE Brand Digital sales were USD 12.1 billion for fiscal 2024, indicating a massive volume of digital transactions from which to gather data. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** NIKE has built a strong ecosystem connecting its footwear and apparel with digital services like the Nike Run Club and Nike Training Club apps. These services enhance the value of the core products and drive engagement and loyalty, funneling users back to its retail channels. While it is not a true third-party platform, this integrated hardware-software ecosystem strengthens the customer relationship.
**Evidence:**
*   The company offers "interactive consumer services and experiences as well as digital products through our digital platforms, including fitness and activity apps; sport, fitness and wellness content," which complement its physical products. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The primary regulatory barriers are related to international trade, tariffs, and intellectual property. NIKE's vast patent and trademark portfolio offers protection but does not prevent competition. The company is exposed to shifts in trade policy, which can impact costs, but these are industry-wide risks rather than a unique moat source for NIKE.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's success is supported by its intellectual property rights, including trademarks, utility and design patents, copyrights, and trade secrets. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   NIKE's operations are subject to risks from "foreign and domestic trade policies, increases in import duties, anti-dumping measures, quotas, safeguard measures, [and] trade restrictions." (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** While NIKE outsources nearly all manufacturing, its capital requirements for building its brand, R&D facilities, and global distribution and retail network are immense. Replicating its global footprint of flagship stores, logistics centers, and the technology infrastructure for its direct-to-consumer business would require billions in sunk costs and years of execution, deterring new entrants.
**Evidence:**
*   Capital expenditures for property, plant, and equipment were USD 812 million in fiscal 2024. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
*   The company outsources nearly all product manufacturing but makes significant investments in its owned NIKE Direct operations and logistics footprint. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 3 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** As a predominantly consumer-facing company, NIKE lacks long-term customer contracts. However, its wholesale business provides some forward visibility through its futures ordering program, where retailers place orders several months in advance. This is a minor advantage and is subject to cancellations and changes.
**Evidence:**
*   The company offers a futures ordering program, allowing customers to "place orders five to six months ahead of delivery," which assists in scheduling production. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (1 * 18) + (1 * 15) + (3 * 15) + (5 * 12) + (5 * 10) + (3 * 10) + (2 * 8) + (2 * 6) + (3 * 4) + (2 * 2) = 18 + 15 + 45 + 60 + 50 + 30 + 16 + 12 + 12 + 4 = 262. (Dividing by 5, as scores are out of 5, gives 52.4).
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 52.4 / 100

### **Mapping**
*   A weighted score of 52.4 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range.
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 3.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The durability of NIKE's moat is estimated at 10–15 years, primarily anchored by its world-renowned brand, a form of intangible asset that is difficult and expensive to replicate and erodes very slowly. The company's massive and efficient global distribution scale, combined with its direct-to-consumer channel, provides a secondary long-term advantage. While patents expire, the company's continuous innovation pipeline and staggering marketing spend ensure the brand remains culturally relevant and at the forefront of consumer preference. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Brand Relevance Fades:** A significant shift in consumer preferences towards competitor brands or a major marketing misstep could tarnish NIKE's brand image, eroding its primary moat source. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
2.  **Disruption in Distribution:** A sustained disruption to its key distribution channels or a failure to adapt to the next wave of digital commerce could weaken its efficient scale advantage. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).
3.  **Loss of Innovation Edge:** Competitors achieving a breakthrough in product technology that NIKE cannot match could diminish its reputation for innovation and performance, allowing peers to command a similar price premium. (NIKE, Inc. 2024 10-K, July 25, 2024).

### **KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Gross Margin vs. Peers:** A consistent decline relative to Adidas and other competitors would indicate an erosion of pricing power or cost advantage.
*   **NIKE Direct as % of Revenue:** A stall or decline in this metric could signal a weakening of its direct consumer relationships and data advantage.
*   **Demand Creation Expense as % of Revenue:** A significant increase without a corresponding rise in revenue growth may suggest the brand's power is weakening, requiring more spending to maintain share.
*   **Revenue Growth in Greater China:** This is a key growth market; sustained underperformance could indicate a failure to resonate with a critical consumer base.
*   **Digital App Engagement (MAU/DAU):** A decline in active users for Nike's fitness apps could be a leading indicator of waning ecosystem engagement.
*   **Inventory Levels:** A sustained, significant increase in inventory days could signal a mismatch between production and consumer demand.

### **Short Verdict**
The final rating is appropriate because NIKE's primary moat source, its intangible brand equity, is exceptionally strong and durable, justifying a high score in that heavily weighted category. Its vast distribution network provides a secondary, powerful advantage. However, the company lacks strong network effects and switching costs, and its cost advantage is not clearly superior to its main competitor, preventing a higher rating. A significant and sustained loss of brand relevance or a failure to innovate ahead of peers would be the key evidence that could lead to a rating downgrade.

moat rating is 3 / 5
