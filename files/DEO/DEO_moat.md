***

### **1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Network effects are not a meaningful driver of Diageo's business. The value of a Diageo product to a consumer does not increase with the number of other users. While brand popularity can create social proof, this is more accurately captured as an intangible asset rather than a direct network effect.
**Evidence:**
*   The business model is based on producing and selling branded consumer goods, not creating a user-network-based platform. Financial reports and strategic presentations focus on brands and distribution, not user interconnectivity. (Diageo plc 2025 20-F Filing, Aug 14, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs for end consumers are effectively zero, as they can freely choose other brands on any given occasion. For distributors and retailers, switching costs are very low, relating primarily to minor adjustments in ordering and marketing. The primary lock-in is brand loyalty, which is an intangible asset.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's strategy focuses on building brand loyalty and winning market share, acknowledging that consumers have a wide choice. (Diageo Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Feb 4, 2025).
*   Diageo focuses on holding or gaining market share in "measured markets," which implies a competitive environment with active consumer switching. (Diageo Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Feb 4, 2025).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### **3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Diageo's vast global scale in sourcing, production, and marketing provides a significant cost advantage over smaller competitors. This scale allows for procurement efficiencies, lower per-unit manufacturing costs, and more efficient advertising spend. The company is actively targeting further cost savings through structured productivity programs.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo aims to deliver $2 billion in productivity savings from fiscal 2025 through fiscal 2027, with the majority of savings coming from cost of goods sold. (CAGNY Presentation 2024, Mar 1, 2024).
*   The company is executing an "Accelerate programme" with a target of delivering approximately $625 million in cost savings over three years. (Diageo plc 2025 20-F Filing, Aug 14, 2025).
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** This is the core of Diageo's moat. The company owns a portfolio of iconic, world-renowned brands, including "global giants" like Johnnie Walker and Smirnoff, built over decades of investment. This brand equity allows Diageo to command premium pricing, engender consumer loyalty, and secure valuable shelf space globally.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo's portfolio includes over 200 brands sold in more than 180 countries, featuring globally recognized names like Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Tanqueray, Smirnoff, and Don Julio. (CAGNY Presentation 2024, Mar 1, 2024).
*   From fiscal 2017 to 2024, the company increased marketing investment by over $1 billion, which helped drive its share of the Total Beverage Alcohol (TBA) market from 4% in 2020 to 4.7% in 2022. (CAGNY Presentation 2024, Mar 1, 2024).
*   Premium-plus products accounted for 63% of Diageo's net sales in fiscal 2023, demonstrating strong pricing power and the success of its premiumization strategy. (Full Year Results 2023 Presentation, Aug 1, 2023).
**Score:** 5 / 5

### **5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** Diageo possesses a formidable global distribution network that is extremely difficult and costly for competitors to replicate. This "route to consumer" is a critical asset, providing access to shelf space in over 180 countries and creating a significant barrier to entry for new and smaller brands. The scale of this network makes it unprofitable for most potential entrants to even attempt to match.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo's products are sold in more than 180 countries, indicating a vast and complex distribution footprint. (CAGNY Presentation 2024, Mar 1, 2024).
*   The company is investing in "next-generation route-to-market" capabilities, using data and analytics to optimize its powerful existing distribution channels. (Preliminary Results 2024 Presentation, Jul 30, 2024).
**Score:** 5 / 5

### **6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** While Diageo collects vast amounts of consumer and sales data, it is not clear that this data provides a durable, locked-in competitive advantage in the same way it does for technology companies. The data is primarily used to optimize marketing and execution rather than creating a self-improving product feedback loop. Competitors have access to similar channel and market data.
**Evidence:**
*   Diageo is strengthening its capabilities in "tools and analytic strength" to drive advantaged routes to consumer, indicating a focus on using data for executional excellence. (Diageo North America Investor Presentation, Dec 10, 2019).
*   The company is investing in making "intelligent data decisions on where to invest smartly," framing data as a tool for efficiency and ROI rather than a proprietary product advantage. (Diageo North America Investor Presentation, Dec 10, 2019).
**Score:** 2 / 5

### **7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** This dimension is not applicable to Diageo's business model. The company does not operate a platform that connects third-party developers or complementary businesses in a way that creates value-enhancing ecosystem effects. Its business is a vertically-integrated model of brand ownership, production, and distribution.
**Evidence:**
*   Company reports and presentations describe a traditional consumer goods value chain, with no mention of third-party platforms, APIs, or developer ecosystems. (Diageo plc 2025 20-F Filing, Aug 14, 2025).
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The global beverage alcohol industry is highly regulated, creating significant barriers to entry that protect established players like Diageo. These barriers include complex licensing requirements for production and distribution, marketing restrictions, and varying excise tax regimes by jurisdiction. Navigating this complex global regulatory landscape requires substantial expertise and resources, deterring new entrants.
**Evidence:**
*   The business is subject to a wide range of laws and regulations related to production, marketing, sales, and environmental impact across more than 180 countries, creating a complex compliance environment for any market participant. (Diageo plc Annual Report 2024).
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** The production of many of Diageo's core products, particularly Scotch whisky, is highly capital intensive and requires long lead times. The need to build and maintain distilleries, as well as finance maturing inventory for years or even decades, represents a massive sunk cost and a significant deterrent to new competition in aged spirits categories.
**Evidence:**
*   The production of Scotch whisky requires it to be aged in oak casks for a minimum of three years, creating a significant working capital requirement and a long lead time to bring new products to market. This is a structural feature of a key, high-value category for Diageo.
*   In fiscal 2023, Diageo increased capital expenditure invested in maturing stock, highlighting the ongoing capital required to support its aged spirits portfolio. (Full Year Results 2023 Presentation, Aug 1, 2023).
**Score:** 4 / 5

### **10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** Diageo's revenue is transactional and lacks the visibility of long-term contracts. Sales are based on frequent repeat purchases from a vast base of consumers and orders from distributors, which are not contractually recurring over a multi-year horizon.
**Evidence:**
*   Revenue is recognized when control of goods is transferred to the customer, which is indicative of a transactional sales model, not a recurring contractual one. (Diageo plc Annual Report 2024).
**Score:** 0 / 5

### **Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:** (1\*18 + 1\*15 + 4\*15 + 5\*12 + 5\*10 + 2\*10 + 0\*8 + 4\*6 + 4\*4 + 0\*2) / 100 = 2.63 (out of 5)
*   **Final Numeric Score:** 2.63 \* 20 = **52.6 / 100**

### **Mapping**
*   The weighted score of 52.6 falls within the range of 50 ≤ Weighted < 70.
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 3.

### **Moat Duration Justification**
The estimated moat duration is 15+ years. This longevity is primarily supported by the enduring nature of Diageo's intangible assets (brands) and its entrenched global distribution network. Brands like Johnnie Walker and Guinness have existed for over a century, and consumer preferences in this sector change very slowly. Replicating the company's global production footprint, aged liquid inventory, and route-to-market would take a new entrant decades and tens of billions of dollars, making a direct challenge highly unlikely.

### **Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Accelerated Shift in Consumer Tastes:** A rapid and sustained consumer movement away from established global spirits brands towards hyper-local, craft alternatives or different beverage categories (e.g., non-alcoholic) could erode brand relevance and pricing power.
2.  **Major Regulatory Shift:** The implementation of severely restrictive regulations on alcohol marketing, distribution, or taxation in key markets like the United States or India could impair Diageo's ability to build brands and access consumers effectively.
3.  **Sustained Execution Missteps:** A failure to innovate, anticipate consumer trends, and manage the complex global supply chain effectively could lead to persistent market share loss to more agile competitors, as seen in challenging periods like fiscal 2024. (Preliminary Results 2024 Presentation, Jul 30, 2024).

### **KPIs to Monitor**
1.  **Organic Net Sales Growth:** Sustained growth below the industry average would indicate brand erosion.
2.  **Price/Mix Contribution to Growth:** A declining contribution signals weakening pricing power, a core tenet of the brand moat. (Preliminary Results 2024 Presentation, Jul 30, 2024).
3.  **Organic Operating Margin:** A consistent decline relative to peers would suggest a loss of cost advantage or pricing power.
4.  **Market Share in Key Categories (Scotch, Tequila, Beer):** Loss of share in core categories points to weakening competitive position. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Feb 4, 2025).
5.  **Brand Marketing Investment as % of Sales:** A significant decrease could signal underinvestment, risking long-term brand equity.
6.  **Volume Growth:** Negative volume trends, especially in premium-and-above segments, could be an early indicator of shifting consumer preferences. (Preliminary Results 2024 Presentation, Jul 30, 2024).
7.  **Free Cash Flow:** A decline in FCF below the company's target of ~$3 billion signals operational or margin pressure. (Diageo plc 2025 20-F Filing, Aug 14, 2025).

### **Short Verdict**
Diageo possesses a wide economic moat, justifying a 3 / 5 rating. The moat is anchored by two powerful, mutually reinforcing advantages: a portfolio of world-class brands (Intangible Assets) and a vast, efficient global distribution network (Distribution & Efficient Scale). These are further protected by the high capital intensity and complex regulatory environment of the spirits industry. The low scores in dimensions like Network Effects and Switching Costs are typical for the industry and do not detract from its core strengths. A rating upgrade would require evidence of a unique data advantage or ecosystem, while a downgrade would be triggered by sustained market share losses and an inability to command premium pricing.
