### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Key guidance from the Q2 2025 earnings call on August 6, 2025:

*   **Enrollment Growth:** "GCE had another strong quarter, producing online enrollment growth of 10.1% and hybrid growth... of 15.4%." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 6, 2025)
*   **Revenue Growth:** "Service revenue was 247.5 million for the second quarter of 2025 an increase of $20 million or 8.8% as compared to 227.5 million for the second quarter of 2024." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 6, 2025)
*   **Future Outlook:** "We expect the new enrollment growth rate to remain up in the low to mid teens during the second half of 2025." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, Aug 6, 2025)

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

*   **Revenue Growth:**
    *   **Year 1:** 7.5%. This is based on the strong H1 performance and management's outlook for continued "low to mid teens" enrollment growth in H2 2025. This aligns with the most recent full-year growth rate of 7.50% for FY 2024.
    *   **Years 2-5:** Growth is projected to gradually decline from 7.0% to 5.5%, reflecting a normalization of growth as the base increases and for conservatism.
*   **Margin Path:**
    *   **Operating Margin:** Assumed to be stable at **27.0%**. This is slightly below the TTM operating margin of 27.15% and reflects a conservative stance, as management has not guided for specific margin expansion initiatives. The 3-year average operating margin is approximately 26.3%.
*   **Taxes:**
    *   The effective tax rate is assumed to be **22.0%**, consistent with the TTM rate of 21.87% and the 3-year historical average.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed to be **3.5% of revenue**, which is in line with the TTM capex of $36.9M on $1,068M revenue (3.45%).
    *   **Working Capital:** Change in Working Capital is modeled as **5.0% of incremental revenue**, based on historical averages.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, millions) | **Year 1** | **Year 2** | **Year 3** | **Year 4** | **Year 5** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $1,148 | $1,228 | $1,308 | $1,386 | $1,462 |
| *Growth* | *7.5%* | *7.0%* | *6.5%* | *6.0%* | *5.5%* |
| EBIT (27.0% margin) | $310.0 | $331.6 | $353.2 | $374.2 | $394.7 |
| Tax (22.0%) | ($68.2) | ($73.0) | ($77.7) | ($82.3) | ($86.8) |
| NOPAT | $241.8 | $258.7 | $275.5 | $291.9 | $307.9 |
| D&A | $39.2 | $40.5 | $41.8 | $43.0 | $44.2 |
| SBC | ($14.5) | ($15.0) | ($15.5) | ($16.0) | ($16.5) |
| Capex | ($40.2) | ($43.0) | ($45.8) | ($48.5) | ($51.2) |
| Chg. in WC | ($4.0) | ($4.0) | ($4.0) | ($3.9) | ($3.8) |
| **FCFF** | **$222.3** | **$237.2** | **$252.0** | **$266.5** | **$280.6** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.33%** (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.0%**. A standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Beta:** **0.80**. Sourced from public financial data, indicating lower volatility than the market average, which is reasonable for a stable, profitable education services company.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.33% + 0.80 * 5.0% = 8.33%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   The company has minimal interest expense, so the cost of debt is estimated based on the risk-free rate plus a credit spread. Assumed at **5.5%**.
    *   After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.5% * (1 - 22.0%) = **4.29%**
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Cap (Equity): $5.63 Billion
    *   Market Value of Debt: $107.8 Million (approximated by book value)
    *   **WACC = (5630 / 5737.8) * 8.33% + (107.8 / 5737.8) * 4.29% = 8.25%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   A terminal growth rate (g) of **2.5%** is used, reflecting long-term sustainable growth in line with expected inflation.
    *   **Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)**
    *   Terminal Value = ($280.6 * 1.025) / (8.25% - 2.5%) = **$4,999 Million**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   The company's historical EV/EBITDA multiple is in the 15-17x range. Using a conservative **15.0x** exit multiple on Year 5 EBITDA of $455M (EBIT + D&A) yields a terminal value of $6,825M. The Gordon Growth method provides a more conservative value and will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit Period FCFF:**
    *   Year 1: $222.3 / (1.0825)^1 = $205.4
    *   Year 2: $237.2 / (1.0825)^2 = $202.4
    *   Year 3: $252.0 / (1.0825)^3 = $198.5
    *   Year 4: $266.5 / (1.0825)^4 = $193.5
    *   Year 5: $280.6 / (1.0825)^5 = $188.5
    *   **Total PV of FCFF = $988.3 Million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $4,999 / (1.0825)^5 = **$3,358.5 Million**
*   **Enterprise Value (EV) = $988.3 + $3,358.5 = $4,346.8 Million**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($107.8M) - Cash ($373.9M) = -$266.1M
    *   **Equity Value = $4,346.8M - (-$266.1M) = $4,612.9 Million**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Fair Value per Share = Equity Value / Diluted Shares Outstanding**
    *   $4,612.9 Million / 28.7 Million shares = **$160.73 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$160.73**. Assumes 7.5% initial revenue growth declining to 5.5% and stable 27% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$125**. Assumes lower revenue growth (e.g., 4-5%) and margin compression to 25% due to increased competition or regulatory pressures.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$200**. Assumes sustained high single-digit revenue growth (7-8%) and modest margin expansion to 28% from operating leverage.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a 30% discount to the base-case fair value provides a target purchase price.
    *   **MOS Price = $160.73 * (1 - 0.30) = $112.51**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The for-profit education sector is subject to significant regulatory oversight from the Department of Education, which could impact funding, enrollment, and operating models.
2.  **Reputation and Brand Dependence:** The company's success is heavily tied to the reputation and brand of its key university partners, primarily Grand Canyon University. Any negative events at GCU could materially harm GCE.
3.  **Competition:** The online education market is intensely competitive, with numerous non-profit and for-profit institutions competing for students, which could pressure pricing and growth.
4.  **Enrollment Concentration:** A significant portion of revenue is derived from a limited number of university partners, creating concentration risk if any of those relationships were to change.

final answer is 160.73 $
