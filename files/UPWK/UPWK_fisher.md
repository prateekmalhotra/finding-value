Upwork Inc., August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Q2 2025 Earnings Release, 2024 10-K Report, Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork is positioning itself to capitalize on a stated $650 billion Enterprise Total Addressable Market (TAM) opportunity. The company is expanding its offerings to serve larger clients with a full suite of contingent workforce solutions. Growth in AI-related work is a significant tailwind, with Gross Services Volume (GSV) from this category growing 30% year-over-year in Q2 2025. The company's acquisition of Bubty and Ascen are intended to enhance its full-stack staffing solutions to better capture the enterprise market.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork is actively investing in AI and new product development. The company acquired Objective AI in November 2024 to enhance its AI-native search capabilities. It also recently introduced "Lifted," a subsidiary focused on enterprise clients, and appointed a new Chief Operating Officer to drive its next chapter of growth. The company's focus on AI is further demonstrated by the development of "Uma," its AI work agent.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork's R&D investments are showing tangible results in the form of new products and features that are driving growth in key areas. For example, AI-related GSV grew 30% year-over-year in Q2 2025, and clients engaging in AI work generate approximately three times the average GSV. The company's non-GAAP operating expenses, which include R&D, were 51% of revenue in Q2 2025, down from 58% in the prior year, suggesting improved efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork's sales efforts are showing strong results in the enterprise segment. GSV from Business Plus, its offering for larger SMBs, increased 190% and active clients increased 45% quarter-over-quarter in Q2 2025. The company is also making strategic acquisitions to enhance its full-stack offering for enterprise clients. The company's marketplace take rate increased to 18.0% in 2024 from 15.4% in 2023, driven by strategic changes in service fees and product offerings.
**Answer:** Yes

**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork has demonstrated significant improvement in its profitability. In Q2 2025, the company achieved a record 16.8% GAAP net income margin and a 29.3% adjusted EBITDA margin. The company's gross margin also reached a record 77.8% in Q2 2025.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has a stated goal of reaching a 35% adjusted EBITDA margin. The company is undertaking several initiatives to achieve this, including "rigorous cost discipline" and "continued cost optimization efforts, including internal investments in AI enablement." The company also announced a restructuring plan in October 2024 that included a 21% workforce reduction to improve efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In October 2024, Upwork announced a restructuring plan that included a 21% workforce reduction. While this was done to improve efficiency, such a large layoff can negatively impact employee morale. There is no other publicly available information to suggest either outstanding or poor labor relations.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork has recently made some key executive changes, including the appointment of a new Chief Operating Officer in August 2025. There is no evidence of executive turnover or instability. The company's recent strong performance and strategic initiatives suggest that the executive team is working effectively together.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork has a well-defined executive team with clear roles and responsibilities. The recent appointment of a new COO and the elevation of technology and legal leaders suggest a focus on building a strong management team for the next phase of growth. The company's ability to execute on its strategic initiatives and deliver strong financial results is a testament to the quality of its management team.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its 2024 10-K report, Upwork's management concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective. The company's auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, also issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements. There is no evidence of any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in the company's accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork's key competitive advantage is its network effect. As the world's largest work marketplace, it has a large and diverse pool of both clients and freelancers, which creates a virtuous cycle of growth. The company is also leveraging AI to enhance its platform and create a better user experience, which could further differentiate it from competitors. The 30% YoY growth in AI-related GSV indicates the strength of this moat.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork is focused on achieving its long-term target of a 35% adjusted EBITDA margin, while also investing in growth initiatives. The company is making strategic acquisitions and investing in AI and new product development to drive long-term growth, even if it means some near-term costs. The company's CEO, Hayden Brown, has stated that they are "building the foundation for accelerated multi-year growth."
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Upwork has a strong balance sheet with a healthy cash position and is generating strong free cash flow. Free cash flow for the second quarter of 2025 was $65.6 million. The company has been actively repurchasing shares, which is a sign of financial strength and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders. There is no indication that the company will need to raise equity in the foreseeable future.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management provides detailed financial results and guidance in its quarterly earnings releases and conference calls. They also discuss the risks and challenges facing the business in the "Risk Factors" section of their SEC filings. The Q2 2025 earnings call transcript shows a willingness to answer analyst questions directly.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of any legal or regulatory issues, scandals, or governance red flags involving Upwork or its management team. The company's 2024 10-K report does not list any material legal proceedings. The company has a code of conduct that applies to all employees and directors.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Upwork scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong positives in its market opportunity, commitment to innovation, improving profitability, and financial strength. The company is successfully navigating the evolving landscape of work and leveraging technology, particularly AI, to enhance its platform and drive growth. The primary negative is the uncertainty around labor relations following a significant workforce reduction. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful integration of its recent acquisitions and its ability to continue to gain traction in the enterprise market. A significant increase in enterprise client wins and a sustained high growth rate in AI-related work would be strong evidence to turn the already positive outlook even more favorable.

fisher score is 14 / 15
