Perimeter Solutions, Inc. (PRM), August 28, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, and earnings call transcripts.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Perimeter Solutions' Fire Safety segment benefits from strong secular tailwinds. The 10-year trailing average of acres burned in the U.S. has more than doubled from 3.3 million in 1997 to 7.5 million in 2024, and the U.S. fire season is now 105 days longer than in 1970. The expansion of the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), which now contains one-third of all U.S. homes, increases the need to protect lives and property from wildfires. Furthermore, there is a global regulatory push away from PFAS-containing firefighting foams, creating a significant market for the company's fluorine-free foam (FFF) alternatives.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company states its intent to maintain its market leadership position through continued investments in innovation and R&D. A key area of investment is in fluorine-free foam technology, where Perimeter has launched multiple new products like SOLBERG AVIGARD and VERSAGARD to capitalize on the industry's transition away from PFAS chemicals. The company is also expanding the application of its retardants for preventative use around critical infrastructure, creating a new use case beyond active fire suppression. In September 2023, its SOLBERG 3% MIL-SPEC SFFF became the first fluorine-free product approved on the military's Qualified Product List, demonstrating successful product development.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Perimeter Solutions does not disclose its Research & Development spending as a separate line item in its financial statements, making a quantitative comparison to peers impossible. However, the company provides qualitative evidence of R&D effectiveness. Its intellectual property portfolio as of December 31, 2024, includes 10 owned U.S. patents and 35 foreign patents for its Fire Safety business, covering key technologies in retardant and foam compositions. The successful development and qualification of new fluorine-free foams, including the first to be MIL-SPEC QPL approved, indicates an effective R&D function that can create products to meet new, demanding standards. Without specific R&D expenditure data, a definitive conclusion on efficiency cannot be reached.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales organization appears highly effective within its niche market, demonstrated by its dominant customer concentration. For fiscal year 2024, the USDA Forest Service and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management accounted for 34% and 11% of consolidated revenues, respectively. This indicates a deep, entrenched relationship and an ability to navigate complex government procurement processes successfully. The company operates a full-service, "turnkey" model for these key customers, providing not just the product but also specialized equipment, air base management, and emergency supply services to over 150 air tanker bases in North America, which serves as a significant competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Perimeter Solutions demonstrates very strong profitability. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported a gross profit margin of 56.5% ($317.1 million gross profit on $561.0 million of net sales). This is a significant increase from the 39.8% gross margin reported in the prior year. The Fire Safety segment, its largest, generated a Segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 55.0% in 2024, showcasing high profitability in its core business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company focuses on several key operational value drivers, including "pricing our products and services to the value they provide, and continued productivity improvements." For its key government contracts, the company utilizes value-based and dynamic pricing models, including tiered pricing, availability pricing, and annual price escalators. This structure helps cover fixed costs in lower-volume fire seasons and protects margins over time. In its MD&A, the company also notes that it takes actions with suppliers, such as aggregating purchase requirements and negotiating cost-reductions, to mitigate inflationary pressures.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, the company had 319 full-time employees. The company states that it has not experienced any employment-related work stoppages and considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory. Other than 24 employees in Germany who are represented by a works council, none of the company's employees are represented by a labor union. The company has implemented policies for health and safety, talent development, and non-discrimination. While this information is positive, there is no specific data provided (e.g., turnover rates, engagement scores) to classify relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a Founder Advisory Agreement with EverArc Founder Entity, which is owned and operated by the EverArc Founders, who are also directors of the company. This agreement provides for substantial fixed and variable advisory fees to be paid to the founders, partially in stock, which aligns their interests with shareholders to some extent. However, the agreement also includes a significant termination payment under certain circumstances and the fixed portion is earned even if shareholders experience negative returns, which could indicate a potential misalignment. The complexity and magnitude of this related-party agreement prevent a clear "Yes" answer.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's business is organized into two reporting segments (Fire Safety and Specialty Products) and five business units. Each business unit is led by a manager responsible for financial and operational results, which suggests a decentralized management structure and a layer of leadership below the executive level. However, the company's public filings primarily focus on the named executive officers and do not provide detailed information about the broader management team or succession planning. The "Risk Factors" section identifies "the loss of key personnel" as a potential risk that could inhibit growth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, KPMG LLP, provided an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2024, stating that they present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the company. The auditor also issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting as of the same date. The company provides segment-level financial data, offering some insight into its cost structure. There is no evidence of recent restatements or material weaknesses noted in the filing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage is the company's status as a supplier of USDA Forest Service qualified fire retardant, a standard many countries have adopted. The qualification process is rigorous and lengthy, creating a high barrier to entry. Perimeter's integrated business model is another significant differentiator; it provides a "full-service turnkey" solution that includes not only the retardant but also specialized air base equipment, management, and a rapid-response supply chain network capable of delivering product within hours. This comprehensive offering creates a significant moat against competitors who may only offer the chemical product itself.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's discussion emphasizes sustained growth through continued investment. The company states it intends to "continue to foster highly responsive and collaborative relationships with existing and potential customers" and expects demand for its products to grow. Investments in fluorine-free foam technology and the expansion into preventative retardant applications are indicative of a long-range focus. Earnings call transcripts consistently highlight long-term market trends like climate change and the expansion of the WUI as core drivers of the business, suggesting a focus beyond short-term results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025), https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PRM/transcripts/ (Accessed August 28, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company generated $188.4 million in cash from operating activities in fiscal 2024 and had $198.5 million in cash and cash equivalents at year-end. While the company has a $100 million revolving credit facility, it had no outstanding borrowings as of December 31, 2024. However, the Founder Advisory Agreement involves issuing stock for a significant portion of the advisory fees, which causes dilution. The company also has a share repurchase plan, which can offset dilution; it repurchased $14.4 million of stock in 2024. The strong cash flow suggests the company can fund operations, but the advisory agreement introduces a structural source of dilution.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of available earnings call transcripts from 2022 through 2025 shows a consistent pattern of communication from management. The calls typically include a prepared remarks section followed by a Q&A session with analysts, which is standard practice. The company openly discusses the seasonal nature of its business and the impact of fire season severity on its results. The "Risk Factors" section of the 10-K is extensive and details numerous potential challenges, including customer concentration and litigation. This level of disclosure suggests a willingness to communicate openly about risks.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025), https://discountingcashflows.com/company/PRM/transcripts/ (Accessed August 28, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is a defendant in a multi-district litigation related to alleged contamination from PFAS chemicals in firefighting foam products acquired via its Solberg business. While litigation is common in the chemical industry, being named in over 8,000 cases concerning environmental and health damages raises questions. Additionally, the Founder Advisory Agreement, while disclosed, represents a significant related-party transaction where company directors are beneficiaries of substantial fees. The structure of this agreement, particularly the large fees and termination payment, could be viewed as a governance concern. These factors prevent an assessment of "unquestionable" integrity.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1880319/000188031925000021/prm-20241231.htm (Filed February 20, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Perimeter Solutions scores well on criteria related to its market position, profitability, and long-term growth drivers. The company operates in a niche market with high barriers to entry and benefits from secular trends like climate change. Its strong margins and integrated business model are significant positives. The primary negatives and areas of concern revolve around corporate governance and potential liabilities. The Founder Advisory Agreement creates structural dilution and represents a complex related-party transaction. The ongoing PFAS litigation presents a significant, though currently unquantifiable, risk. Over the next 12-24 months, the score could be most impacted by a significant adverse or favorable development in the PFAS litigation. A shift to a more standard executive compensation structure away from the Founder Advisory Agreement would flip "Executive Relations" (Point 8) and "Equity Financing" (Point 13) to "Yes." Conversely, any negative audit opinions or findings of material weakness in controls would change the score for Point 10.

**fisher score is 9 / 15**
