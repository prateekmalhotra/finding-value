Company: Peloton Interactive, Inc. (PTON)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Peloton Interactive, Inc. FORM 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024; FORM 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2025; Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Peloton acknowledges the connected fitness market is relatively new and its growth is uncertain. Recent financial results show a significant slowdown, with Connected Fitness Products revenue declining 20.7% for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the prior year. The company's own forecast for fiscal year 2026 anticipates a 2% revenue decline at the midpoint, though it hopes for a return to growth after the first quarter. This challenging outlook, coupled with intense competition, suggests the path to a sizable increase in sales is not clear.
**Answer:** No

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Peloton's management shows a strong commitment to ongoing development, primarily through software and strategic partnerships. The company states it "seek[s] to continuously improve our Connected Fitness Products, as well as the Peloton App...through frequent software updates, iterations of feature enhancements, and innovations." Recent examples include the launch of AI-driven "Personalized Plans," AI-powered subtitles to aid international expansion, a pilot program to put Peloton content on Precor commercial equipment, and a new content licensing agreement with Google Fitbit. The company also recently created a Chief Technology Officer role to focus on AI innovation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Peloton's R&D spending remains a significant portion of its revenue, though it is decreasing. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, R&D expense was $178.4 million, or 9.5% of total revenue, down from 11.4% in the prior year period. While the company continues to release software updates and new features, its hardware development has faced significant challenges, including the costly recalls of its Tread+ treadmill and the seat post of its original Bike. The lack of major new, successful hardware introductions despite the high R&D spend raises questions about the overall effectiveness of these efforts.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales results indicate significant challenges. For the nine months ended March 31, 2025, Connected Fitness Products revenue declined 20.7% year-over-year. Ending Paid Connected Fitness Subscriptions fell from 3.05 million as of March 31, 2024, to 2.88 million as of March 31, 2025. As part of its restructuring, the company is reducing its direct retail showroom presence and shifting focus to third-party retailers like Amazon and Dick's Sporting Goods, a strategy whose long-term success is still unproven. These declining key sales metrics suggest the sales organization is not performing at an above-average level.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Peloton's consolidated profit margins are not yet worthwhile. The company reported a Net Loss of $551.9 million for fiscal year 2024 and a Net Loss of $140.5 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2025. While the Subscription segment boasts a strong gross margin of 68.2% for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, the Connected Fitness Products segment's gross margin was only 12.4% over the same period. The company's ongoing net losses demonstrate that, on a consolidated basis, its profit margins are insufficient.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is taking aggressive and decisive action to improve margins. The company is implementing its "2024 Restructuring Plan," which aims for over $200 million in annual run-rate expense reductions by the end of fiscal 2025. This plan includes a 15% reduction in global headcount and the continued closure of retail showrooms to lower operating expenses. The company has already improved its Connected Fitness gross margin from -17.6% in fiscal 2023 to +12.4% for the nine months ended March 31, 2025, showing these actions are having a positive effect.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has undergone several major restructuring events involving significant layoffs. The 2024 Restructuring Plan alone included a reduction of approximately 15% of the global headcount, impacting around 400 employees. In its 10-K filing, the company explicitly lists "reduced employee morale" and "personnel attrition beyond our planned reduction in headcount" as risk factors stemming from its restructuring initiatives. While the company is not subject to any collective bargaining agreements, multiple large-scale layoffs are indicative of strained, not outstanding, personnel relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There has been significant turnover at the highest level of the company. In connection with the CEO transition in fiscal 2024, the company recognized $41.9 million in stock-based compensation expense for accelerated vesting of the departing CEO's stock options. The Q3 2025 10-Q also notes $21.0 million in executive departure costs related to accelerated stock-based compensation and severance for individuals covered by the company's Severance and Change in Control Plan. High turnover and large separation packages for departing executives do not suggest outstanding executive relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Recent changes indicate a strengthening of the management team. While the company has experienced high-level turnover, including the CEO, recent announcements point to strategic hires. On June 12, 2025, Peloton announced the appointment of a new Chief Marketing Officer and the creation of a Chief Technology Officer role specifically to focus on AI, a key growth area. The investor relations page also lists a team of senior executives beyond the CEO, including a Chief Content Officer, Chief Supply Chain Officer, and Chief Legal Officer, suggesting a functional leadership structure is in place.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has self-identified and is actively working to remediate multiple material weaknesses in its internal controls over financial reporting. These include a material weakness related to the "existence, completeness, and valuation of inventory," and another related to the "business process control environment at Precor." The auditor's report in the 2024 10-K also expressed an adverse opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting due to these weaknesses. The existence of multiple, unresolved material weaknesses is a clear indicator that cost and accounting controls are not good.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Peloton's key competitive differentiator is its vertically integrated model combining hardware, software, and, most importantly, content with a strong community element. The company notes its "world-renowned Instructors coach and motivate Members," creating a loyal following that is difficult for competitors to replicate. This content-driven ecosystem creates a network effect and high switching costs for its most engaged users. Subscription gross margins of 68-69% demonstrate the value of this model, even as the hardware business struggles.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is currently focused on near-term survival and achieving positive cash flow, rather than sacrificing profits for long-term growth. The 2024 Restructuring Plan is explicitly designed to "position Peloton for sustained, positive free cash flow." The Q4 2025 earnings call emphasized the generation of $324 million in free cash flow for the year and a focus on cost savings. While the company continues to invest in R&D, the overwhelming evidence from its strategic initiatives and management commentary points to a primary focus on achieving near-term financial stability and profitability.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQF2jjoZzRjHspf5Ij0yatWse712MAS8t-7tFGtEFHoTylqaT9Obp3WLpVRppqjbMfNRwuzCbAaDDOcMVcHmF70KVtS_eqLuGR9OP-VWZ_ZcG-CCZnbsE19LGyBw104KpxTVlXvnSoxvG23Q0uzZQZcN26FWR-wrqb3w-Xknvfc=] (Accessed August 24, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position has improved but remains precarious. As of March 31, 2025, Peloton had $914.3 million in cash and cash equivalents. However, it still has significant debt, including a $992.5 million term loan and $549 million in convertible notes. While the company generated positive free cash flow in fiscal 2025, it still reported a net loss. A key risk factor listed in its 10-K is that the company has "incurred operating losses in the past, may incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future." Given the net losses and debt load, the risk of needing to raise capital via equity financing remains.
**Answer:** No

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management appears to be candid with investors about its challenges. The company's SEC filings contain an extensive "Risk Factors" section that details issues such as declining demand, restructuring challenges, and material weaknesses in internal controls. In its Q4 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed the revenue decline, the rationale behind its restructuring, and provided a detailed financial outlook, including a forecast for a near-term revenue decrease. This level of disclosure about ongoing problems suggests a commitment to transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are several issues that call management's integrity into question. The company is currently the subject of multiple shareholder lawsuits alleging false and misleading statements regarding product demand and safety. The SEC is investigating the company's disclosures related to the Tread+ recall. In December 2022, the company paid a $19.1 million civil penalty to the CPSC to resolve charges that it violated the Consumer Product Safety Act. These regulatory actions, penalties, and ongoing investigations are significant red flags.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982524000128/pton-20240630.htm) (Filed August 22, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1639825/000163982525000081/pton-20250331.htm) (Filed May 8, 2025)

**Synthesis:**

Peloton's Fisher score reflects a company in a difficult turnaround. Its primary strengths lie in its powerful brand and high-margin subscription business, built on a unique and hard-to-replicate content ecosystem (Point 11). Management is demonstrating a commitment to innovation, particularly in software and AI (Point 2), and is taking aggressive, necessary steps to cut costs and improve margins (Point 6). However, these positives are overshadowed by significant negatives. The company is facing declining hardware sales and a questionable long-term growth runway (Point 1). Ongoing net losses, material weaknesses in accounting controls (Point 10), high executive turnover (Point 8), and strained employee relations from mass layoffs (Point 7) are major concerns. Furthermore, regulatory penalties and shareholder lawsuits cast a shadow on management's integrity (Point 15).

The score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on two key variables. First, the success of the 2024 Restructuring Plan in achieving sustained positive free cash flow and improved hardware margins would flip "Worthwhile Profit Margins" (Point 5) and "Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook" (Point 12) to "Yes". Second, the company must stabilize its hardware sales and prove a path to renewed top-line growth through its software, AI, and commercial initiatives; clear evidence of this would change "Products/Services with Long Runway" (Point 1) to "Yes". To achieve this, Peloton would need to demonstrate consistent quarter-over-quarter growth in both Connected Fitness subscriptions and total revenue, alongside the successful remediation of its material weaknesses in internal controls.

**fisher score is 4 / 15**
