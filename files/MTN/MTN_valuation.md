Of course. The provided valuation is a solid and well-structured piece of analysis. However, as you've pointed out, some assumptions can be refined to better reflect market realities and the specific risks of the business. The primary areas for improvement are the discount rate (WACC), which appears too low for a consumer discretionary company, and the terminal value calculation, which is the most sensitive part of any DCF model.

Here is a revised analysis that addresses these points, building upon your original framework.

### **Critique of Original Analysis**

1.  **Discount Rate (WACC):** The original WACC of 7.7% seems low. The Beta of 0.90 suggests the stock is less volatile than the market, which is questionable for a high-end travel and leisure company highly dependent on economic cycles and consumer sentiment. A higher, more realistic Beta is warranted. Similarly, the Equity Risk Premium (ERP) of 5.0% is on the conservative end of the typical range used by analysts (5.0% - 6.0%).
2.  **Operating Margin:** The assumption of a flat 18.5% margin might be slightly too pessimistic. Given management's focus on "resource efficiency" and the company's strong pricing power, a modest, gradual improvement is a more probable scenario.
3.  **Terminal Value:** The original analysis uses a Gordon Growth model and cross-checks with an exit multiple that is nearly identical to the current multiple (9.9x vs. 10.05x). A more realistic approach for a terminal state is to assume the company will trade at a slightly lower multiple than it does today, reflecting its maturation into a slower-growth entity. Therefore, basing the primary valuation on a conservative **Exit Multiple** and using the Gordon Growth model as a check is a more robust methodology.

### **Revised Vail Resorts, Inc. (MTN) - Intrinsic Value Analysis**

**Date of Analysis:** August 24, 2025
**Reporting Currency:** U.S. Dollars (USD)

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

*(This section is unchanged as its purpose is to reflect the market's view at a point in time. The logic is sound.)*

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:** **$162.98** (at close, August 22, 2025).
2.  **Baseline Financials (TTM as of April 30, 2025):**
    (Identical to original)

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

*   **Preliminary WACC:** 7.5% (as used in original)
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%
*   **Tax Rate:** 25.6%

Holding the TTM operating margin of **18.7%** constant, the model must assume a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.5%** to arrive at the current market price.

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the stock price of $162.98, an investor must believe Vail Resorts can grow its revenue by **9.5% annually** for the next five years while maintaining its current operating margin of **18.7%**. This is an aggressive growth assumption.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on revised, more realistic assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The market's implied 9.5% growth is highly optimistic. A more balanced forecast is needed.

7.  **Revenue Growth (Years 1–5):**
    *   **Rationale:** The original tapering from 6% to 3% is a solid foundation. We will adjust the initial year slightly higher to 6.5% to better reflect continued pricing power on the Epic Pass, followed by a similar taper. This acknowledges both near-term strengths and long-term maturation.
    *   **Assumption:** **6.5%** (Y1), 5.5% (Y2), 4.5% (Y3), 3.5% (Y4), 3.0% (Y5).

8.  **Operating Margin:**
    *   **Rationale:** The original flat 18.5% margin is conservative. Given management's cost-cutting initiatives and scale advantages, a modest and gradual margin improvement is more realistic. We will model a gradual expansion from 18.6% to 19.0% over the forecast period.
    *   **Assumption:** **18.6%** (Y1), 18.7% (Y2), 18.8% (Y3), 18.9% (Y4), **19.0%** (Y5).

9.  **Tax Rate:**
    *   **Assumption:** **25.0%** (Unchanged, this is a reasonable normalized rate).

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Assumed at **8.5% of revenue**, consistent with guidance.
    *   **Working Capital:** Assumed as a use of cash equivalent to **1.5% of incremental revenue**. (Unchanged, assumptions are sound).

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Grown in line with revenue.
    *   **Share Count:** Net **1.0% annual reduction** in shares outstanding. (Unchanged, assumptions are sound).

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC) - REVISED**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** **5.5%**. (Revised up slightly to a more central market estimate).
    *   **Beta:** **1.15**. (Revised from 0.90). A Beta greater than 1.0 better reflects the company's sensitivity to economic cycles and discretionary consumer spending.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.15 * 5.5% = 10.59%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 6.2% * (1 - 25.0%) = **4.65%** (Unchanged).

16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Cap = $6,112M
    *   Enterprise Value = $8,350M
    *   Equity Weight = 73.2%; Debt Weight = 26.8% (Unchanged).
    *   **WACC = (73.2% * 10.59%) + (26.8% * 4.65%) = 7.75% + 1.25% = 9.00%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE - REVISED**

17. **Exit Multiple Method (Primary):**
    *   **Rationale:** This method grounds the terminal value in a realistic market valuation multiple for a mature company. A terminal multiple should logically be slightly lower than the current multiple, reflecting a transition to a more stable, lower-growth state.
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA** = Year 5 EBIT ($704M) + Year 5 D&A ($365M) = **$1,069M**
    *   **Assumed Exit Multiple:** **9.0x EV/EBITDA**. This is a realistic multiple for a stable market leader in the leisure industry, below the current multiple of ~10x.
    *   **Terminal Value = $1,069 M * 9.0 = $9,621 M**

18. **Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
    *   Let's see what long-term growth rate (`g`) is implied by our exit multiple:
    *   Implied g = (WACC * TV - FCFF_5) / (TV + FCFF_5)
    *   Implied g = (0.09 * $9,621 - $541) / ($9,621 + $541) = ($866 - $541) / $10,162 = **3.2%**
    *   An implied perpetual growth rate of 3.2% is on the higher end of reasonable but still plausible, giving us confidence that our 9.0x exit multiple is not overly aggressive.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF (using 9.0% WACC) = ($449/1.09) + ($477/1.09²) + ($502/1.09³) + ($521/1.09⁴) + ($541/1.09⁵) = $412 + $401 + $388 + $369 + $352 = **$1,922 M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $9,621 / (1.09⁵) = **$6,252 M**
    *   **Total Enterprise Value = $1,922 + $6,252 = $8,174 M**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt ($2,705M) - Cash ($467M) = **$2,238 M**
    *   **Equity Value = $8,174 M - $2,238 M = $5,936 M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Shares in Year 5 (with 1.0% annual reduction from 37.5M) = **35.6M shares**
    *   **Fair Value Per Share = $5,936 M / 35.6 M = $166.74**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $166.74.** Our most probable scenario.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $135.** Assumes lower revenue growth (4% tapering to 2%), margin compression to 17.5%, and a lower exit multiple of 8.0x.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $205.** Assumes stronger growth (8% tapering to 4%), margin expansion to 20.0%, and a higher exit multiple of 9.5x.

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 20% margin of safety from the base-case fair value is prudent.
    *   **MOS Price = $166.74 * (1 - 0.20) = $133.39**

### Risk Notes

*(Unchanged, the original risks are comprehensive and relevant)*

1.  **Economic Sensitivity:** As a premium travel and leisure company, Vail Resorts is highly sensitive to discretionary consumer spending.
2.  **Weather Dependency:** The business is fundamentally dependent on favorable weather conditions and sufficient snowfall. Climate change presents a significant long-term risk.
3.  **Competition and Pricing Power:** The ski industry is competitive. The ability to continually raise prices may be limited if consumers become more price-sensitive.
4.  **Integration Risk:** The company continues to acquire new resorts. Integrating these new operations carries execution risk.
5.  **Capital Intensity:** The business requires significant and continuous capital investment to maintain and upgrade its resorts.

final answer is 166.74 $
