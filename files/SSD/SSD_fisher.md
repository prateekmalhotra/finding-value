Simpson Manufacturing Co., Inc. (SSD), August 22, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC Filings, Earnings Call Transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Simpson's sales are closely tied to the housing market, particularly U.S. housing starts. While new residential construction is a mature market, the company is expanding into new product areas like mass timber and building technology, and has a growing presence in the repair and remodel market, which provides a degree of insulation from new construction cyclicality. The company's 2024 10-K notes that sales are dependent on the construction and housing markets, which are subject to cyclical downturns. However, the company is also expanding its product lines and geographic reach.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Simpson has a stated ambition to "innovate and re-imagine" its products, and has a track record of introducing new products and solutions. The company's investor presentations highlight a focus on innovation, and the company has made acquisitions to expand its product offerings, such as the acquisition of ETANCO in 2022. The 2024 10-K highlights the company's commitment to "a continuous stream of new and improved products".
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920371/000092037125000051/ssd-20241231.htm', 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920371/000092037124000163/ssd-20240630.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Simpson's R&D expenses as a percentage of sales are not explicitly broken out in their financial statements, being consolidated within "Selling, general and administrative expenses". This makes a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the company does emphasize its engineering and research capabilities in its filings, which contribute to product innovation and building code compliance. Without more specific data on R&D spending and output, it's difficult to definitively assess the effectiveness of their efforts relative to their size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/920371/000092037125000051/ssd-20241231.htm']

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?

The 2024 10-K states, "We believe our customers place a high value on the availability of our products, the quality and consistency of our service, and the technical and engineering support we provide." This indicates a strong focus on the customer-facing aspects of the business.

**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Simpson reported a gross profit margin of 47.1% and an operating income margin of 24.0%.

---
**Synthesis**
Simpson Manufacturing scores well on the Fisher checklist, with strong marks for its market position, profitability, and management team. The company's focus on innovation and its strong relationships with building code officials are key competitive advantages. The main areas for improvement are in providing more detailed disclosure on R&D spending and labor relations. A downturn in the housing market is the most significant risk to the company's financial performance in the next 12-24 months. A "No" on R&D effectiveness could be flipped to a "Yes" with more granular disclosure of R&D spending and metrics. Similarly, a "No" on labor relations could be flipped with more data on employee turnover and satisfaction.

fisher score is 13 / 15
