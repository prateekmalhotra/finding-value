**Charter Communications, Inc., August 21, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, and Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2025.**

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's core offering, high-speed internet, remains a crucial utility for both residential and commercial customers. The company is actively expanding its network through a subsidized rural construction initiative, aiming to add over 1.7 million new passings, which provides a clear path for subscriber growth. Furthermore, Charter's mobile service, Spectrum Mobile, is a key growth driver, having added 2.1 million lines in 2024. This bundled offering of internet and mobile services at competitive price points enhances customer retention and provides a significant cross-selling opportunity. The ongoing network evolution to deliver multi-gigabit speeds and the introduction of new services like Advanced WiFi and the Xumo streaming platform indicate a strategy to capitalize on increasing data consumption and evolving entertainment habits.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's management has demonstrated a clear commitment to ongoing development through its significant capital investments in network evolution and expansion. The company's plan to upgrade its entire footprint to multi-gigabit speeds by 2027, utilizing technologies like DOCSIS 4.0, is a testament to this commitment. Furthermore, the launch of SpectrumOne, which bundles internet, mobile, and WiFi, and the introduction of the Xumo streaming platform, showcases a focus on evolving product offerings to meet changing consumer preferences. The significant investment of $5.5 billion in its rural construction initiative since 2022 further underscores the company's dedication to expanding its serviceable footprint and driving future growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's R&D efforts are more focused on the deployment and enhancement of existing technologies rather than fundamental research. The company's network evolution plan, which involves upgrading to DOCSIS 4.0 and expanding fiber-to-the-home, reflects an effective strategy of leveraging industry-wide technological advancements. This approach allows Charter to enhance its service offerings without bearing the full cost and risk of foundational R&D. While specific R&D expenditure figures are not detailed as a separate line item, the company's capital expenditures on network upgrades and new product deployment, such as the Xumo platform, serve as a proxy for its investment in innovation.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm) (January 31, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's ability to consistently add mobile lines, with 2.1 million additions in 2024, demonstrates the effectiveness of its sales and marketing efforts, particularly in bundling services. The company utilizes a multi-channel sales approach, including inbound and outbound call centers, online sales, and retail stores, to reach a broad customer base. The "Life Unlimited" brand platform and simplified pricing strategy launched in 2024 are designed to enhance the effectiveness of these channels. However, the loss of 508,000 internet customers in the same period suggests challenges in a competitive market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm) (January 31, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the year ended December 31, 2024, Charter reported an operating margin of approximately 23.8% (Income from Operations of $13,118 million divided by Revenues of $55,085 million). The company's Adjusted EBITDA margin for the same period was approximately 41.0% (Adjusted EBITDA of $22,569 million divided by Revenues of $55,085 million). These margins indicate strong profitability and operational efficiency, particularly for a capital-intensive business. The consistent generation of significant free cash flow further supports the assessment of worthwhile profit margins.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm) (January 31, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter is actively taking steps to maintain and improve its profit margins. The company's focus on bundling higher-margin internet and mobile services helps to offset the declining profitability of its video business. The growth of Spectrum Mobile, which leverages an MVNO agreement with Verizon, allows for a capital-light expansion into the wireless market, contributing to margin expansion. Furthermore, the company's network evolution and digitization of customer service platforms are expected to drive operational efficiencies and reduce costs over the long term. The company's disciplined approach to programming costs, as evidenced by its recent negotiations with major content providers, also plays a crucial role in margin management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm) (January 31, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter has invested in its workforce by establishing a $20 per hour minimum wage for all hourly employees and has absorbed the full premium cost increase for employee healthcare for the last twelve years. The company also offers a 401(k) match and a retirement accumulation plan. Additionally, Charter provides tuition assistance and has a U.S. Department of Labor-certified Broadband Technician Apprenticeship Program. However, there have been some labor disputes in the past, and like any large company, it faces ongoing challenges in managing a large and diverse workforce.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm) (January 31, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Charter appears to be stable, with key leaders having been with the company for a significant period. The company has a clear succession plan in place, as evidenced by the smooth transition of Christopher Winfrey to the role of President and CEO. The executive compensation structure is aligned with shareholder interests, with a significant portion of compensation being performance-based. The average tenure of the management team is 5.1 years.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter has a deep and experienced management team with a clear division of responsibilities across its various business segments. The company's leadership includes executives with extensive experience in the telecommunications and media industries.

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly traded company, Charter is subject to the stringent accounting and reporting standards of the SEC, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The company's financial statements are audited by an independent registered public accounting firm, which has provided an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. The detailed segment reporting in the Form 10-K provides a good level of transparency into the company's cost structure and profitability by product line. There is no evidence of significant accounting issues or restatements in recent years.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm) (January 31, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's extensive and upgraded hybrid fiber-coaxial network is a key competitive advantage, providing a cost-effective path to delivering high-speed internet to a large portion of the U.S. The company's strategy of bundling internet, mobile, and video services creates a sticky customer relationship that is difficult for competitors to replicate. The company's scale and geographically clustered assets also provide operational efficiencies and a strong market position in its service areas. The MVNO agreement with Verizon for its mobile service is a capital-efficient way to compete in the wireless market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1091667/000109166725000034/chtr-20241231.htm) (January 31, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's significant investments in its network evolution and rural expansion initiatives demonstrate a long-range outlook. These multi-year projects require substantial upfront capital expenditures that may impact short-term profitability but are expected to drive long-term growth and shareholder value. The company's consistent share repurchase program also reflects a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, which is a sign of confidence in its long-term prospects. Management's commentary in earnings calls consistently emphasizes the long-term strategic rationale for its investments.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter has a strong track record of funding its growth through operating cash flow and debt, while simultaneously returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders through share buybacks. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the company generated $4.3 billion in free cash flow and repurchased $1.2 billion of its common stock. The company's access to both the investment-grade and high-yield debt markets provides it with ample financial flexibility to fund its capital-intensive projects without resorting to dilutive equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Charter's management team regularly engages with the investment community through quarterly earnings calls, investor conferences, and other events. The transcripts of these events show that management is generally forthcoming with information, both positive and negative. For example, in recent earnings calls, management has openly discussed the challenges in the broadband market and the impact of the end of the Affordable Connectivity Program. This transparency allows investors to make informed decisions about the company's prospects.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of any significant legal or ethical issues involving Charter's senior management team in recent years. The company has a code of ethics and business conduct that all employees are expected to follow. The board of directors has an independent audit committee that oversees the company's financial reporting and internal controls. While the company has faced some legal and regulatory challenges, as is common in the telecommunications industry, there is no indication of a lack of integrity at the highest levels of the organization.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis:**
Charter Communications scores well on the Fisher checklist, with its strongest positives being its extensive and improving network infrastructure, a successful and growing mobile business, and a clear long-term strategy focused on bundled connectivity services. The company's strong free cash flow generation and commitment to shareholder returns are also significant positives. The primary areas of concern are the intense competition in the broadband market, which has led to subscriber losses, and the ongoing decline of the traditional video business. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the rural expansion initiative in driving new subscriber growth, the ability to continue to scale the mobile business profitably, and the impact of the network evolution on the company's competitive position and financial performance. A sustained increase in broadband subscriber growth and a clear path to profitability for the mobile business would be the key evidence to solidify the "Yes" answers and potentially improve the overall score.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
