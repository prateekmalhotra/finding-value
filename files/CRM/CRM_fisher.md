### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce operates in the large and expanding Customer Relationship Management (CRM) market. The company's growth is driven by digital transformation initiatives and the increasing importance of AI-powered customer data platforms.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce consistently invests in developing new products and enhancing existing ones. The company is heavily focused on integrating generative and agentic AI across all its products. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the company introduced Agentforce, a new AI layer on its platform. In May 2025, Salesforce entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Informatica Inc., an enterprise cloud data management platform, for approximately $8 billion, demonstrating a commitment to enhancing its data capabilities. This focus on AI and data management is designed to drive future growth as core CRM functionalities mature.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, Salesforce's research and development expenses were approximately $5.5 billion, or 15% of total revenues. For the three months ended April 30, 2025, R&D expense was $1.46 billion, also representing 15% of revenue. This level of investment has fueled the development of key growth initiatives like Data Cloud and Agentforce AI, which are central to the company's strategy. The continuous rollout of new features and platform enhancements that are integrated across its product suite indicates a productive R&D function relative to the company's substantial scale.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm (March 5, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000030/crm-20250430.htm (May 28, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's consistent revenue growth and large customer base demonstrate a highly effective sales organization. As of April 30, 2025, the current remaining performance obligation (cRPO) was $29.6 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year, indicating a strong sales pipeline. The company's sales and marketing expenses for the quarter ended April 30, 2025, were $3.4 billion, reflecting its significant investment in go-to-market capabilities. The company reports a low attrition rate of approximately 8% as of January 31, 2025, which reflects successful customer retention and expansion efforts by the sales and customer success teams.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000030/crm-20250430.htm (May 28, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm (March 5, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce has demonstrated significant margin improvement. For the quarter ended April 30, 2025, the company reported an income from operations of $1.9 billion, yielding an operating margin of approximately 20%. This is an improvement from the 19% margin in the same period of the prior year. For the full fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, the operating margin was approximately 19%, up from 14% in the prior year, showcasing a strong positive trend.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000030/crm-20250430.htm (May 28, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm (March 5, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on profitable growth. The company initiated a restructuring plan in January 2023 that included workforce reductions and office space consolidation to reduce operating costs. These efforts continued into fiscal 2025. Management has stated it continues to "evaluate and operationalize future programs to drive further operational efficiencies, optimize its management structure and increase cost optimization efforts". The company expects sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenue over time through increased productivity and efficiency initiatives, including the use of AI.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce is frequently recognized as a top employer, appearing on lists such as Fortune's "100 Best Companies to Work For" for the 16th consecutive year in 2024. However, the company has undertaken significant restructuring, including a 10% workforce reduction announced in January 2023 and additional targeted reductions in fiscal 2025. While these actions are aimed at improving efficiency, large-scale layoffs can negatively impact employee morale and relations. The evidence is mixed, as the company receives accolades for its culture while also undergoing significant workforce changes.
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced notable executive turnover. Co-founder Parker Harris transitioned from Chief Technology Officer to CTO of Slack in January 2024. President and COO Brian Millham is scheduled to transition to an advisory role in March 2025, and President and CFO Amy Weaver will become a Special Advisor to the CEO in March 2025. While a degree of change is normal in a large organization, multiple high-level transitions in a short period can indicate instability in executive relations.
**Answer:** No

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce has a broad and experienced management team beyond the CEO, with executives leading key product areas and regions. The company's Form 10-K filed March 5, 2025, lists a deep bench of executive officers, including Presidents for various functions like Revenue, Product, and Engineering. The recent appointments of Robin Washington as the incoming President and CFO and other senior leaders suggest a focus on maintaining a deep leadership team capable of managing a complex global organization, despite recent turnover.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large accelerated filer, Salesforce is subject to stringent accounting and disclosure requirements. The company's independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. Management's report also concluded that internal controls were effective. The company provides detailed segment revenue data, although it operates as one operating segment, offering reasonable transparency into its cost structure and revenue drivers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce's key competitive advantage lies in its vast ecosystem and platform network effects. The Salesforce Platform and AppExchange, its enterprise cloud marketplace, create significant customer lock-in and a wide moat. This platform approach allows customers and third-party developers to build and integrate applications, deeply embedding Salesforce into their operations. The recent focus on Data Cloud and the introduction of Agentforce for AI-driven automation further strengthen this ecosystem by unifying customer data and extending the platform's capabilities, making it difficult for competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce has historically prioritized top-line growth and market share gains, often at the expense of short-term profits. However, since fiscal 2023, there has been a significant shift toward "profitable growth," including restructuring efforts and a focus on margin expansion. While the company is now more focused on profitability, its continued heavy investment in R&D for AI and strategic acquisitions like the planned purchase of Informatica show a willingness to make substantial long-term investments. This balanced approach suggests a commitment to durable, long-range profitability rather than maximizing short-term results.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000006/crm-20250131.htm (March 5, 2025), https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1108524/000110852425000030/crm-20250430.htm (May 28, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Salesforce has a strong financial position with significant cash flow and capital resources. For the quarter ended April 30, 2025, the company generated $6.5 billion in cash from operations. As of that date, it held $17.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company has actively returned capital to shareholders, repurchasing approximately $2.7 billion of common stock in the same quarter and initiating a cash dividend program. The planned acquisition of Informatica is expected to be funded with a combination of new debt and cash on hand, not equity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management, including CEO Marc Benioff, maintains a high public profile and communicates regularly with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor events, and media appearances. During periods of slower growth and activist investor pressure in late 2022 and 2023, the company communicated a clear plan to focus on profitable growth and addressed the challenges directly. The Q1 FY26 earnings call on May 28, 2025, provided detailed commentary on the "stabilized" but still measured buying environment. This consistent and open communication, even when discussing challenges, demonstrates candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no widespread or recent reports of significant scandals or integrity issues concerning Salesforce's senior executive team. The company's 10-K filing from March 5, 2025, details various legal proceedings, including litigation related to a former customer (Backpage) and a securities class action against Slack, but these do not directly implicate the integrity of Salesforce's current senior management. The company has been recognized as one of the "World's Most Ethical Companies" by Ethisphere for 15 consecutive years, as of 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

### Synthesis
Salesforce scores well on most of Fisher's points, demonstrating strong market potential, a commitment to innovation, improving profitability, and robust financial health. Its primary strengths lie in its dominant market position, expansive ecosystem, and clear strategy around AI and data, which provide a long runway for growth. The recent focus on margin discipline, combined with strong cash flow, allows for strategic investments without diluting shareholders. The main areas of concern are recent management instability and the potential impact of major workforce reductions on employee relations and culture, leading to "No" answers on those specific points.

The Fisher score is most likely to change in the next 12–24 months based on three key variables: the successful integration of Informatica, the market adoption and monetization of the Agentforce AI platform, and the stabilization of the senior executive team. A smooth integration of Informatica would solidify Salesforce's data management capabilities, a crucial element of its AI strategy. Strong commercial success from Agentforce would validate the company's heavy R&D investments and provide a new, high-growth revenue stream. Finally, a period of stability within the C-suite, with the new President & CFO and other leaders establishing a consistent long-term vision, would be critical to flipping the "No" on executive relations to a "Yes."
