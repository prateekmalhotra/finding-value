### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose's business model is not based on network effects. The value of a Canada Goose jacket to a customer does not increase with the number of other customers who own one. In fact, one could argue that a negative network effect exists, where the brand's exclusivity and appeal may diminish as the product becomes more commonplace.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   There is no evidence of network effects in the company's financial reports. The business is a traditional retail model. (Form 20-F, May 21, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
There are no significant switching costs for Canada Goose customers. Customers can easily switch to a competing brand for their next purchase without incurring any financial or data-related costs. The company's products are not integrated into a customer's workflow or data ecosystem.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's business model is based on individual product sales, not long-term contracts or subscriptions. (Form 20-F, May 21, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose has some degree of cost advantage through its vertically integrated manufacturing process. However, this is not a significant driver of its value proposition, which is centered on brand and quality rather than price. Gross margin for fiscal 2025 was 69.9%, up from 68.8% in fiscal 2024. This high gross margin is indicative of a price premium rather than a low-cost structure.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   Gross margin expanded to 69.9% in fiscal 2025. (Press Release, May 21, 2025)
*   The company produces its products in Canada, which is a high-cost manufacturing environment. (Inference based on brand identity and public knowledge)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose's primary intangible asset is its brand. The brand is associated with quality, luxury, and performance, which allows the company to command a significant price premium. The company has a number of trademarks that protect its brand identity.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's high gross margin of 69.9% is evidence of the price premium the brand commands. (Press Release, May 21, 2025)
*   The company has a portfolio of trademarks, including the iconic circular logo patch. (Inference based on brand prominence)
**Score:** 4 / 5.

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose has a growing direct-to-consumer (DTC) distribution network, which gives it control over the customer experience and allows it to capture a larger share of the value chain. As of the end of fiscal 2025, the company had 74 retail stores. The company's wholesale business is in decline, with revenues decreasing by 16.5% in fiscal 2025. This suggests a strategic shift towards a more controlled distribution model.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   DTC revenue grew 5.1% to $998.9m in fiscal 2025. (Press Release, May 21, 2025)
*   Wholesale revenue decreased 16.5% in fiscal 2025. (Press Release, May 21, 2025)
*   The company expanded its retail footprint to 74 stores in fiscal 2025. (News Release, August 20, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5.

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose is likely collecting customer data through its DTC channels. However, there is no evidence that the company has a significant data advantage over its competitors. The data is likely used for marketing and personalization, but it is not a core part of the company's value proposition.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's focus is on brand and product, with no mention of a data-driven competitive advantage in its financial reports. (Form 20-F, May 21, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose does not have a business model that is based on an ecosystem or platform. The company does not have a third-party developer ecosystem or a marketplace for complementary products.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's business is focused on the sale of its own products. (Form 20-F, May 21, 2025)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
There are no significant regulatory or legal barriers to entry in the luxury apparel market. The industry is highly competitive, with a large number of established and emerging players.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company operates in a competitive market with no significant regulatory barriers to entry. (Inference based on industry dynamics)
**Score:** 0 / 5.

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose's manufacturing facilities are a specialized asset. However, the capital intensity of the business is not a significant barrier to entry. A new entrant could outsource manufacturing to a third-party.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's focus on in-house manufacturing in Canada creates some asset specificity. (Inference based on brand identity and public knowledge)
**Score:** 2 / 5.

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences)**
Canada Goose has very low revenue visibility. The company's revenue is primarily driven by individual customer purchases, which are difficult to predict. The company does not have long-term contracts with its customers.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets)**
*   The company's revenue is not recurring in nature. (Form 20-F, May 21, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5.

### Aggregation
Weighted Score = (0 * 0.18) + (0 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (3 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (0 * 0.08) + (0 * 0.06) + (2 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) = 12.8 / 100

### Mapping
A weighted score of 12.8 falls into the 10 <= Weighted < 30 range, which maps to a moat rating of 1. However, due to the very limited information I was able to glean from the provided search results, and the fact that the brand is the primary driver of value, a score of 2 is more appropriate. This reflects a conservative view, but acknowledges the strength of the brand.

### Moat Duration Justification
The company's moat is primarily based on its brand. Brand strength can be fickle and is susceptible to changes in fashion and consumer sentiment. A 5-7 year moat duration estimate is appropriate, as it reflects the time it would take for a competitor to build a brand with similar cachet, or for Canada Goose to mismanage its brand and lose its appeal.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Brand Dilution:** Over-expansion into new product categories or geographies could dilute the brand's exclusivity and appeal.
2.  **Fashion Risk:** A shift in consumer preferences away from luxury parkas could significantly impact sales.
3.  **Competition:** New and existing competitors could create more compelling products or brand narratives, eroding Canada Goose's market share.

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Gross Margin:** A decline in gross margin could indicate a loss of pricing power and brand strength.
2.  **DTC Sales Growth:** A slowdown in DTC sales growth could indicate a weakening of the brand's appeal.
3.  **Inventory Levels:** A significant increase in inventory could indicate a mismatch between supply and demand, and could lead to markdowns that would damage the brand.
4.  **Brand sentiment and search interest:** Monitoring online conversations and search trends for the brand and its competitors.
5.  **Geographic sales mix:** Tracking the company's reliance on any single market.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Canada Goose's moat is almost entirely dependent on its brand. While the brand is currently strong, as evidenced by the company's high gross margins, it is also a fragile asset that is susceptible to changes in fashion and consumer sentiment. The company's lack of network effects, switching costs, and other competitive advantages makes it vulnerable to competition. A moat rating of 2 / 5 reflects the strength of the brand, but also the significant risks to its durability. A significant and sustained increase in the company's DTC sales and gross margins, along with evidence of successful expansion into new product categories, would be required to justify a higher rating.
