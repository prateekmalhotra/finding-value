Company: Ralph Lauren Corporation (RL)
Date of Analysis: August 20, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K for fiscal year ended March 29, 2025; Earnings Call Transcripts; various news and data sources.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren is executing a long-term growth strategy, "Next Great Chapter: Accelerate," focused on several vectors with significant market potential. The company is targeting underdeveloped product categories like women's apparel and outerwear. It is also driving substantial growth in international markets, particularly Asia, where fiscal year 2025 revenue grew 12.2% in constant currency. Furthermore, the strategic shift toward a global direct-to-consumer (DTC) model, which now accounts for approximately 67% of sales, provides a long runway for margin expansion and brand control. Morningstar forecasts 6% compound average annual sales growth in Asia over the next decade, with the region expected to be a key market due to the growth of luxury demand in China.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated a strong commitment to process and technology development. The company is in the early stages of a "large-scale multi-year global project" called the "Next Generation Transformation project" (NGT). This initiative is designed to transform core operations, including inventory management, supply chain, and retail operations, by redesigning processes and implementing a new suite of technology systems to support its DTC pivot. The company is also continuously investing in its "Digital Ecosystem" and scaling "Connected Retail" capabilities like Digital Clienteling and Buy Online-Pick Up in Store to enhance the consumer experience.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a fashion and apparel company, Ralph Lauren does not report traditional Research & Development (R&D) expenditures, which are embedded within SG&A. Its innovation is focused on product design, marketing, and process improvements rather than technological patents. The company's "Design with Intent" function aims to create authentic products, and it has successfully innovated in its marketing through high-profile partnerships like being the official outfitter for the U.S. Olympic Team and major tennis tournaments. However, without specific metrics on R&D spending or output relative to peers, it is not possible to verify that its efforts are more effective than competitors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has demonstrated an above-average sales strategy by successfully shifting its channel mix towards more profitable and brand-accretive Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) sales. In fiscal year 2025, RL's retail channel drove growth across all geographies, highlighted by a 10% increase in total comparable store sales on a constant currency basis. This growth was led by strong performance in digital commerce (+9%) and brick-and-mortar (+10%). This strategic pivot away from lower-margin wholesale, combined with a focus on elevating the brand and improving full-price sell-through, indicates a sophisticated and effective sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren reported strong and improving profit margins in fiscal year 2025. The gross profit margin was 68.6%, an increase of 180 basis points from 66.8% in the prior year. The operating profit margin was 13.2%, also up 180 basis points from 11.4% in fiscal 2024. One market data source noted that Ralph Lauren's net margin of 12.82% was higher than its competitors, which experienced an average revenue contraction while RL's revenue grew. These figures demonstrate both a high absolute level of profitability and a positive trend relative to the industry.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEaLPykBOq7uhd1EYzNjvuBFWrXeajPdy4FdpvGky9j1Bi9rgwOX-703INnNfzJ_ZFW4djPgeJqyUpvpeTMTzYQu8B3LaJ695E7PWNkyL0NyzzaV7ISA-Xjpi90Y0MXxtFsGFmYaZbCHSqmF-kw4DGVHg==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEaLPykBOq7uhd1EYzNjvuBFWrXeajPdy4FdpvGky9j1Bi9rgwOX-703INnNfzJ_ZFW4djPgeJqyUpvpeTMTzYQu8B3LaJ695E7PWNkyL0NyzzaV7ISA-Xjpi90Y0MXxtFsGFmYaZbCHSqmF-kw4DGVHg==)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively improving margins through its "brand elevation" strategy. A key driver is increasing Average Unit Retail (AUR), which reflects pricing power and a shift toward higher-value products. In fiscal 2025, gross margin improvement was explicitly driven by AUR growth, favorable geographic and channel mix (shifting to higher-margin DTC and international markets), and lower cotton costs. The company is also strategically reducing its exposure to the promotional North American wholesale and off-price channels, which further protects margin and brand value.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHadm7ddQRLr3SNJKaZMWVxCuNE8G7M-HgYgUvViRoLSq81fyQG6QuQj3VkggBXz3-L64XcBkTibyUea_VEejGsCuAckfjDEb85s6L6ulFznI9rbsTyIZYLVZ5Yy3yVkksuQV6ySrZbZKJxWZQz3zxJyZzsve01SgHjjjX5AnmmIi1edBT0rpcvj39fCVSSCwRTdnRngPWiz6YvUroRRQ4r82PJWx8EKOj4msCg-OxzwKfFM3bbaqRV9Zppj1DF4pqkRFaOdzstwXWCHd9m](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHadm7ddQRLr3SNJKaZMWVxCuNE8G7M-HgYgUvViRoLSq81fyQG6QuQj3VkggBXz3-L64XcBkTibyUea_VEejGsCuAckfjDEb85s6L6ulFznI9rbsTyIZYLVZ5Yy3yVkksuQV6ySrZbZKJxWZQz3zxJyZzsve01SgHjjjX5AnmmIi1edBT0rpcvj39fCVSSCwRTdnRngPWiz6YvUroRRQ4r82PJWx8EKOj4msCg-OxzwKfFM3bbaqRV9Zppj1DF4pqkRFaOdzstwXWCHd9m) (August 13, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Evidence suggests strong labor relations. The company's 2025 10-K details extensive "Human Capital" initiatives focused on belonging, equity, talent development, and employee well-being, including a global wellness program called THRIVE. A 2021 study by Great Place To Work® found that 84% of employees at Ralph Lauren say it is a great place to work, compared to a 57% average at a typical U.S. company. While some reviews on Comparably from May 2025 offer constructive feedback, 75% were positive. There is no mention of significant labor disputes in recent filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGCcF7Y9aaWiBkHutglh4D-hE7CcR6Xb5lTzWM-8ZIuJ4h9inPXfhJZWXGfW7bKort7MTuafjIlghVAkiBoecEbKH8cMmhT0yXFlieXg5G-n5VTlpAwFdyYNnwyNhZlfjBmORE_HSteleSGKONCrtJudH_qlRw=](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGCcF7Y9aaWiBkHutglh4D-hE7CcR6Xb5lTzWM-8ZIuJ4h9inPXfhJZWXGfW7bKort7MTuafjIlghVAkiBoecEbKH8cMmhT0yXFlieXg5G-n5VTlpAwFdyYNnwyNhZlfjBmORE_HSteleSGKONCrtJudH_qlRw=), [https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGjkVTNizPTkpBaboz6pwKAwrVpBQlvQhVGlc8Nf2GLE2Ar-sLZ-w8ilF4WoOEUG4vhrQw7WNDq6jiFwPo-_SZQBGe70TiCKRqpnklWu33FjGcjAzZLpIWCjQ4SG8S4oH5p3hZJsJkHMwfO6fS1GZ37nkv0L_56tHU-a5o1FYAWtQ==](https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQGjkVTNizPTkpBaboz6pwKAwrVpBQlvQhVGlc8Nf2GLE2Ar-sLZ-w8ilF4WoOEUG4vhrQw7WNDq6jiFwPo-_SZQBGe70TiCKRqpnklWu33FjGcjAzZLpIWCjQ4SG8S4oH5p3hZJsJkHMwfO6fS1GZ37nkv0L_56tHU-a5o1FYAWtQ==)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team appears stable and well-structured, combining long-term vision with experienced operational leadership. Mr. Ralph Lauren remains Executive Chairman and Chief Creative Officer, providing brand continuity, while CEO Patrice Louvet has been in his role since 2017. Key leaders in the COO and CFO roles are long-tenured employees promoted from within the company, which indicates a healthy environment for executive talent development and retention. The controlling ownership by the Lauren family ensures stability in the company's direction.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Ralph Lauren has demonstrated considerable management depth. The 2025 10-K lists a detailed executive team beyond the CEO, including a Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Branding and Innovation Officer, and Chief Product & Merchandising Officer. Recent promotions of company veterans into top roles, such as Justin Picicci to CFO in May 2024 and Robert Ranftl to COO in April 2025 after successful stints leading regions like North America and Asia, showcase a strong internal talent pipeline and effective succession planning.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's accounting controls appear robust. In its fiscal 2025 10-K, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective, a conclusion supported by an unqualified opinion from its independent auditor, Ernst & Young LLP. The company provides clear, disaggregated financial reporting by geographic segment (North America, Europe, Asia) and by channel (Retail, Wholesale, Licensing). There is no history of major financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key indicator of an outstanding apparel brand is its ability to maintain brand equity and pricing power. Ralph Lauren's strategy to "elevate the brand" is a crucial competitive clue. This is evidenced by its focus on increasing Average Unit Retail (AUR), reducing its presence in the highly promotional North American wholesale channel, and expanding its own DTC footprint. This allows the company to control its brand narrative, customer experience, and profitability in a way that competitors reliant on third-party retailers cannot, giving it a significant long-term advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear long-range focus. The company is making substantial investments in its multi-year "Next Generation Transformation project" which incurred $25.2 million in charges in fiscal 2025, prioritizing long-term operational efficiency over short-term earnings. The company also increased marketing investments and SG&A expenses in fiscal 2025 to support "key campaign events" and its DTC expansion, trading near-term margin pressure for long-term brand building and growth. This consistent narrative around strategic, multi-year initiatives points to a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is exceptionally strong, posing no foreseeable risk of dilutive equity financing. As of March 29, 2025, the company had a net cash position of $940.4 million and generated $1.235 billion in cash from operations during the fiscal year. Instead of issuing shares, Ralph Lauren is aggressively returning capital to shareholders, having repurchased $480.9 million of its stock in fiscal 2025. Furthermore, the Board of Directors authorized an additional $1.5 billion for the share repurchase program on May 15, 2025, underscoring its financial strength and commitment to avoiding dilution.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor through its detailed public filings. The "Risk Factors" section of the fiscal 2025 10-K is comprehensive and specific, openly discussing potential negative impacts from tariffs, supply chain disruptions, intense competition, and macroeconomic pressures. The MD&A section also provides a balanced view, celebrating successes in brand elevation and DTC growth while also acknowledging challenges like inflationary pressures and the highly promotional retail environment in North America. This level of detailed disclosure in its primary investor communication document indicates a culture of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1037038/000103703825000011/rl-20250329.htm) (May 22, 2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** While the company's record is not perfect, recent evidence does not suggest a lack of integrity at the senior management level. The company resolved a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) investigation in 2013, which it self-disclosed and for which it enhanced its compliance programs. More recently, the company has faced class-action lawsuits related to product materials and outlet store pricing, which are not uncommon in the retail industry. The 10-K filing from May 2025 affirms that current legal proceedings are not expected to have a material impact, and the company maintains a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. The preponderance of recent evidence supports management integrity, though the ongoing lawsuits prevent a perfect score.
**Answer:** No

**Synthesis:**
Ralph Lauren Corporation scores well on Fisher's checklist, demonstrating strong fundamentals rooted in a clear, long-term strategic vision. The company's primary strengths are its powerful brand equity, robust and improving profitability, and a pristine balance sheet that allows for significant capital return to shareholders. Management has shown discipline in executing its "brand elevation" strategy by shifting to a more profitable DTC model and investing in long-term process improvements. The two "No" answers stem from a lack of specific R&D metrics common in the apparel industry and the presence of routine consumer class-action lawsuits that prevent a score of "unquestionable" integrity. The most critical variable that could change the score in the next 12–24 months is the macroeconomic environment; a significant consumer downturn could test the durability of its pricing power (AUR growth) and margin expansion. Evidence that would flip the "Integrity" score to "Yes" would be the successful resolution of outstanding class-action litigation without findings of wrongdoing.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
