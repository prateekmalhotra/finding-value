**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate's focus on professional-oriented curriculum in high-demand fields like healthcare and STEM gives it a competitive advantage. The company operates 23 medical and nine dental schools, which are difficult to establish and validate the quality of its institutions.

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate's strategy of investing in new campuses and expanding its online and hybrid programs demonstrates a long-term growth outlook. The company's status as a public benefit corporation, which requires it to consider the impact of its decisions on students and communities, also suggests a long-term perspective. However, the company also has a share repurchase program, which could be seen as prioritizing short-term shareholder returns over long-term investment. The company's guidance for revenue and adjusted EBITDA growth in 2025 suggests a balanced approach between growth and profitability.
**Answer:** Yes

The company is generating strong cash flow from operations, with $131.8 million in the first six months of 2025.

**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Laureate holds regular earnings conference calls and provides detailed financial information in its SEC filings. The Q2 2025 earnings call transcript shows that management addressed both positive and negative aspects of the company's performance, such as the EPS miss and the impact of foreign exchange rates. The company provides detailed risk factors in its 10-K, including the risks associated with operating in Mexico and Peru.
**Answer:** Yes

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/912766/000162828025006557/laur-20241231.htm) (December 31, 2024)

Synthesis:
Laureate Education scores well on the Fisher 15-point checklist, with strong positives in its market opportunity, commitment to growth, profitability, and financial strength. The company's focus on the underserved higher education markets in Mexico and Peru provides a long runway for growth, and management is actively investing in new programs and campuses to capture this opportunity. The company's strong margins and cash flow allow it to fund its growth initiatives without diluting shareholders. The primary variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the political and economic environments in Mexico and Peru, as well as the successful execution of the company's expansion plans. A significant downturn in the economies of these countries could impact enrollment and tuition rates, while any delays or cost overruns in the opening of new campuses could negatively impact the company's growth and profitability. To maintain its high score, Laureate will need to continue to demonstrate its ability to navigate the risks of operating in emerging markets while executing on its growth strategy.

fisher score is 15 / 15
