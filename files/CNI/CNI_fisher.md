### FISHER’S 15 POINTS

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a major North American railroad, CN's services are fundamental to the continent's economy, transporting over 300 million tons of natural resources, manufactured products, and finished goods annually. The company's extensive 20,000-mile rail network, connecting three coasts, provides a durable competitive advantage. Growth is tied to the broader economic expansion of North America. CN is pursuing growth through initiatives like intermodal partnerships and expanding its agricultural traffic capabilities. The company anticipates low to mid-single-digit growth in Revenue Ton-Miles (RTMs) for 2025, reflecting modest but steady market potential.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CN's management demonstrates a commitment to development through strategic capital investments and technological advancements. The company plans a capital program of approximately C$3.4 billion for 2025, focusing on network efficiency and capacity. Management is also focused on digital initiatives, such as leveraging data and analytics to enhance customer experience and optimize railway operations, as evidenced by the roles of a Chief Data Officer and a Chief Information and Technology Officer. Partnerships, like the INRD-CN intermodal collaboration, and efforts to improve freight movements with the Port of Vancouver, further illustrate a commitment to process and service development.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a railroad, CN's "R&D" is more focused on operational efficiency, safety technologies, and sustainability rather than traditional product development. The company's 2024 annual report details investments in track and railway infrastructure maintenance, including rail and bridge improvements, totaling $1.564 billion. CN is also investing in the development of new locomotive propulsion technology and renewable fuels to meet its climate goals. However, specific metrics to evaluate the effectiveness of these efforts, such as patent generation or direct R&D as a percentage of revenue, are not disclosed in the same way as in technology or pharmaceutical companies.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CN's sales efforts are deeply integrated with its commercial and operational teams, focusing on key commodity segments. In Q1 2025, the company saw revenue growth in Coal (+9%) and Grain & Fertilizers (+7%), indicating strength in these areas. The company's ability to achieve an 8% increase in diluted EPS with only a 1% rise in RTMs suggests effective pricing strategies and cost management, which are key components of a successful commercial organization. However, without specific data on customer retention, win rates, or sales productivity, a definitive "above-average" assessment is difficult.

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, CN consistently maintains strong profit margins. For the full year 2024, the company reported an operating ratio of 63.4% and an adjusted operating ratio of 62.9%. In Q1 2025, despite challenging weather, the operating ratio improved by 20 basis points to 63.4%, indicating resilient profitability. These figures are indicative of a company with significant operating leverage and efficient cost management, resulting in worthwhile profit margins.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on margin improvement through cost control and operational efficiency. The Q1 2025 results highlighted the company's success in "right-sizing resources and maintaining tight cost control." The improvement in the operating ratio, a key efficiency metric, demonstrates this focus. The company's strategy, as articulated by CEO Tracy Robinson, emphasizes operational resilience and leveraging the company's operating model to drive growth and efficiency.

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 annual report mentions labor negotiations and potential disruptions as a significant risk factor. Recent history includes labor-related disruptions in 2024. While the company has a Code of Business Conduct and reports on safety metrics, the recurring nature of labor negotiations and potential for disruptions indicates that labor relations are a persistent challenge rather than "outstanding."

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CN's financial reporting appears robust and transparent. The company provides detailed segment information and key performance indicators in its financial reports. The auditor's opinion on the 2024 consolidated financial statements was unqualified, stating that the financial statements "present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company." Furthermore, the auditors confirmed that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the railroad industry, the quality and reach of the network are paramount. CN's unique three-coast network, spanning approximately 20,000 miles from the Atlantic to the Pacific and down to the Gulf of Mexico, is a significant competitive advantage. This extensive network allows CN to serve as a crucial link in the transcontinental supply chain, a feat not easily replicated by competitors. The company's consistent focus on operational efficiency, as measured by its operating ratio, is another key indicator of its competitive strength.

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CN's management provides both near-term and long-term guidance, indicating a balanced approach to profitability. The company has a 2025 target of 10%-15% adjusted diluted EPS growth, as well as a longer-term target of high single-digit compounded annual adjusted diluted EPS growth for the 2024-2026 period. This, combined with a significant capital investment plan of C$3.4 billion for 2025, demonstrates a willingness to invest for future growth while still delivering near-term results.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CN has a strong financial position with a solid track record of generating free cash flow. In Q1 2025, the company generated over $600 million in free cash flow, an increase of $100 million from the previous year. The company has a stated leverage target of 2.5x adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA and plans to initiate a share buyback program, indicating confidence in its financial strength and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders rather than diluting them.

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management appears to be candid with investors. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, they openly discussed the challenges faced during the quarter, including "a more normalized Q1 weather pattern" and the recovery from those challenges. They also acknowledged the heightened risk of a recession and are closely monitoring the economic situation. This willingness to discuss both positive and negative factors suggests a high degree of transparency with the investment community.

The auditor's unqualified opinion on the financial statements and internal controls provides confidence in the integrity of the company's financial reporting. There is no evidence in the provided sources of any significant legal or regulatory issues, governance red flags, or related-party transactions that would call into question the integrity of the management team.

**Synthesis:**
Canadian National Railway scores well on the Fisher checklist, demonstrating the durable competitive advantages of its extensive three-coast rail network, consistent profitability, and a strong financial position. The management team appears stable, deep, and transparent with investors, with a clear focus on long-term growth and efficiency. The primary areas of concern are the lack of specific metrics to definitively assess R&D and sales effectiveness in a traditional sense, and the inherent challenges of labor relations in the railroad industry. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to successfully navigate labor negotiations without significant disruptions and its success in leveraging its capital investments to drive volume growth beyond the low single digits. A "No" on labor relations could flip to a "Yes" with a long-term agreement and a period of labor stability.
