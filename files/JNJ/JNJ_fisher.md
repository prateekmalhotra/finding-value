### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson's Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments are positioned in large, growing markets. The Innovative Medicine pipeline includes multiple assets with blockbuster potential, such as treatments in oncology and immunology. The MedTech segment is a global leader in areas like surgery, orthopaedics, and vision, benefiting from an aging global population and the increasing demand for healthcare. For example, sales in the MedTech segment grew 4.5% operationally in the second quarter of 2025, driven by electrophysiology products and contact lenses. Management has also highlighted its focus on durable, high-growth end markets.

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J maintains a strong commitment to R&D and strategic acquisitions to fuel future growth. The company invested over $15 billion in R&D in 2024. Management's capital allocation strategy prioritizes reinvestment in the business. A key example is the recent acquisition of Shockwave Medical, which strengthens J&J's cardiovascular portfolio in high-growth markets.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson's R&D spending as a percentage of sales was approximately 17.7% in 2024, a significant commitment for a company of its size. This investment has yielded a productive pipeline, with the company aiming to launch over 20 novel therapies by 2030, more than 10 of which have peak sales potential exceeding $5 billion. This level of productivity and the ambitious sales targets for its pipeline products indicate an effective R&D organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J’s global commercial infrastructure is a key competitive advantage, enabling broad market access and strong sales execution. The company's sales have shown consistent growth across diverse geographies, with Q2 2025 sales reaching $22.7 billion. The company's ability to drive growth in key products, such as a 23% operational sales increase in DARZALEX, highlights the effectiveness of its specialized sales and marketing teams. This global reach and consistent commercial execution indicate a high-quality sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson consistently maintains strong profitability. For the full year 2024, the company reported a gross profit margin of 68.6% and a net earnings margin of 18.2%. In the second quarter of 2025, the net earnings margin was approximately 21.6%. These margins are robust and demonstrate the company's ability to generate significant profits from its sales.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through portfolio optimization and cost discipline. A major strategic action was the separation of the Consumer Health business (now Kenvue), which allows J&J to focus on the higher-margin Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. Additionally, the company is realizing cost savings from restructuring initiatives and is focused on shifting its portfolio toward higher-growth, higher-margin products.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson employed approximately 134,000 people as of year-end 2024. The company emphasizes its commitment to its employees in its credo and is often cited as a top employer. While large corporations inevitably face some labor-related lawsuits or disputes, there is no evidence of widespread, systemic labor problems that would indicate poor relations. The company’s ability to attract and retain talent to drive innovation suggests a generally positive relationship with its workforce.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J's executive team demonstrates stability and a clear succession plan, as evidenced by the smooth transition of Joaquin Duato to the CEO role in 2022. The executive team has a long tenure with the company, indicating stability and internal alignment. Executive compensation is tied to performance, aligning the interests of management with those of shareholders. There is no public evidence of significant infighting or instability at the senior executive level.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Johnson & Johnson's decentralized management structure fosters a deep bench of experienced leaders. The company has dedicated and experienced leadership teams for its Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments, as well as for its major geographic regions. The company has a history of promoting from within, suggesting a strong pipeline of management talent is being cultivated. This structure mitigates key-person risk and ensures continuity.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a large, multinational corporation, J&J has sophisticated accounting and control systems. The company's annual financial statements receive an unqualified opinion from its independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, indicating that the financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP. The company provides detailed segment reporting, offering transparency into the performance of its different businesses. There is no recent history of material accounting restatements or identified weaknesses in internal controls.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J's key competitive advantages include its immense scale, which provides significant leverage in purchasing, manufacturing, and distribution. Its long-standing relationships with healthcare providers and regulatory bodies globally are difficult to replicate. Furthermore, the company's scientific expertise and ability to execute large-scale clinical trials are crucial differentiators in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries. These factors create a powerful moat around its businesses.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's consistent emphasis on its long-term pipeline and strategic R&D investments demonstrates a long-range focus. The company's capital allocation strategy prioritizes internal R&D and value-creating acquisitions over short-term profit maximization. For over 60 consecutive years, J&J has increased its dividend, which requires a long-term, stable approach to financial management and reflects confidence in future earnings power.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J has a very strong balance sheet and generates substantial cash flow. As of June 29, 2025, the company held $25.8 billion in cash and marketable securities. It generated over $18 billion in operating cash flow in 2024. The company has a long history of returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, not issuing shares. Its high credit rating allows it to access debt markets at favorable rates for large acquisitions if needed.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm' (Annual Report 2024), February 19, 2025., 'https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000178/jnj-20250629.htm' (Q2 2025 10-Q), July 22, 2025.]

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** J&J's management maintains a regular and open dialogue with investors through quarterly earnings calls, investor presentations, and SEC filings. During earnings calls, management addresses analyst questions on a wide range of topics, including challenges and setbacks. However, communications regarding its extensive and ongoing talc litigation have been managed carefully through legal channels. While transparent on operational matters, the legal complexities of the talc issue have naturally constrained their public commentary on that specific topic. The evidence of candor on business operations is strong, but the legal issues present a caveat.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/JNJ/transcripts/' (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript), July 22, 2025.]

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** This is the most challenging point for Johnson & Johnson. The company faces significant litigation related to its talc-based baby powder, with allegations that it contained asbestos and caused cancer. J&J has also been a defendant in litigation related to the opioid crisis and other product liability claims. While the company maintains the safety of its products and defends itself in court, the sheer volume and severity of these legal challenges, and the associated reputational damage, mean that its management cannot be described as having "unquestionable" integrity at this time.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/200406/000020040625000038/jnj-20241229.htm' (Annual Report 2024, see Note 21 on Legal Proceedings), February 19, 2025.]

---
Synthesis:
Johnson & Johnson scores well on most of Fisher's points, reflecting its status as a blue-chip leader in the healthcare industry. Its strengths are its durable product portfolios, significant and effective R&D engine, strong financial health, and disciplined, long-term management approach. The company is well-positioned for future growth, driven by its robust pipeline and strategic focus on the high-margin Innovative Medicine and MedTech sectors. The primary detractor from a perfect score is the significant, ongoing product litigation, particularly concerning talc, which prevents a "Yes" on unquestionable integrity. Over the next 12–24 months, the key variables that could change the score are the outcomes of major clinical trials for pipeline drugs and, most significantly, a comprehensive legal settlement of the talc litigation. A definitive and manageable resolution to the talc issue would be the most critical factor in flipping the only "No" to a "Yes".

fisher score is 14 / 15
