### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a specialty retailer, Natural Grocers does not have traditional R&D expenses like a technology or pharmaceutical company. Its "R&D" is focused on merchandising, product selection, and store format. There are no specific R&D expenses detailed in the financial statements.
**Answer:** No

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

This indicates an effective in-store sales strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the company's gross margin was 30.3% and its net income margin was 3.9%. Gross margin increased from 29.3% in the same period of the prior year, driven by higher product margin attributed to effective promotions. While the net margin is relatively low, which is typical for the grocery industry, the gross margin is healthy and improving.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547459/000143774925015486/ngvc20250331_10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547459/000143774925015486/ngvc20250331_10q.htm) (May 8, 2025)

In the three months ended March 31, 2025, gross margin increased to 30.3% from 29.3% in the prior year, with the increase "driven by higher product margin primarily attributed to effective promotions." Additionally, store expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased, reflecting expense leverage.

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-Q filing notes that the labor market has impacted its ability to retain and attract store crew members and that it has invested in increased wages. While these investments are positive, the commentary suggests that, like many retailers, they face challenges in this area. There is no specific disclosure of employee turnover or engagement metrics.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547459/000143774925015486/ngvc20250331_10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547459/000143774925015486/ngvc20250331_10q.htm) (May 8, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's leadership includes members of the Isely family, who are founders and major shareholders, suggesting a stable and aligned leadership team. The 10-Q also notes that during the six months ended March 31, 2025, the company accelerated the vesting of certain restricted stock units upon the retirement of the Company's former Chief Financial Officer, making them fully vested, resulting in incremental share-based compensation expense of $0.5 million.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547459/000143774925015486/ngvc20250331_10q.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1547459/000143774925015486/ngvc20250331_10q.htm) (May 8, 2025)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy of investing in new stores and remodeling existing ones suggests a focus on long-term growth. The MD&A section states that the company plans to continue to open new stores and enter new markets. These investments can impact short-term profitability but are essential for long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, the company had $21.2 million in cash and cash equivalents and $70.3 million available for borrowing under its credit facility. Net cash provided by operating activities was $36.7 million for the six months ended March 31, 2025. The company also has an active share repurchase program. This strong liquidity position suggests that the company can fund its growth without significant equity dilution.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company regularly holds earnings calls and provides detailed financial information in its SEC filings. The MD&A section of the 10-Q discusses industry trends and risks, such as competition and labor market challenges.

Synthesis: Natural Grocers by Vitamin Cottage, Inc. scores well on Fisher's 15 points, with strong positives in its market opportunity, sales growth, profitability, and financial strength. The company is well-positioned in the growing natural and organic food market and has a clear strategy for growth through new store openings and increased sales at existing stores. The primary areas of weakness or lack of information are in R&D effectiveness, labor relations, and management depth. The score is most likely to be impacted in the next 12-24 months by the company's ability to successfully execute its store expansion plans, maintain its sales momentum in a competitive market, and manage labor challenges. A "No" could flip to a "Yes" for labor relations with more disclosure on employee metrics and for management depth with more information on the executive team beyond the co-president and CFO.

fisher score is 12 / 15
