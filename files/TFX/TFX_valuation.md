### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

The following guidance was provided in the company's fourth-quarter 2024 earnings release.

*   **Full Year 2025 Revenue Growth:** "On an adjusted constant currency basis...the Company expects full year 2025 revenue growth of 1.00% to 2.00% year-over-year." (Q4 2024 Earnings Release, February 27, 2025).
*   **Full Year 2025 EPS:** "The Company expects full year 2025 GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $8.85 to $9.25." (Q4 2024 Earnings Release, February 27, 2025).

---

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

**1. Revenue Forecast:**
*   **Year 1 (2025):** 1.5% growth, the midpoint of management's guidance of 1.0% to 2.0%. (Q4 2024 Earnings Release, February 27, 2025).
*   **Years 2-5 (2026-2029):** A growth rate of 3.0% is assumed. This reflects a conservative estimate below historical averages, factoring in potential end-market challenges and a normalization of growth post-acquisition integrations.

**2. Margin Path:**
*   **EBIT Margin:** TTM EBIT was significantly impacted by a one-time $240 million goodwill impairment. Normalizing for this, TTM EBIT would be approximately $391 million ($151M + $240M), for a normalized margin of 12.8%. We will assume a stable EBIT margin of **13.0%** across the forecast period, reflecting management's focus on operational efficiency offsetting inflationary pressures. This aligns with historical performance absent major one-time charges.

**3. Taxes:**
*   The effective tax rate for 2024 was 7.0%, heavily influenced by the non-deductible goodwill impairment. The prior year's rate was 17.6%. An average effective tax rate of **18.0%** will be used, normalizing for one-time events and aligning with recent history.

**4. Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** TTM Capex was 4.1% of revenue ($126.4M / $3,047.3M). We assume Capex will remain at **4.0% of revenue** annually, in line with historical trends.
*   **Working Capital:** The TTM change in working capital was a source of cash. Based on historical averages, we assume the change in working capital will be **5.0% of the change in revenue** each year, reflecting investment needed for growth.

**5. SBC and Dilution:**
*   Stock-based compensation will be treated as a real cash expense. TTM SBC was 1.0% of revenue ($31.3M / $3,047.3M). We will hold SBC steady at **1.0% of revenue** annually.
*   The share count for the final per-share calculation will be **47.1 million shares**. (Form 10-K, February 28, 2025, p. F-5).

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** `FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | **2025E** | **2026E** | **2027E** | **2028E** | **2029E** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $3,093.0 | $3,185.8 | $3,281.4 | $3,379.8 | $3,481.2 |
| *Revenue Growth* | *1.5%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* | *3.0%* |
| EBIT (13.0% Margin) | $402.1 | $414.2 | $426.6 | $439.4 | $452.6 |
| NOPAT (EBIT * 0.82) | $329.7 | $339.6 | $349.8 | $360.3 | $371.1 |
| (+) D&A (9.0% of Rev) | $278.4 | $286.7 | $295.3 | $304.2 | $313.3 |
| (-) Capex (4.0% of Rev) | ($123.7) | ($127.4) | ($131.3) | ($135.2) | ($139.2) |
| (-) SBC (1.0% of Rev) | ($30.9) | ($31.9) | ($32.8) | ($33.8) | ($34.8) |
| (-) Î” in Working Capital | ($2.3) | ($4.6) | ($4.8) | ($4.9) | ($5.1) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **$451.2** | **$462.4** | **$476.2** | **$490.6** | **$505.3** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

**1. Cost of Equity (CAPM):** `Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium`
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.29% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 20, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. This is a standard, widely accepted premium for the U.S. market.
*   **Beta:** 1.08. This 5-year monthly beta reflects volatility similar to the market average, which is reasonable for a large, established medical device company. (StockAnalysis.com, August 21, 2025).
*   *Calculation:* `4.29% + 1.08 * 5.0% = 9.69%`

**2. Cost of Debt:**
*   `Interest Expense / Total Debt = $83.5M / $1,663.0M = 5.02%`
*   After-Tax Cost of Debt: `5.02% * (1 - 18.0%) = 4.12%`

**3. WACC:** `WACC = (E/V * Ke) + (D/V * Kd * (1-t))`
*   Market Cap (E): $5.56 Billion (Approximate, based on recent trading)
*   Net Debt (D): $1,372.8 Million ($1,663.0M Debt - $290.2M Cash)
*   Enterprise Value (V): E + D = $6.93 Billion
*   Weight of Equity (E/V): 80.2%
*   Weight of Debt (D/V): 19.8%
*   *Calculation:* `(80.2% * 9.69%) + (19.8% * 4.12%) = 7.77% + 0.82% = 8.59%`
*   **WACC Used:** 8.6%

### **F) Terminal Value**

**1. Gordon Growth Method:** `TV = FCFF_Yr5 * (1 + g) / (WACC - g)`
*   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5%. This is a conservative rate, in line with long-term inflation expectations and sustainable GDP growth.
*   *Calculation:* `$505.3M * (1 + 0.025) / (0.086 - 0.025) = $517.9M / 0.061 = $8,490.2 Million`

**2. Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
*   A historical median EV/EBITDA multiple for TFX is approximately 12.0x.
*   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = $452.6M + $313.3M = $765.9M
*   *Implied Terminal Value:* `$765.9M * 12.0 = $9,190.8 Million`
*   **Decision:** The Gordon Growth method yields a more conservative terminal value, so **$8,490.2 million** will be used in the final valuation.

---

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

**1. Enterprise Value:** `EV = PV of Explicit FCFF + PV of Terminal Value`
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   Year 1: $451.2 / (1.086)^1 = $415.5M
    *   Year 2: $462.4 / (1.086)^2 = $392.2M
    *   Year 3: $476.2 / (1.086)^3 = $371.4M
    *   Year 4: $490.6 / (1.086)^4 = $351.9M
    *   Year 5: $505.3 / (1.086)^5 = $334.3M
    *   **Total PV of FCFF = $1,865.3 Million**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** `$8,490.2 / (1.086)^5 = $5,620.2 Million`
*   **Enterprise Value (EV) = $1,865.3M + $5,620.2M = $7,485.5 Million**

**2. Equity Value:** `Equity Value = EV - Net Debt`
*   Net Debt: $1,372.8 Million (Total Debt of $1,663.0M minus Cash of $290.2M).
*   **Equity Value = $7,485.5M - $1,372.8M = $6,112.7 Million**

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

**1. Base-Case Fair Value:** `Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares`
*   *Calculation:* `$6,112.7 Million / 47.1 Million shares = $129.78`
*   **Base-Case Fair Value: $129.78 per share**

**2. Valuation Range:**
*   **Low/Bear Case ($95.20):** Assumes 0.5% revenue growth and a 12.0% EBIT margin, reflecting persistent competitive pressures and market headwinds.
*   **Base Case ($129.78):** As calculated above.
*   **High/Bull Case ($168.50):** Assumes 4.0% revenue growth and a 14.0% EBIT margin, reflecting successful new product launches and better-than-expected operational leverage.

**3. Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 25% discount to the base-case fair value is applied to account for forecast uncertainty and potential risks.
*   *Calculation:* `$129.78 * (1 - 0.25) = $97.34`
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price: $97.34**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Competitive Pressure:** The medical device industry is highly competitive. TFX faces pressure in key segments like Interventional Urology, which led to a recent goodwill impairment and could continue to impact growth and pricing power.
2.  **Regulatory and Reimbursement Risk:** Changes in healthcare regulations, particularly in the U.S. and Europe (EU MDR), can create significant compliance costs and delay product approvals. Furthermore, adverse changes in reimbursement policies from government and private payors could reduce demand for TFX's products.
3.  **Execution Risk on Strategic Initiatives:** The company recently announced its intention to separate its Urology, Acute Care, and OEM businesses. Such a complex transaction carries significant execution risk, potential for business disruption, and may not deliver the anticipated shareholder value.
4.  **Supply Chain and Input Cost Volatility:** Like many manufacturers, TFX is exposed to fluctuations in raw material costs (e.g., resins) and potential disruptions in its global supply chain, including sterilization services, which could impact margins and product availability.

final answer is 129.78 $
