Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 10-K, Q1 & Q2 2025 10-Q filings, and earnings call transcripts.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's marketplace faces intense competition and has seen Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) stagnate, with a 2% decrease in Q4 2024 and a 1% decrease in Q1 2025. While the company is focused on specific categories like motors, watches, and collectibles, and has a significant total addressable market (TAM), the overall growth trend is flat. The global e-commerce market is growing, but eBay's ability to capture a significant portion of this growth is not evident from recent results.

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's management is focused on "category-led growth" and is investing in technology to improve the user experience. The company has been actively updating its platform with features like the "eBay international shipping" program and the acquisition of Certilogo. These efforts demonstrate a commitment to developing the platform and services.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's Product Development expenses, which include R&D, were $410 million in Q1 2025, or 16.1% of revenue. This is a significant investment, but the effectiveness is questionable given the stagnant GMV and active buyer count. While the company is launching new features, they have yet to translate into meaningful top-line growth.
**Answer:** No

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's sales and marketing expenses were $529 million in Q1 2025, a significant portion of revenue. The company's sales are generated through its online platform, and its marketing efforts are focused on attracting and retaining buyers and sellers. However, with active buyers declining by 1% in Q1 2025, the effectiveness of the sales and marketing efforts is not above average.
**Answer:** No

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay has strong profit margins. In Q1 2025, the company reported a GAAP operating margin of 22.3% and a non-GAAP operating margin of 30.3%. These margins are healthy and demonstrate the company's ability to generate profits from its operations.
**Answer:** Yes

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on cost control and operational efficiency. The company has been undergoing a restructuring, which includes a 9% reduction in the workforce. Additionally, eBay is focused on growing its higher-margin advertising business. These actions indicate a clear strategy to maintain and improve profit margins.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence of major labor disputes or widespread employee dissatisfaction. However, the company has undertaken significant layoffs, announcing a 9% workforce reduction in January 2025. While layoffs are not indicative of poor labor relations on their own, they can impact morale and company culture.
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at eBay appears stable, with no recent high-profile departures. The CEO, Jamie Iannone, has been in his role since 2020. There are no public reports of significant discord or issues among the executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay has a well-defined management structure with experienced executives leading various business segments. The company's investor relations page lists a full slate of senior leaders. This suggests a good depth of management beyond the CEO.
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's financial reporting is detailed, with clear segment and cost breakdowns. The company's filings are audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, a reputable accounting firm. There are no indications of material weaknesses in internal controls or significant accounting issues.
**Answer:** Yes

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's key competitive advantage is its network effect, with a large base of buyers and sellers. The company is also a leader in the growing "recommerce" or second-hand market. However, the company is facing stiff competition from larger players like Amazon and specialized platforms, which are eroding its market share.
**Answer:** No

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary focuses on long-term, sustainable growth. The company is investing in technology and "category-led growth" initiatives, which may not have an immediate payoff. The willingness to undertake a restructuring to improve long-term efficiency also points to a long-range outlook.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay has a strong balance sheet and generates significant free cash flow. In Q1 2025, the company generated $616 million in free cash flow and repurchased $598 million of its own stock. With a cash and equivalents balance of $5.3 billion, the company is not at risk of needing to issue equity for funding.
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** eBay's management team regularly communicates with investors through earnings calls, conferences, and filings. They address challenges, such as the decline in GMV and active buyers, directly in their public statements. The level of disclosure appears to be adequate and transparent.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no recent, significant legal or ethical issues that would call into question the integrity of eBay's management team. The company has a code of conduct and appears to operate within legal and ethical boundaries.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**

eBay presents a mixed picture based on Fisher's 15 points. The company's strengths lie in its strong profit margins, solid financial position, and experienced management team. However, the core issue is the lack of top-line growth, with stagnant Gross Merchandise Volume and a declining active buyer base. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the success of the "category-led growth" strategy and the impact of technology investments on the user experience. To turn the "No" answers into "Yes," eBay would need to demonstrate a return to sustainable GMV and active buyer growth.

fisher score is 10 / 15
