The search results provide links to YUMC's investor relations and SEC filings pages. The dates in the search results and the user's provided URLs seem to be in the future (e.g., Q2 2025 results on Aug 5, 2025, but today is August 22, 2025). I will proceed by browsing the official investor relations page to find the *actual* most recently filed documents, which would be the 2024 annual report (10-K) and the Q1 and Q2 2025 quarterly reports (10-Q). The provided URLs appear to be speculative future links, so I will find the real ones. The search result links to an "Investor Overview" which is a good starting point. I will modify that URL to go directly to the SEC filings section, which is a common structure for investor relations websites. A common URL structure is `ir.yumchina.com/sec-filings`. I will try to browse that, and also the transcript link provided in the prompt.
The browse tool failed for the SEC filings URL I constructed, but it successfully accessed the transcripts page. The transcript page lists earnings calls up to "Q2 Aug 05" for FY 2025. This confirms that recent documents are available. I will now try browsing the specific URLs for the most relevant recent filings: the 2024 Annual Report (Form 20-F, which is equivalent to 10-K for foreign private issuers) and the Q1 and Q2 2025 reports (Form 6-K, which is used for current reports). I will locate these from the SEC's EDGAR database via search.I have successfully gathered the Q1 and Q2 2025 earnings releases. These documents provide the most up-to-date information on store count, membership, digital sales, and financial performance. I will now proceed with the analysis and scoring of each moat dimension based on this evidence. I have sufficient information to begin constructing the report.

### 1) Network Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Yum China's network effect is primarily driven by its loyalty programs, which have amassed a massive user base, creating a virtuous cycle where more members lead to more data, better promotions, and increased transaction frequency. While not a traditional network effect where users interact, the scale of the membership base enhances the value proposition for each member through personalized offers. The growth in membership and its high penetration in sales demonstrate a moderate but meaningful network effect.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "Total membership of KFC and Pizza Hut was approximately 560 million, up 13% versus the prior year." (Yum China Q2 2025 Results, August 5, 2025)
*   "Digital sales reached $2.4 billion, with digital ordering accounting for approximately 94% of total Company sales." (Yum China Q2 2025 Results, August 5, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 2) Switching Costs
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Switching costs for customers are exceptionally low, as is typical in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry. While the company's loyalty programs and digital apps create some behavioral stickiness, there are no contractual, technical, or financial barriers preventing a customer from choosing a competitor for their next meal. The primary lock-in is convenience and accumulated loyalty points, which represent a very weak form of switching cost.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   There is no evidence of contractual lock-in or significant customer migration costs in the company's public filings; the business model is transactional by nature. (Inference based on the absence of evidence in Q1 and Q2 2025 reports).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### 3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Yum China demonstrates a significant cost advantage through its massive scale, sophisticated supply chain, and increasing operational efficiency. The company's ability to drive down food and paper costs while expanding restaurant margins, even while offering greater value to customers, points to a durable per-unit cost advantage over smaller rivals. This is a direct result of proprietary logistics and immense purchasing power.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "Restaurant margin was 16.1%, an increase of 60 basis points YoY, driven primarily by savings in Food and Paper cost and Occupancy and Other Operating expenses." (Yum China Q2 2025 Results, August 5, 2025)
*   "Yum China has a world-class, digitalized supply chain which includes an extensive network of logistics centers nationwide and an in-house supply chain management system." (Yum China Q1 2025 Earnings Release, April 30, 2025)
*   "Restaurant margin was 18.6%, an increase of 100 basis points YoY, driven primarily by savings in Food and Paper cost and Occupancy and Other Operating expenses." (Yum China Q1 2025 Results, April 30, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The company operates two of the most powerful and recognized restaurant brands in China: KFC and Pizza Hut. These brands have been adapted to local tastes and enjoy decades of consumer trust and awareness that new entrants cannot easily replicate. While the core intellectual property is licensed from Yum! Brands, Yum China possesses the exclusive, perpetual right to operate and sub-license these brands in China, which is a powerful, long-term intangible asset.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "KFC and Pizza Hut are the leading brands in the quick-service and casual dining restaurant spaces in China, respectively." (Yum China Q1 2025 Earnings Release, April 30, 2025)
*   The company operates under a Master License Agreement with Yum! Brands, granting it exclusive rights in China. (Inference from the company's business description across all filings).
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 5) Distribution & Efficient Scale
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** With over 16,000 locations, Yum China has an unparalleled physical distribution network that makes it incredibly difficult for competitors to match its reach and convenience. This density creates efficient scale, allowing for cost-effective marketing, logistics, and delivery operations that improve unit economics. The aggressive and ongoing store expansion, particularly into lower-tier cities, further solidifies this advantage and deters new entrants by saturating the market.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "Total store count reached 16,642 as of March 31, 2025." (Yum China Q1 2025 Results, April 30, 2025)
*   "The Company targets approximately 1,600 to 1,800 net new stores... for the 2025 fiscal year." (Yum China Q1 2025 Results, April 30, 2025)
*   "Delivery contributed approximately 45% of total Company sales." (Yum China Q2 2025 Results, August 5, 2025) This delivery penetration is enabled by the dense store network.
**Score:** 5 / 5

### 6) Data Advantage
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The company's massive loyalty program, with over half a billion members, provides a vast and proprietary dataset on consumer preferences and behavior. This data feeds a powerful feedback loop, enabling personalized marketing, menu innovation, and improved operational efficiency. The scale of this dataset and the high frequency of transactions (with 94% of orders being digital) create a significant competitive advantage that is difficult for others to replicate.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "Total membership of KFC and Pizza Hut was approximately 560 million, up 13% versus the prior year." (Yum China Q2 2025 Results, August 5, 2025)
*   "Its strong digital capabilities and loyalty program enable the Company to reach customers faster and serve them better." (Yum China Q1 2025 Earnings Release, April 30, 2025)
*   "digital ordering accounting for approximately 94% of total Company sales." (Yum China Q2 2025 Results, August 5, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

### 7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Yum China is building a nascent ecosystem around its core restaurant business, primarily through its loyalty programs and delivery platform. However, it lacks significant third-party developer adoption or a complementary product marketplace that defines a strong platform effect. The "ecosystem" is largely a one-to-many relationship with customers rather than a many-to-many network, limiting this dimension's strength.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "Delivery sales grew 22% YoY." (Yum China Q2 2025 Results, August 5, 2025). This indicates a strong proprietary delivery network, but it is a first-party service, not a third-party platform.
*   The company has partnered with Lavazza to develop the coffee concept in China, but this is a partnership, not a broad, open ecosystem. (Yum China Q1 2025 Earnings Release, April 30, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** The restaurant industry in China is subject to significant food safety and operational regulations, which can be a barrier to smaller, less sophisticated operators. Yum China's scale allows it to invest heavily in compliance and maintain high standards, creating a moderate barrier. However, there are no exclusive licenses or government-granted monopolies that would prevent a well-capitalized competitor from entering the market.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "Our ability to maintain food safety and quality control systems" is listed as a key factor for success, implying a complex regulatory environment. (Yum China Q1 2025 Results Presentation, April 30, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

### 9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Building a nationwide network of over 16,000 restaurants requires immense capital investment and significant lead time, creating a substantial barrier to entry. The company's annual capital expenditures are significant, reflecting the ongoing investment needed to maintain and grow its physical footprint. These assets (restaurants and logistics centers) are specific to the QSR industry and cannot be easily repurposed, representing a high sunk cost for any potential competitor.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   "The Company targets... capital expenditures in the range of approximately $700 million to $800 million for the 2025 fiscal year." (Yum China Q1 2025 Results, April 30, 2025)
*   "Total store count reached 16,642 as of March 31, 2025." (Yum China Q1 2025 Results, April 30, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

### 10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility
**Reasoning (2–4 sentences):** Revenue is almost entirely transactional, with no long-term customer contracts. As a result, revenue visibility is very low and depends on daily consumer choices. This is inherent to the QSR business model and represents a negligible source of competitive advantage.
**Evidence (1–3 bullets):**
*   The business model described in all financial reports is based on sales at the restaurant level, with no mention of long-term recurring revenue contracts. (Inference based on the absence of evidence in Q1 and Q2 2025 reports).
**Score:** 1 / 5

### Aggregation
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (3 * 0.18) + (1 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (4 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.08) + (2 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (1 * 0.02) =
    0.54 + 0.15 + 0.60 + 0.48 + 0.50 + 0.40 + 0.16 + 0.12 + 0.12 + 0.02 = **61.9**
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 61.9 / 100

### Mapping
*   The weighted score of 61.9 falls within the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range.
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 3.

### Moat Duration Justification
The company's moat is primarily built on its immense distribution scale, strong brands, and cost advantages from its supply chain. These advantages are difficult and costly to replicate, suggesting a durable moat. The estimated duration of 8-12 years is based on the time it would take a competitor to build a comparable physical footprint and brand recognition. The key long-term risk is not a specific contract expiry but a gradual erosion from shifting consumer preferences or a highly aggressive, well-capitalized domestic competitor.

### Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios
1.  **Intensified Local Competition:** A domestic competitor could gain significant market share by offering more localized products at competitive prices, eroding YUMC's brand dominance and pricing power.
2.  **Food Safety Incident:** A major, well-publicized food safety issue at either KFC or Pizza Hut could cause severe and lasting damage to brand reputation, which is a cornerstone of its intangible asset moat.
3.  **Digital Disruption:** The rise of third-party delivery super-apps or new digital restaurant models could diminish the competitive advantage of YUMC's proprietary delivery network and loyalty program, commoditizing its customer relationships.

### KPIs to Monitor
1.  **Same-Store Sales Growth:** A sustained decline would indicate weakening brand relevance and pricing power.
2.  **Restaurant Margins:** Compression in margins would signal a loss of cost advantage or increased competitive pressure.
3.  **Net New Store Openings:** A slowdown in the pace of expansion could indicate market saturation or declining unit economics.
4.  **Loyalty Program Membership Growth:** Stagnation or decline would weaken the data advantage and network effect.
5.  **Delivery as % of Sales:** A decrease could suggest that third-party platforms are capturing market share.
6.  **Customer Traffic/Transaction Growth:** Declining transactions are a leading indicator of weakening customer preference.
7.  **Franchise Mix of New Stores:** Changes in this mix could signal shifts in capital strategy or franchisee confidence.

### Short Verdict Paragraph
Yum China possesses a solid economic moat, warranting a 3 out of 5 rating. Its primary advantages are its unparalleled distribution scale and the strong brand equity of KFC and Pizza Hut in the Chinese market. These are reinforced by significant cost advantages derived from a sophisticated supply chain and a powerful data advantage fed by a 560-million-member loyalty program. However, the moat is constrained by the inherent lack of customer switching costs in the QSR industry. A rating upgrade would require evidence of stronger platform effects or higher switching costs, while a downgrade could be triggered by sustained margin compression or a material loss of market share to agile local competitors.

moat rating is 3 / 5
