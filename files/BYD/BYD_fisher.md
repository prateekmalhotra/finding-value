Boyd Gaming Corporation, August 24, 2025, primary sources reviewed: Form 10-Q filed May 2, 2025.

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming's growth opportunities lie in its expansion into online gaming and the development of new properties. The Online segment's revenue increased by $23.4 million in Q1 2025, driven by both organic growth and acquisitions. Furthermore, the company is investing approximately $750 million in a new casino resort in Norfolk, Virginia, which is expected to open in late 2027. These initiatives suggest potential for future sales growth. However, the core business faces challenges, with softness in some regional markets.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively pursuing growth through both online and physical expansion. The company's strategic partnership with FanDuel provides a platform for growth in online sports betting. The development of the Norfolk, Virginia casino, a $750 million project, demonstrates a significant commitment to long-term growth. Additionally, Boyd is investing in renovations and expansions at existing properties, such as the meeting and convention space at Ameristar St. Charles and the new Cadence Crossing casino.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925014323/bgc20250331_10q.htm'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/906553/000143774925014323/bgc20250331_10q.htm) [May 2, 2025]

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd Gaming does not report traditional R&D expenses. However, its partnership with FanDuel for online gaming and sports betting can be viewed as a form of outsourced R&D. The growth in the Online segment, with a 52% year-over-year revenue increase, suggests this partnership is effective in capturing a share of the growing online gaming market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Boyd's "Boyd Rewards" loyalty program is a key component of its sales and marketing strategy.

The focus on the Hawaiian market for its Downtown Las Vegas properties demonstrates a targeted and effective marketing approach.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Boyd Gaming scores well on several of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth strategy, financial strength, and transparency with investors. The company's expansion into online gaming and its development of new properties are key positives. However, there are some areas where more information is needed, such as labor and executive relations. The biggest variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the performance of the online gaming segment, the progress of the Norfolk casino development, and the company's ability to maintain its profit margins in the face of economic headwinds. Evidence of strong execution in these areas would likely improve the company's score.

fisher score is 11 / 15
