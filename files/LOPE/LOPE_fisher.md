### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of March 31, 2025, GCE had a strong balance sheet with $308.6 million in cash and cash equivalents. The company generates significant free cash flow and has a share repurchase program in place, indicating it is more likely to return capital to shareholders than to seek additional equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1434588/000155837025006495/lope-20250331x10q.htm']

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?

While the company maintains it has done nothing wrong, the ongoing litigation creates a significant overhang.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1434588/000155837025001150/lope-20241231x10k.htm']

Synthesis: Grand Canyon Education demonstrates strength in its business model, profitability, and financial management. The company's long-term growth prospects appear solid, driven by the increasing demand for online higher education and its ability to effectively serve its university partners. However, the ongoing legal and regulatory challenges related to its primary partner, Grand Canyon University, represent a significant risk and are the primary factor preventing a higher score. A resolution of the dispute with the Department of Education in the company's favor would be the most significant catalyst for a score change in the next 12-24 months.

fisher score is 13 / 15
