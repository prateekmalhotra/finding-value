### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

**1) Current Market Price:**


*   **Market Price:** $22.97 (August 22, 2025, 4:00 PM)

**2) Baseline Financials (TTM as of June 30, 2025)**

| Metric | Amount (in millions USD) | Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $919.26 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Gross Margin | 12.98% | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | $84.38 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Net Income | $71.15 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Depreciation & Amortization (D&A) | $24.63 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) | $10.56 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Capital Expenditures (Capex) | ($8.85) | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($33.35) | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Interest Expense | ($7.41) | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Cash & Equivalents | $35.03 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $109.60 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |
| Diluted Weighted-Average Shares | 105.0 | (StockAnalysis, Aug 23, 2025) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To justify the market price of $22.97, which corresponds to an Enterprise Value of approximately $2,486.2 million (calculated as $22.97 * 105.0 million shares + $109.60 million debt - $35.03 million cash), the market must believe in a specific set of future performance metrics. Holding the TTM operating margin and other ratios constant, a reverse DCF model solves for the required growth.

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue Growth:** The model indicates that to reach the current enterprise value, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue CAGR of approximately 14.5%**.
*   **Market-Implied Operating Margin:** This assumes the operating margin remains stable at the TTM level of **9.2%**.

This combination of sustained high growth and stable profitability is what is required to justify the current market valuation. The question for an investor is whether this is a realistic and achievable scenario.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds a valuation based on independent assumptions grounded in historical performance, industry trends, and management commentary.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**6) Critical Review of Market Assumptions:** The market's implied 14.5% revenue growth is aggressive. While the original analyst's projection (10% tapering to 4%) was too conservative, this revised model assumes a more balanced trajectory that accounts for near-term industry tailwinds.

**7) Revenue for Years 1–5:**
*   **Assumption:** Revenue will grow at **12%** in Year 1, tapering down by 1.5% each year to **6%** in Year 5.
*   **Justification:** This growth rate is more realistic than the original's conservative taper. It reflects continued strong consumer demand for travel, new cruise ship deployments (a direct driver for OSW), and increased onboard spending. The taper still acknowledges the eventual maturation of the post-pandemic recovery cycle.

**8) Margin Path:**
*   **Assumption:** Operating margin will start at **9.5%** in Year 1 and expand by 25 basis points (0.25%) annually to reach **10.5%** by Year 5.
*   **Justification:** The assumption of a flat margin was a key flaw in the prior analysis. OSW has significant operating leverage. As revenues increase, particularly from higher-margin services and products, margin expansion is a realistic expectation. This gradual expansion reflects improved efficiency and economies of scale.

**9) Taxes:**
*   **Assumption:** An effective tax rate of **5.1%**.
*   **Justification:** This is the average of the TTM effective tax rate of 5.08% and the FY 2024 rate of 5.19%. This assumption is sound and remains unchanged.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Capex:** Assumed to be **1.0% of revenue**. This remains a reasonable and slightly conservative assumption.
*   **Working Capital:** Change in Working Capital is modeled at **4.0% of the change in revenue**, based on recent historical trends. This assumption is sound and remains unchanged.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   **SBC:** Treated as a real cash expense. Forecasted at **1.15% of revenue**, consistent with the TTM level.
*   **Share Count:** The diluted share count of 105.0 million is projected to **increase by 0.5% annually**. The previous assumption of a decreasing share count was optimistic. A slight increase is more realistic, accounting for dilution from stock-based compensation that may not be fully offset by buybacks.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**12) Free Cash Flow to Firm (FCFF) Calculation:**
FCFF is used because it represents cash flow available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.
*   **Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

**FCFF Forecast (in millions USD):**
| Year | 2026 (Y1) | 2027 (Y2) | 2028 (Y3) | 2029 (Y4) | 2030 (Y5) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue Growth | 12.0% | 10.5% | 9.0% | 7.5% | 6.0% |
| Revenue | $1,029.6 | $1,137.7 | $1,240.1 | $1,333.1 | $1,413.1 |
| EBIT Margin | 9.5% | 9.75% | 10.0% | 10.25% | 10.5% |
| EBIT | $97.8 | $111.0 | $124.0 | $136.6 | $148.4 |
| NOPAT | $92.8 | $105.3 | $117.7 | $129.7 | $140.8 |
| \+ D&A (2.7% of Rev) | $27.8 | $30.7 | $33.5 | $36.0 | $38.2 |
| \- SBC (1.15% of Rev) | ($11.8) | ($13.1) | ($14.3) | ($15.3) | ($16.2) |
| \- Capex (1.0% of Rev) | ($10.3) | ($11.4) | ($12.4) | ($13.3) | ($14.1) |
| \- Δ in WC (4% of ΔRev) | ($4.4) | ($4.3) | ($4.1) | ($3.7) | ($3.2) |
| **FCFF** | **$94.1** | **$107.2** | **$120.4** | **$133.4** | **$145.5** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**
**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.26% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 22, 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0%. A standard assumption for the U.S. market.
*   **Beta:** 1.38 (5-Year Monthly). This beta is above 1.0, reflecting OSW's stock has historically been more volatile than the broader market.
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.26% + 1.38 * 5.0% = 11.16%**

**15) Cost of Debt:**
*   **Calculation:** Interest Expense / Average Total Debt = $7.41M / (($109.60M + $170.63M)/2) = 5.28%
*   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 5.28% * (1 - 5.1%) = 5.01%**

**16) Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC):**
*   Market Value of Equity (Market Cap) = $2,411.9M ($22.97 * 105.0M shares)
*   Market Value of Debt = $109.6M
*   Total Value (V) = $2,521.5M
*   **WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1-t))**
*   **WACC = ($2,411.9/$2,521.5 * 11.16%) + ($109.6/$2,521.5 * 5.01%) = 10.90%**
*(Note: WACC calculation is sound and remains unchanged as inputs are based on current market data).*

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Exit Multiple Method:**
*   **Justification:** The Exit Multiple method is chosen over Gordon Growth as it better reflects how the market would likely value a mature but market-leading, capital-light business in the consumer services sector. The original GGM-derived multiple of 9.4x was too conservative.
*   **Year 5 EBITDA Calculation:** EBIT_Y5 + D&A_Y5 = $148.4M + $38.2M = **$186.6M**
*   **Exit Multiple:** **11.0x EV/EBITDA**. This is a realistic multiple for a stable, high-quality company in this industry, balancing growth prospects with maturity. It is higher than the previous implied multiple but not overly aggressive.
*   **Terminal Value = $186.6M * 11.0 = $2,052.6M**

**18) Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
*   a. **Implied Terminal Growth Rate (g):** Rearranging the GGM formula: g = WACC - (FCFF_Y5 / Terminal Value).
*   a. **g = 0.1090 - ($145.5M / $2,052.6M) = 0.1090 - 0.0709 = 3.81%**
*   b. **Conclusion:** This implied growth rate of 3.81% is plausible, albeit on the higher end of typical long-term growth rates. However, given the company's strong market position and potential for price increases, it serves as a reasonable sanity check for the 11.0x multiple. The **$2,052.6M** terminal value from the Exit Multiple method will be used.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value:**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($94.1 / 1.109^1) + ($107.2 / 1.109^2) + ($120.4 / 1.109^3) + ($133.4 / 1.109^4) + ($145.5 / 1.109^5) = $84.9M + $87.3M + $88.0M + $87.5M + $86.1M = **$433.8M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $2,052.6M / (1.109^5) = **$1,214.9M**
*   **Total Enterprise Value = $433.8M + $1,214.9M = $1,648.7M**

**20) Equity Value:**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
*   **Equity Value = $1,648.7M - ($109.60M Debt - $35.03M Cash) = $1,574.1M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   **Projected Year 5 Shares:** 105.0M * (1 + 0.005)^5 = 107.7M shares
*   **Fair Value Per Share = $1,574.1M / 107.7M shares = $14.62**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $14.62.** (As calculated)
*   **Low/Bear Case: $11.25.** (Assumes 8% initial growth tapering to 4%, 9.0% final EBIT margin, 10.0x exit multiple).
*   **High/Bull Case: $18.50.** (Assumes 14% initial growth tapering to 7%, 11.5% final EBIT margin, 12.0x exit multiple).

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 30% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate.
*   **MOS Price = $14.62 * (1 - 0.30) = $10.23**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Cruise Industry Dependence:** OSW's revenue is overwhelmingly tied to the health of the cruise industry. Economic downturns, geopolitical events, or health crises that affect cruise travel will directly and significantly impact OSW's financial results.
2.  **Customer Concentration:** A small number of cruise line partners account for a large percentage of revenue. The loss or renegotiation of a key contract would materially harm the business.
3.  **Labor and Supply Chain:** As a service-intensive business, OSW is vulnerable to labor shortages, wage inflation, and supply chain disruptions for its premium wellness products, which could compress margins.

final answer is 14.62 $
