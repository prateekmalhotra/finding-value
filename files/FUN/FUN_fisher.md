Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, August 20, 2025, primary sources reviewed: SEC filings, earnings call transcripts, and investor presentations.

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The North American theme park market is mature, with modest low-single-digit annual growth expectations. Six Flags' sales growth is primarily driven by attendance and in-park spending, which are cyclical and sensitive to economic conditions. While the company is expanding its water park and lodging offerings, and has entered into a merger with Cedar Fair to expand its footprint, these initiatives are unlikely to produce a "sizable" increase in sales for several years, as stated in Fisher's question. The company's 2024 10-K notes that their business is "mature" and that they "compete with all other forms of entertainment".
**Answer:** No

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Six Flags consistently invests in new rides, attractions, and in-park services to drive attendance and enhance the guest experience. The company's capital expenditures were $124 million in 2024, and are projected to be between $170 to $190 million in 2025. These investments are crucial for attracting new and repeat visitors. The company's investor presentations also highlight a pipeline of new attractions and a focus on improving guest-facing technology.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the theme park industry, "R&D" is best measured by the return on invested capital for new attractions. Six Flags does not disclose specific ROI figures for its capital projects. The company's capital spending as a percentage of revenue is broadly in line with industry peers. However, without specific data on the attendance and revenue uplift from new investments, it's difficult to definitively assess their effectiveness.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Six Flags has a sophisticated sales and marketing function that leverages a season pass program, group sales, and dynamic pricing to drive attendance. The company has been focused on increasing attendance and has seen some success, with attendance up 3% in the second quarter of 2025. The company's sales and marketing expenses were 9% of revenue in 2024, a significant investment in driving top-line growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000154/fun-20250629.htm']

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, Six Flags reported a net income margin of 7.8% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 32%. While these margins are respectable, they are below those of its closest competitor, Cedar Fair, which consistently posts higher margins. The company's margins have also been volatile in recent years, impacted by the pandemic and subsequent changes in attendance and spending patterns.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on improving margins through a combination of pricing strategies, cost controls, and operational efficiencies. In their Q2 2025 earnings call, the company highlighted initiatives to optimize labor, reduce operating expenses, and enhance in-park spending through new food and beverage offerings and retail strategies. The company is also focused on leveraging technology to improve efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Six Flags employs a large seasonal workforce, and like many companies in the leisure and hospitality sector, it faces challenges with employee turnover and wage pressures. The company's 2024 10-K notes that "a significant portion of our employees are seasonal and are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage". While there are no reports of major labor disputes, the company does not disclose employee satisfaction or turnover metrics, making it difficult to assess the quality of its labor relations.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has experienced significant management turnover in recent years, including a new CEO in 2021. The pending merger with Cedar Fair will also result in a new leadership team, with the current Cedar Fair CEO taking the helm of the combined company. This level of change suggests a lack of stability in the executive ranks.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's investor relations website and SEC filings list a number of experienced executives in key operational roles. However, the pending merger with Cedar Fair creates uncertainty about the future leadership of the combined company. The merger is expected to close in the first half of 2025.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** []

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Six Flags' financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, and the company provides detailed segment-level financial data. The company's 2024 10-K states that "management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective". There have been no recent restatements or material weaknesses in internal controls reported.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive factor in the theme park industry is intellectual property. Six Flags has licensing agreements with Warner Bros. and DC Comics, which allow it to use iconic characters in its parks. This provides a key differentiator from many regional competitors. The company's geographic diversification across North America also provides a competitive advantage.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management's commentary in earnings calls and investor presentations suggests a focus on long-term value creation. The company is making significant investments in new rides and attractions, as well as technology, which are designed to drive long-term growth. The merger with Cedar Fair is also a long-term strategic move designed to create a more diversified and profitable company.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** []

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 29, 2025, Six Flags had $1.6 billion in debt and $65 million in cash. The company's debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 3.9x. While the company has access to a revolving credit facility, its high leverage and limited cash position could make it difficult to fund major growth initiatives without resorting to equity financing. The pending merger with Cedar Fair is an all-stock transaction, which will result in significant dilution to existing Six Flags shareholders.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000154/fun-20250629.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well and when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company's recent earnings call transcripts indicates that management is generally forthcoming with investors, providing detailed updates on financial performance and strategic initiatives. The company also provides detailed financial guidance and KPIs. Management has been open about the challenges the company has faced in recent years, including the impact of the pandemic and the subsequent recovery.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://discountingcashflows.com/company/FUN/transcripts/']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no legal or regulatory actions, related-party transactions, or other governance red flags that would call into question the integrity of the company's management. The company has a code of conduct and ethics that all employees are expected to follow. The company's 2024 10-K notes that "we are not a party to any material legal proceedings".
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1999001/000199900125000052/fun-20241231.htm']

**Synthesis**
Six Flags Entertainment Corporation exhibits some strengths, including its commitment to ongoing development of its parks, its sophisticated sales and marketing efforts, and its use of valuable intellectual property. The company is also taking steps to improve its profit margins and is generally transparent with investors. However, the company faces significant challenges, including operating in a mature and competitive market, relatively low profit margins, a history of management instability, and a highly leveraged balance sheet. The pending merger with Cedar Fair is a transformative event that could address some of these weaknesses, but it also introduces significant integration risk and will result in dilution to existing shareholders. The key variables that are most likely to change the company's score in the next 12-24 months are the successful integration of the Cedar Fair merger, the performance of the combined company's new leadership team, and a significant improvement in the company's profit margins and return on invested capital. To turn the "No" answers to "Yes," the company would need to demonstrate a sustained period of above-average revenue and earnings growth, improve its profit margins to be in line with its best-in-class peers, and reduce its debt to a more manageable level.
