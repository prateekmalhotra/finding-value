Company: Full House Resorts, Inc. (FLL)
Date of Analysis: August 24, 2025
Primary Sources Reviewed: 2024 Form 10-K, Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript

### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, the company has two major growth projects. The first is American Place, the only full-service casino in Lake County, Illinois, an affluent area with approximately 709,000 residents. A temporary facility opened in February 2023, and a much larger, permanent resort is planned for 2027. The second is the new Chamonix casino hotel in Cripple Creek, Colorado, which is significantly larger and of higher quality than any competitor in that market and is designed to grow the market. These projects provide a clear path for substantial sales growth over the next several years.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. December 31, 2024 10-K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891482/000089148225000009/fll-20241231x10k.htm)

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has committed significant capital and corporate focus to the development of its new flagship properties. The company took on approximately $450 million in debt to finance the construction of the Chamonix resort and the temporary and permanent American Place casinos. These multi-year projects demonstrate a clear strategy of reinvesting in new, large-scale developments to drive future growth beyond its existing portfolio of smaller, regional properties.
**Answer:** Yes

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** For a casino operator, "R&D" is best measured by the effectiveness of developing new properties. While Full House Resorts, a small company, successfully secured the attractive Waukegan, Illinois license and has built two major new facilities, the ultimate financial effectiveness and return on investment of these projects are not yet proven. The properties are still in their initial ramp-up phase, and there is insufficient evidence to determine if the development process was notably effective or superior relative to its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** N/A

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K describes standard industry marketing practices, including property-specific loyalty programs, direct mail, and digital advertising. It is noted that the loyalty programs are not integrated across the company's disparate locations, which suggests a functional, but not a superior or synergistic, national sales effort. There is no evidence of proprietary marketing techniques or above-average sales productivity that would distinguish it from competitors.
**Answer:** No

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Due to heavy investment in its new growth projects, the company's profitability is currently depressed. For the full year 2024, Full House Resorts reported an operating margin of approximately 0.9% and a net loss of $40.7 million. While its 2024 Adjusted EBITDA margin was 16.7%, the GAAP margins are not currently worthwhile as interest and depreciation from the new projects are consuming all profits.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. December 31, 2024 10-K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891482/000089148225000009/fll-20241231x10k.htm)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is taking explicit steps to improve margins. At the new Chamonix property, they are reducing expenses through constraints on overtime and improving supply contracts. At the Silver Slipper, they have "reined in some over-comping levels" to target more profitable revenue. Furthermore, as the new American Place casino increases revenue, it is showing strong operating leverage, with adjusted EBITDA growing faster than sales, indicating margin expansion.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K states, "We believe that our relationship with our employees is excellent. None of our employees are currently represented by labor unions." A review of public news sources reveals no reports of labor disputes, strikes, or unionization efforts at any of the company's properties. This lack of negative indicators supports management's assertion.
**Answer:** Yes

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The core executive team has a long and stable tenure. CEO Daniel R. Lee has led the company since late 2014, and President/CFO Lewis A. Fanger has been with the company since 2009. This leadership stability through a period of transformative growth projects suggests a cohesive and effective executive team.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. December 31, 2024 10-K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891482/000089148225000009/fll-20241231x10k.htm)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company lists four executive officers in its 10-K. While the top team is experienced, the company's public disclosures do not provide significant detail on the next layer of management or any formal succession plans. This creates a potential key-person risk around the long-tenured CEO and CFO, suggesting a lack of management depth.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. December 31, 2024 10-K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891482/000089148225000009/fll-20241231x10k.htm)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the company's internal control over financial reporting for the year ended December 31, 2024. The audit found that the company maintained effective internal controls in all material respects. There is no history of material weaknesses or financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. December 31, 2024 10-K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891482/000089148225000009/fll-20241231x10k.htm)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Full House Resorts' key strategy is to develop and operate casino properties in markets with limited competition and high barriers to entry. American Place is the only casino in its county, strategically located to serve the affluent northern Chicago suburbs. Chamonix was built to be the premier luxury destination in its market, with the goal of expanding the market rather than just taking share. This focus on securing advantaged or monopoly-like positions is a strong clue to its competitive strategy.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's recent strategy is a clear example of prioritizing long-range profits. Management has taken on significant debt (over $450 million) and accepted near-term net losses to fund the construction of Chamonix and American Place. This demonstrates a willingness to forgo current earnings for the opportunity to build assets that are expected to generate substantial, durable cash flow in the future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. December 31, 2024 10-K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891482/000089148225000009/fll-20241231x10k.htm)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K explicitly states that for its next major project, the permanent American Place facility, "we will likely need additional financing." Given its already high debt load, the company's ability to secure additional debt on favorable terms is not guaranteed. Should the company need to raise capital when bond markets are difficult or its leverage is deemed too high, it may be forced to issue equity, which would likely be highly dilutive to existing shareholders.
**Answer:** No

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In its Q2 2025 earnings call, management openly discussed negative results at several properties. They explained that revenue at Silver Slipper was down due to a deliberate reduction in promotions and a parking garage issue, and that the Tahoe property was facing challenges from renovations. This balanced presentation of both positive and negative news, with clear explanations for the challenges, demonstrates a high degree of candor.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the company’s SEC filings reveals no material legal proceedings that would call management's integrity into question. Furthermore, a search of public news records and the company's code of conduct policy reveals no history of regulatory scandals, governance concerns, or related-party transactions that would indicate a lack of integrity.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** FULL HOUSE RESORTS, INC. December 31, 2024 10-K (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/891482/000089148225000009/fll-20241231x10k.htm)

**Synthesis**

Full House Resorts scores well on Fisher's points related to long-term vision, strategic positioning, and management integrity. The company's strongest positive attributes are its clear runway for growth driven by new, well-positioned casino assets and a management team that has demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice short-term profits for long-term value creation. However, this strategy creates significant near-term risks, reflected in the "No" answers. The company currently has poor profit margins and faces a high risk of shareholder dilution, as it will need to secure a large financing package to build its permanent flagship casino in Illinois. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on two key variables: the financial performance of the recently opened Chamonix and temporary American Place casinos, and management's ability to secure financing for the permanent American Place. A "No" on profit margins would flip to "Yes" with several quarters of strong, profitable ramp-up at these new properties. A "No" on dilution risk would flip to "Yes" upon the successful closing of a primarily debt-based financing package for the permanent facility.

**Fisher Score is 10 / 15**
