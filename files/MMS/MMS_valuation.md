**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the assumptions priced into the stock, a Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is used to solve for the 5-year revenue growth rate that equates the model's output to the current market price of $87.00.

*   **WACC (preliminary):** A preliminary Weighted Average Cost of Capital of 7.73% is used for this analysis. (Detailed calculation in Part 2).
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%, a reasonable long-term inflation expectation.
*   **Operating Margin:** Held constant at the TTM level of 10.3% ($559.4M / $5,428.7M).
*   **Other Assumptions:** D&A, Capex, SBC, and Change in Working Capital are assumed to grow in line with revenue.

**Market-Implied Assumptions:**
Based on the reverse DCF, to justify the market price of **$87.00 per share**, the market is pricing in a **5-year revenue Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of approximately 7.0%** while assuming operating margins remain stable at the current TTM level of 10.3%.

### **PART 2: ANALYST'S REVISED VALUATION (REALISTIC BASE-CASE)**

This section identifies and corrects issues in the original valuation, formulating a more realistic base-case scenario.

**Key Issues Identified in Original Analysis:**
1.  **Overly Conservative Growth:** The original 5% tapering to 3% growth rate was too pessimistic given the strong Federal segment performance and historical 7.5% CAGR.
2.  **Margin Assumption:** Holding margins flat at 10.0% (below the TTM 10.3%) ignored potential operating leverage from growth and strong guidance in the Federal segment.
3.  **Terminal Value Method:** While the Gordon Growth method yielded a reasonable implied multiple, using a direct Exit Multiple based on historical averages is a more market-oriented and realistic approach for this type of company.
4.  **Incorrect Share Count in Final Calculation:** The original valuation incorrectly divided the present equity value by a future, reduced share count. The correct method is to use the current diluted share count, as future buybacks are implicitly accounted for in the Free Cash Flow projections.

**C) FORMULATE REALISTIC ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

**7) Revenue for Years 1–5:**
*   **Rationale:** The 3-year revenue CAGR (FY2021-FY2024) is 7.5%, and the market implies 7.0% growth. The Federal segment continues to show double-digit growth, acting as a strong engine. While the U.S. Services segment is normalizing, it provides a stable base. A growth rate between the original's conservative view and the market's optimistic view is more appropriate.
*   **Assumption:** A **6.0% revenue growth rate for years 1-2**, tapering to **5.0% in year 3**, and **4.0% in years 4-5**. This better reflects the strong momentum in key business segments while acknowledging the maturation of the overall business.

**8) Margin Path:**
*   **Rationale:** The TTM operating margin is 10.3%. Management has guided for strong margins in the growing Federal segment (15%). As higher-margin business becomes a larger part of the revenue mix and the company gains scale, modest operating leverage is a realistic expectation.
*   **Assumption:** Operating margin gradually expands from **10.4% in Year 1 to 10.8% in Year 5**, reflecting improved business mix and operational efficiency.

**9) Taxes:**
*   **Rationale:** Management guided a fiscal 2025 effective tax rate between 28.0% and 29.0%. The effective tax rate for FY2024 was 24.5%. A normalized rate balances these figures.
*   **Assumption:** A tax rate of **26.0%** is used, consistent with the original analysis.

**10) Capital Intensity:**
*   **Rationale:** Capex has historically been stable relative to revenue. The assumption for normalized Change in Working Capital remains appropriate.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   **Capex:** **2.0% of Revenue** annually.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** **4.0% of the change in Revenue** annually.

**11) SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
*   **Rationale:** Stock-Based Compensation is a real expense. While the company is actively buying back shares, this cash outflow is captured in the FCFF available to all capital providers. To avoid double-counting, the final per-share value will be calculated using the current diluted share count.
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   **SBC:** Treated as a real cash cost and subtracted from FCFF. Assumed to be **0.7% of Revenue**.
    *   **Share Count:** The TTM diluted share count of **58.9 million** is used for the final per-share value calculation.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $5,754.4 | $6,100.0 | $6,405.0 | $6,661.2 | $6,927.6 |
| EBIT | $598.5 | $640.5 | $678.9 | $712.7 | $748.2 |
| *Operating Margin* | *10.4%* | *10.5%* | *10.6%* | *10.7%* | *10.8%* |
| NOPAT | $442.9 | $474.0 | $502.4 | $527.4 | $553.7 |
| D&A | $120.3 | $127.6 | $134.0 | $140.4 | $146.9 |
| SBC | ($40.3) | ($42.7) | ($44.8) | ($46.6) | ($48.5) |
| Capex | ($115.1) | ($122.0) | ($128.1) | ($133.2) | ($138.6) |
| Change in WC | ($13.0) | ($13.8) | ($12.2) | ($10.3) | ($10.7) |
| **FCFF** | **$394.8** | **$423.1** | **$451.3** | **$477.7** | **$502.8** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

**14) Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
*   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury yield, August 2025).
*   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** 5.0% (Standard assumption for a mature market).
*   **Beta:** 0.95 (Reflects Maximus's moderate cyclicality).
*   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 0.95 * 5.0% = 9.00%**

**15) Cost of Debt:**
*   **Calculation:** TTM Interest Expense / Total Debt = $81.7M / $1,657.2M = 4.93%.
*   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.93% * (1 - 26.0%) = 3.65%**

**16) WACC Calculation:**
*   **Market Cap:** $87.00/share * 58.9M shares = $5,124.3M.
*   **Total Enterprise Value:** $5,124.3M + $1,657.2M - $59.8M = $6,721.7M.
*   **Equity Weight:** $5,124.3M / $6,721.7M = 76.2%
*   **Debt Weight:** $1,657.2M / $6,721.7M = 23.8%
*   **WACC = (76.2% * 9.00%) + (23.8% * 3.65%) = 6.86% + 0.87% = 7.73%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

**17) Exit Multiple Method:**
*   **Rationale:** An EV/EBITDA exit multiple is a common and realistic method for valuing mature service companies, directly reflecting market sentiment for similar assets. The company's historical multiple has averaged 10x-12x. An 11.0x multiple represents a fair, mid-range valuation.
*   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT ($748.2M) + D&A ($146.9M) = $895.1M.
*   **Terminal Value = Year 5 EBITDA * Exit Multiple = $895.1M * 11.0x = $9,846.1M**

**18) Gordon Growth Cross-Check:**
*   **Implied Terminal Growth Rate (g):** g = WACC - (Terminal FCFF / Terminal Value)
*   **Terminal FCFF (Year 6):** $502.8M * (1 + g)
*   Solving for 'g' using the Terminal Value of $9,846.1M implies a perpetual growth rate of **approximately 2.51%**.
*   **Conclusion:** This implied growth rate is highly reasonable and aligns with long-term economic growth expectations. This validates the 11.0x exit multiple as a sound assumption.

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

**19) Enterprise Value:**
*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** ($394.8/1.0773¹) + ($423.1/1.0773²) + ($451.3/1.0773³) + ($477.7/1.0773⁴) + ($502.8/1.0773⁵) = $366.5 + $364.7 + $362.4 + $356.6 + $346.0 = **$1,796.2M**.
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $9,846.1M / (1.0773⁵) = **$6,777.6M**.
*   **Enterprise Value = $1,796.2M + $6,777.6M = $8,573.8M**

**20) Equity Value:**
*   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
*   **Equity Value = $8,573.8M - ($1,657.2M Debt - $59.8M Cash) = $6,976.4M** (Net Debt source: Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025, p. 7)

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

**21) Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
*   **Diluted Shares Outstanding:** 58.9M (TTM weighted-average shares)
*   **Base-Case Fair Value = $6,976.4M / 58.9M shares = $118.44**

**22) Valuation Range:**
*   **Base Case: $118.44**. Assumes 6% revenue growth tapering to 4%, with margins expanding to 10.8%.
*   **Low/Bear Case: $95.00**. Assumes lower revenue growth (4% tapering to 2%) and margin compression to 9.5%.
*   **High/Bull Case: $142.00**. Assumes higher revenue growth (8% tapering to 5%) and margin expansion to 11.5%.

**23) Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
*   A 25% margin of safety is applied to the base-case estimate.
*   **MOS Price = $118.44 * (1 - 0.25) = $88.83**

**Risk Notes**
1.  **Government Contract Dependency:** A significant portion of revenue relies on a few large government contracts. The early recompete of the CCO contract and the required rebid of the VA MDE contracts represent significant risks if not retained. (Form 10-K, Sep 30, 2024, p. 34).
2.  **Political and Budgetary Risk:** Changes in government spending priorities, budget deficits, or legislative shifts could reduce funding for programs Maximus operates, impacting revenue and growth.
3.  **Execution Risk & Margin Pressure:** The business is labor-intensive, and failure to manage costs, especially in an inflationary environment, could compress margins on fixed-price and performance-based contracts.
4.  **Cybersecurity Risks:** As a handler of sensitive personal and health information, the company is a target for cyberattacks. A significant breach, like the previously disclosed MOVEit incident, could result in substantial legal, financial, and reputational damage. (Form 10-K, Sep 30, 2024, p. 16).
5.  **Working Capital Volatility:** The company's cash flows can be significantly impacted by administrative delays in payments from government clients, as seen in fiscal year 2025, increasing borrowing needs and interest expense. (Form 10-Q, June 30, 2025, p. 29).

final answer is 118.44 $
