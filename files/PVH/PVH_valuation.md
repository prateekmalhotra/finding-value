### B) Management Guidance Extraction

The most recent guidance was provided in the Q1 2025 earnings report (June 2025):
*   **Full Year Revenue:** "Reaffirms outlook of flat to increase slightly (flat to increase slightly on a constant currency basis)."
*   **Full Year Operating Margin:** "Projected to be approximately 8.5% on a non-GAAP basis."
*   **Full Year EPS (Non-GAAP):** "Projected to be in a range of $10.75 to $11.00 on a non-GAAP basis."

### C) Forecast & Assumptions (5 Years)

| Assumption | Value / Rationale | Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Year 1)** | **0.5%** | Based on the midpoint of management's "flat to increase slightly" guidance for 2025. |
| **Revenue Growth (Years 2-5)** | **2.0%** | A conservative rate reflecting maturity, industry competition, and long-term inflation expectations. This is below the historical 3-year CAGR to reflect a more challenging macroeconomic environment. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | **8.5% (Stable)** | Directly using management's non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the forecast period. Kept stable as no specific, quantifiable initiatives for further expansion were detailed. |
| **Tax Rate** | **22.0%** | Based on management's expectation for the 2025 effective tax rate, absent one-time charges. |
| **D&A as % of Revenue** | **3.2%** | Based on the TTM D&A of $277.8M as a percentage of TTM Revenue of $8,685M. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | **0.64%** | Based on the TTM Stock-Based Compensation of $55.6M as a percentage of TTM Revenue of $8,685M. |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | **1.7%** | Based on TTM Capex of $146.6M as a percentage of TTM Revenue of $8,685M, in line with historical averages. |
| **Change in NWC as % of Incr. Revenue** | **25.0%** | Based on historical relationship between changes in non-cash working capital and changes in revenue, implying investment is needed for growth. |

### D) Free Cash Flow Construction

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash flow available to all capital providers.
**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in NWC

| (USD, Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Revenue | $8,728 | $8,903 | $9,081 | $9,263 | $9,448 |
| EBIT (8.5% Margin) | $742 | $757 | $772 | $787 | $803 |
| Tax on EBIT (22%) | ($163) | ($166) | ($170) | ($173) | ($177) |
| **NOPAT** | **$579** | **$590** | **$602** | **$614** | **$626** |
| (+) D&A | $279 | $285 | $291 | $296 | $302 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp | ($56) | ($57) | ($58) | ($59) | ($60) |
| (-) Capex | ($148) | ($151) | ($154) | ($157) | ($161) |
| (-) Change in NWC | ($11) | ($44) | ($44) | ($45) | ($46) |
| **FCFF** | **$643** | **$624** | **$636** | **$649** | **$661** |

### E) Discount Rate (WACC)

| Component | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cost of Equity (CAPM)** | | |
| Risk-Free Rate | 4.25% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield. (CNBC, August 21, 2025) |
| Equity Risk Premium | 5.0% | Standard assumption for a mature market like the U.S. |
| Beta (5Y Monthly) | 1.45 | Sourced from public financial data providers; reflects higher volatility than the market average, which is consistent for the apparel industry. |
| **Cost of Equity** | **11.50%** | Formula: 4.25% + 1.45 * 5.0% |
| | | |
| **Cost of Debt** | | |
| Interest Expense (TTM) | $88.9M | (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025) |
| Total Debt | $2,347.3M | (SEC Form 10-Q, May 4, 2025) |
| Pre-Tax Cost of Debt | 3.79% | Formula: Interest Expense / Total Debt |
| Tax Rate | 22.0% | From assumptions |
| **After-Tax Cost of Debt** | **2.96%** | Formula: 3.79% * (1 - 22.0%) |
| | | |
| **WACC Calculation** | | |
| Market Cap (E) | $4,125M | (Calculation: 75.00 share price * 55.0M shares) |
| Market Value of Debt (D) | $2,347M | Book value used as a proxy. |
| Total Capital (E+D) | $6,472M | |
| Weight of Equity (E/V) | 63.7% | |
| Weight of Debt (D/V) | 36.3% | |
| **WACC** | **8.40%** | Formula: (63.7% * 11.50%) + (36.3% * 2.96%) |

### F) Terminal Value

| Method | Inputs | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Gordon Growth Model** | | |
| Year 5 FCFF | $661M | (From FCFF Table) |
| Terminal Growth Rate (g) | 2.5% | Assumed to be in line with long-term inflation and GDP growth. |
| WACC | 8.40% | (From WACC Calculation) |
| Terminal Value | **$11,460M** | Formula: ($661 * (1 + 2.5%)) / (8.40% - 2.5%) |
| | | |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check** | | |
| Year 5 EBITDA | $1,105M | (Calculation: $803M EBIT + $302M D&A) |
| Exit Multiple (EV/EBITDA) | 8.0x | A conservative multiple based on historical sector averages, reflecting industry maturity. |
| Terminal Value | **$8,840M** | Formula: $1,105M * 8.0 |

**Conclusion:** The Exit Multiple method yields a more conservative and lower Terminal Value. This value will be used in the final calculation.

### G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge

| Calculation Step | Value (Millions USD) |
| :--- | ---: |
| PV of Explicit FCFF | $2,583 |
| PV of Terminal Value ($8,840M discounted 5 years at 8.40%) | $5,907 |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$8,490** |
| (-) Total Debt | ($2,347) |
| (+) Cash & Equivalents | $191 |
| **Equity Value** | **$6,334** |

### H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Rationale for Deviation from Base Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base Case Fair Value** | **$115.16** | **(Calculation: $6,334M / 55.0M shares)** |
| **Low/Bear Case** | **$85 - $95** | Assumes lower revenue growth (0% to 1%) and margin compression (7.5% EBIT), with a lower exit multiple (7.0x). |
| **High/Bull Case** | **$135 - $145** | Assumes higher revenue growth (3% to 4%) and modest margin expansion (9.0% EBIT), with a higher exit multiple (9.0x). |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)**| **$80.61** | **(Calculation: $115.16 * (1 - 0.30))** |

### One-Paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include macroeconomic headwinds, particularly in North America and Europe, which could suppress consumer discretionary spending and lead to lower-than-forecasted revenue growth. The company's performance is heavily reliant on the brand strength of *Calvin Klein* and *TOMMY HILFIGER*; any damage to brand perception could materially impact sales. Intense competition in the global apparel industry could lead to margin pressure from promotional activity. Furthermore, supply chain disruptions and input cost volatility, along with foreign exchange rate fluctuations, remain significant risks to profitability.
