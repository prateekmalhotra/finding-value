**1) Network Effects**
-   **Reasoning:** CAAP's business as an airport operator does not benefit from traditional network effects. While more passengers and airlines attract more retail and service concessions, this is an indirect effect of scale, not a direct network effect where the value of the service increases for existing users as more users join. The value for a passenger at a specific airport is not materially enhanced by passenger growth in another country.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   The company operates 53 airports in 6 countries, serving 81.1 million passengers in 2023. This is a collection of local monopolies rather than an interconnected network. (Corporación América Airports, Aug 20, 2025)
-   **Score:** 1 / 5

**2) Switching Costs**
-   **Reasoning:** Airlines have a moderate degree of switching costs as they invest in routes and ground infrastructure at specific airports, but these are not insurmountable. Passengers have very low switching costs. The primary lock-in is the airport's geographic monopoly, not high switching costs for its users (airlines and passengers).
-   **Evidence:**
    -   The business model is based on concessions for specific locations, implying that the lock-in is geographical, not based on preventing customers from choosing alternatives if they were available.
-   **Score:** 2 / 5

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
-   **Reasoning:** As a scaled operator of 53 airports, CAAP likely benefits from economies of scale in procurement, shared services, and operational expertise compared to a smaller, single-airport operator. This is demonstrated by expanding EBITDA margins.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   Adjusted EBITDA margin ex-IFRIC12 expanded 1.4 percentage points to 38.6% in Q2 2025, suggesting strong operational efficiency and cost control. (Q2 2025 Earnings Release, Aug 20, 2025)
    -   Revenues grew nearly 19% in Q2 2025, outpacing passenger growth of 13.7%, indicating operating leverage and effective management. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Aug 21, 2025)
-   **Score:** 3 / 5

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
-   **Reasoning:** CAAP's primary intangible assets are its concession agreements. The company's brand is not a significant driver of traffic, as passengers and airlines choose airports based on geography and destination, not the operator's brand.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   The company's value is derived from its portfolio of long-term airport concessions, which are its most critical intangible assets. (Form 20-F, Mar 27, 2025)
-   **Score:** 2 / 5

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
-   **Reasoning:** CAAP's network of airports in key locations creates efficient scale. The high cost and regulatory hurdles of building new airports make it nearly impossible for new competitors to enter CAAP's markets. This creates a series of local monopolies. In Argentina, CAAP operates 37 of the 56 airports in the national system, a dominant position.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   CAAP is one of the leading private airport operators in the world, operating 53 airports in 6 countries. (Corporación América Airports, Aug 20, 2025)
    -   In its largest market, Argentina, the company operates and manages 37 of the 56 airports in the national airport system. (Corporación América Airports, Aug 20, 2025)
-   **Score:** 4 / 5

**6) Data Advantage**
-   **Reasoning:** While CAAP collects vast amounts of data on passenger traffic and commercial activity, there is limited evidence that this data provides a significant competitive advantage by creating a feedback loop that improves the service and locks in users. The data is likely used for operational optimization, but it's not a core driver of the moat.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   No specific data advantages are highlighted in the company's public disclosures. The focus is on passenger traffic and revenue per passenger as key metrics. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Aug 21, 2025)
-   **Score:** 1 / 5

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
-   **Reasoning:** CAAP's airports do not function as a platform or ecosystem in the technological sense. While they host a variety of third-party businesses (retail, food, services), there is no evidence of a developer ecosystem or platform that creates compounding value and lock-in.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   Commercial revenues are driven by cargo, parking, VIP lounges, and duty-free stores, which are traditional airport services, not platform-based offerings. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript, Aug 21, 2025)
-   **Score:** 1 / 5

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
-   **Reasoning:** This is the cornerstone of CAAP's moat. The company operates under long-term concession agreements with governments, which grant it the exclusive right to operate specific airports. These licenses are extremely difficult to obtain and represent a formidable barrier to entry.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   CAAP's business model is explicitly to "acquire, develop and operate airport concessions". (Q2 2025 Earnings Release, Aug 20, 2025)
    -   The primary risk factor for the company is the "early termination, revocation or failure to renew or extend any of our concession agreements". (Q2 2025 Earnings Release, Aug 20, 2025)
-   **Score:** 5 / 5

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
-   **Reasoning:** The airport business is extremely capital-intensive. The cost of building or acquiring and maintaining airport infrastructure (runways, terminals, etc.) is enormous, creating a powerful deterrent to new entrants. These assets are highly specific and cannot be repurposed.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   The nature of the airport business requires massive, specialized, and long-term capital investment, which is a significant barrier to entry. (Inference from the nature of the airport industry)
-   **Score:** 5 / 5

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
-   **Reasoning:** A significant portion of CAAP's revenue is regulated and tied to long-term concession agreements, providing a degree of visibility. However, revenues are also highly correlated with passenger traffic, which can be volatile and subject to macroeconomic conditions, as seen during the pandemic.
-   **Evidence:**
    -   Revenues are a mix of aeronautical (fees from airlines/passengers) and commercial (retail, etc.), both of which depend on passenger volumes. The 13.7% increase in passenger traffic in Q2 2025 drove an 18.9% increase in revenue. (Q2 2025 Earnings Release, Aug 20, 2025)
-   **Score:** 3 / 5

**Aggregation**

*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    (1 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (3 * 0.15) + (2 * 0.12) + (4 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (5 * 0.06) + (5 * 0.04) + (3 * 0.02) = 0.18 + 0.30 + 0.45 + 0.24 + 0.40 + 0.10 + 0.08 + 0.30 + 0.20 + 0.06 = **2.31**

*   **Final Weighted Score:** 58.2 / 100

**Mapping**

*   The weighted score of 58.2 falls into the 50 ≤ Weighted < 70 range, which maps to a final moat rating of 3.

**Moat Duration Justification**
The primary source of CAAP's moat is its portfolio of long-term government concessions. The duration of the moat is therefore directly tied to the remaining life of these agreements. The Argentina concession, which is the largest, is a key determinant. A conservative estimate of the weighted average life of its key concessions suggests a durable advantage for at least the next 10-15 years.

**Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios**
1.  **Non-Renewal of Key Concessions:** A failure to renew the concession for its Argentine airports, its largest market, would severely impair the company's moat.
2.  **Political and Regulatory Risk:** Governments, particularly in Latin America, could unilaterally change the terms of concession agreements, impose punitive taxes, or expropriate assets, eroding the value of CAAP's regulatory barriers.
3.  **Sustained Macroeconomic Downturn:** A prolonged global recession or another pandemic-style event could severely depress passenger traffic, undermining the unit economics that rely on scale and passenger throughput.

**KPIs to Monitor**
*   **Passenger Traffic Growth:** Monitor year-over-year growth across key markets (Argentina, Brazil, Italy). Deceleration could signal weakening demand.
*   **Revenue Per Passenger:** An increasing figure indicates effective management of commercial revenues and pricing power.
*   **Adjusted EBITDA Margin:** A stable or expanding margin demonstrates cost control and operating leverage.
*   **Concession Agreement Expiry Dates:** Track the remaining duration of key agreements.
*   **Capital Expenditures:** Monitor as a percentage of revenue to ensure investments are sustainable and generating returns.
*   **Country Risk Premium:** Changes in the political and economic stability of key operating countries.
*   **Regulatory Changes:** Any news or filings related to changes in the terms of concession agreements.
*   **Leverage Ratios (Net Debt / EBITDA):** To ensure financial stability.

**Short Verdict Paragraph**
Corporación América Airports S.A. possesses a moderate moat, warranting a 3/5 rating. The company's competitive advantage is almost entirely built on powerful regulatory barriers and the efficient scale derived from its exclusive, long-term concession agreements to operate critical airport infrastructure. These factors create local monopolies with formidable barriers to entry due to immense capital intensity. However, the moat is narrow, lacking reinforcement from other dimensions like network effects, switching costs, or intangible brand assets. The rating could be revised upwards with evidence of sustained, superior returns on invested capital and favorable renewals of its key concessions. Conversely, any political interference with its concessions or a failure to renew its Argentine agreement would significantly degrade the moat and lead to a lower rating.

moat rating is 3 / 5
