The company's founder, Frederick W. Smith, has stated that "If you're in a business and you don't innovate, you're in the process of commoditization or extinction."

**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of its latest quarterly report on February 28, 2025, FedEx has a strong balance sheet with $5.6 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company also has a history of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, which suggests it is not in need of equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of FedEx's recent earnings call transcripts shows a willingness from management to discuss both positive and negative aspects of the business. For example, in their Q3 2025 earnings call, they addressed the challenges in the freight segment while also highlighting the progress of their cost-saving initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** I was unable to find any evidence of significant legal or ethical issues with FedEx's management. The company has a code of conduct that all employees are expected to follow.
**Answer:** Yes

---
**Synthesis:**
FedEx scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and efforts to improve profitability. The company's strong brand and global network are significant competitive advantages. The biggest areas of uncertainty are around the depth and relations of its executive team and the effectiveness of its sales organization. The score could be most impacted in the next 12-24 months by the successful execution of the Network 2.0 and DRIVE initiatives, as well as the planned spin-off of the FedEx Freight division. A "No" could be flipped to a "Yes" for the sales organization with more data on customer retention and new business wins. Similarly, more insight into the company's succession planning and the backgrounds of its key operational leaders could change the score for management depth.

**fisher score is 12 / 15**
