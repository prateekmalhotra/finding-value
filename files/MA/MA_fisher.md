**Synthesis:** Mastercard scores highly on the Fisher checklist, reflecting its strong market position, consistent growth, and shareholder-friendly policies. The key strengths are its powerful brand, global network with strong network effects, and high profit margins. The score is unlikely to change significantly in the next 12-24 months, but a "No" could be triggered by a significant regulatory challenge that curtails its business practices, a major cybersecurity breach that damages its brand, or a failure to innovate in the face of new competition from fintech companies. To change a "No" to a "Yes" would require even greater transparency in areas like R&D spending, which is currently bundled with other expenses.

fisher score is 15 / 15
