### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Continued Passenger Traffic Growth in Argentina

*   **Type:** Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Argentina, CAAP's largest market, is experiencing a significant recovery in passenger traffic, with Q2 2025 international traffic up 18.5% year-over-year, setting a new record. This is driven by new routes and increased flight frequencies.
*   **Mechanism:** Increased passenger traffic directly translates to higher aeronautical revenues (passenger and landing fees) and non-aeronautical revenues (retail, parking, food and beverage). This revenue growth, with a semi-fixed cost base, leads to higher operating leverage and EBITDA margin expansion, ultimately increasing free cash flow and justifying a higher valuation.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 5% passenger growth in Argentina.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 10% passenger growth in Argentina.
    *   **High Scenario:** 15% passenger growth in Argentina.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-20%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. Rationale: The strong momentum from Q2 and July 2025 traffic figures, coupled with new routes, suggests a high likelihood of continued growth in the near term.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued economic stability in Argentina, no major new travel restrictions, and airlines maintaining or expanding their routes.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Monthly passenger traffic reports (especially for Argentina), airline route announcements, and Argentine economic data.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** A significant devaluation of the Argentine Peso could offset USD-denominated revenue gains. A sharp economic downturn in Argentina could reduce travel demand.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. Rationale: The strong, quantifiable growth in a key market provides a clear path to near-term earnings growth.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Margin Expansion from Operating Leverage

*   **Type:** Financial
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** With passenger traffic growing faster than operating expenses, CAAP is demonstrating operating leverage, leading to margin expansion. In Q2 2025, adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.4 percentage points to 38.6%.
*   **Mechanism:** As a significant portion of airport operating costs are fixed, each incremental dollar of revenue from increased passenger traffic contributes disproportionately to EBITDA and net income. This improved profitability can lead to a higher valuation multiple and increased earnings per share.
*   **Timing:** August 2025 – August 2026
*   **Quantification:**
    *   **Low Scenario:** 0.5 percentage point margin expansion.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 1.5 percentage point margin expansion.
    *   **High Scenario:** 2.5 percentage point margin expansion.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 10-15%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. Rationale: The company has a demonstrated ability to control costs and has already shown margin expansion in the most recent quarter.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Continued passenger traffic growth and disciplined cost management.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Quarterly reports of adjusted EBITDA margin, operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, and passenger traffic growth.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Higher-than-expected inflation in key markets could increase operating costs and erode margins. A slowdown in passenger traffic growth would reduce operating leverage.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. Rationale: Margin expansion is a powerful driver of earnings growth and is already being demonstrated in the company's financial results.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

**1. Catalyst Title:** Maturation of Growth Projects and Concession Renewals

*   **Type:** Operational / Strategic
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The company is advancing commercial initiatives, including the expansion of duty-free areas at Argentina's Ezeiza Airport and a new shopping mall at Brasília Airport in Brazil, scheduled to open in April 2026.
*   **Mechanism:** These projects will increase the leasable area and commercial offerings of the airports, leading to higher and more diversified revenue streams. Successful concession renewals in key markets will secure long-term cash flows and reduce uncertainty.
*   **Timing:** April 2026 and beyond.
*   **Quantification:** (Inference)
    *   **Low Scenario:** 5% increase in commercial revenue per passenger.
    *   **Base Scenario:** 10% increase in commercial revenue per passenger.
    *   **High Scenario:** 15% increase in commercial revenue per passenger.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** 15-25%
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 70%. Rationale: The projects are underway and have a clear timeline.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful and on-time completion of the projects, and favorable negotiations for concession renewals.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:** Company announcements on project milestones, capital expenditure updates, and news on concession negotiations.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:** Project delays or cost overruns could reduce the expected returns. Unfavorable terms in concession renewals could negatively impact long-term profitability.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. Rationale: While these are significant long-term drivers, they are still in development and subject to execution risk.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples (Short)**

**1. Continued Passenger Traffic Growth in Argentina:**

*   **Assumptions:** A 10% increase in passenger traffic in Argentina leads to a 5% increase in total company revenue (given Argentina's weight in the portfolio). With a 38.6% EBITDA margin, this translates to a roughly 5% increase in EBITDA.
*   **Valuation Impact:** Assuming a constant EV/EBITDA multiple, a 5% increase in EBITDA would lead to a 5% increase in the company's enterprise value.

**2. Margin Expansion from Operating Leverage:**

*   **Assumptions:** A 1.5 percentage point increase in the company's overall EBITDA margin from 38.6% to 40.1%.
*   **Valuation Impact:** On the same revenue base, this would lead to a roughly 3.9% increase in EBITDA (40.1/38.6 - 1), and therefore a similar increase in enterprise value, holding the EV/EBITDA multiple constant.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for CAAP is positive. The strong and accelerating passenger traffic growth, particularly in the key market of Argentina, combined with demonstrated operating leverage and margin expansion, provides a clear path to earnings growth in the next 0-12 months. While the possibility of a dividend or buyback is more speculative, the underlying operational and financial performance is strong.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  A severe economic crisis in Argentina, leading to a sharp currency devaluation and a collapse in travel demand.
2.  A global recession or a new pandemic that significantly reduces international travel.
3.  Unfavorable government intervention or regulatory changes in key markets, particularly Argentina, that negatively impact concession agreements.

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph (2–3 sentences)**

Based on the analysis, a "Buy" rating is recommended for CAAP. The top catalyst is the continued strong passenger traffic growth in Argentina, which is expected to drive a 10-20% upside in the share price in the near term. The most important indicator to monitor is the monthly passenger traffic reports, which will provide the earliest indication of whether this growth trajectory is being maintained.
