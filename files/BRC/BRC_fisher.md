### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady's R&D expenses have consistently increased, rising to $67.7 million (5.1% of net sales) in fiscal 2024 from $61.4 million (4.6%) in fiscal 2023. For the first nine months of fiscal 2025, R&D expenses were $56.8 million, or 5.1% of net sales, driven by the acquisition of Gravotech and increased headcount in the organic business. This level of investment as a percentage of sales is substantial for an industrial manufacturing company and demonstrates a clear focus on innovation. The company states that the majority of its R&D spending supports its identification products, focusing on materials, printing systems, and software.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady utilizes a multi-channel sales approach, including distributors, a direct sales force, and digital channels (brand-specific websites and catalogs). This diversified strategy allows it to reach a broad customer base across many industries. The company has long-standing relationships with a range of distributors, and its direct sales force provides specialized technical expertise. Management's stated initiatives include expanding and enhancing sales capabilities through an improved digital presence and data-driven marketing automation, indicating a focus on modernizing and improving its sales function. Consistent organic sales growth further suggests an effective sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady has demonstrated strong and improving profitability. Gross margin increased to 51.3% in fiscal 2024 from 49.4% in fiscal 2023. For the nine months ended April 30, 2025, gross margin was 50.2%. Operating margin has also been robust, increasing to 18.1% in fiscal 2024 from 16.9% in fiscal 2023. While the operating margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2025 dipped slightly to 15.9%, this was impacted by non-recurring acquisition-related costs and reorganization activities. These margins are healthy for a manufacturing-based business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively focused on maintaining profitability through several key initiatives. These include using pricing mechanisms to mitigate inflation and supply chain impacts, driving operational excellence, and executing sustainable efficiency gains in both manufacturing and administrative functions. Specific actions mentioned include insourcing critical products and manufacturing activities. The company also seeks to offset cost pressures through targeted price increases, strategic sourcing adjustments, and product portfolio optimization. The increase in gross margin from 49.4% in fiscal 2023 to 51.3% in fiscal 2024 reflects the success of these actions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K report details its human capital strategy, focusing on health and safety, diversity and inclusion, and talent development. Brady reports key safety metrics, with a Total Recordable Incident Rate (TRIR) of 0.52 and a Lost Time Case Rate (LTCR) of 0.23 for fiscal 2024, indicating a strong focus on employee safety. The company also emphasizes its culture of diversity and inclusion, with employee resource groups and accountability measures for senior leaders. As of July 31, 2024, the company employed approximately 5,700 individuals worldwide, and there are no mentions of significant labor disputes or union-related issues in the recent filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a track record of internal promotion. CEO Russell R. Shaller joined in 2015 and was promoted to CEO in 2022. CFO Ann E. Thornton has been with the company since 2009 and was promoted to CFO in 2023. The company has a Management Development and Compensation Committee that oversees executive compensation and development, and executive compensation is tied to performance with clear metrics. The company also has a clawback policy for incentive compensation, which aligns executive interests with accurate financial reporting.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady's leadership structure includes presidents for its two main geographic segments (Americas & Asia and EMEA & Australia) as well as a Chief Operating Officer, General Counsel, and CFO, indicating a clear division of operational and functional responsibilities below the CEO. The promotion of internal candidates to key roles, such as the current CEO, CFO, and COO, suggests the company develops talent from within and has a succession pipeline. For instance, Thomas F. DeBruine, who has been with the company since 2000, was appointed COO in June 2024 after serving as VP of Global Operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's independent auditor, Deloitte & Touche LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of July 31, 2024. Management's report on internal control also concluded that controls were effective. The company provides detailed segment reporting with profit breakouts for its two geographic regions, allowing for clear analysis. There is no recent history of material weaknesses or financial restatements mentioned in the filings.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the industrial identification market, key advantages include material science expertise, brand reputation, and a broad distribution network. Brady's business is built on manufacturing differentiated, proprietary products, many of which are internally developed, involving precision coating and specialized adhesives. The company owns numerous patents and tradenames, which, while not individually critical, collectively form a competitive moat. Its multi-channel sales model, combining a global direct sales force with a vast distributor network, provides a significant advantage in reaching a highly fragmented customer base.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management consistently states that its strategy is focused on long-term growth through investment in R&D and strategic acquisitions, even when these actions impact short-term results. For example, the MD&A section of the Q3 2025 10-Q notes that operating income was partially offset by "non-recurring acquisition-related costs" and increased R&D spending, demonstrating a willingness to invest for the future. The company's commitment to "investing in new product development to drive long-term organic sales growth" is a recurring theme. This focus on innovation and market expansion, despite near-term costs, points to a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Brady's financial position is strong, characterized by consistent positive cash flow from operations ($255.1 million in fiscal 2024). As of April 30, 2025, the company had $152.2 million in cash and a credit agreement with $195.2 million available for borrowing. Historically, the company has funded growth and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flow and debt, not equity financing. Furthermore, Brady has an active share repurchase program, buying back $33.2 million of stock in the nine months ended April 30, 2025, which is anti-dilutive.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](httpshttps://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) sections in both the 10-K and 10-Q reports provide detailed explanations of performance drivers, including challenges. For example, in the Q3 2025 10-Q, the company openly discusses an organic sales decline of 5.4% in the Europe & Australia segment and attributes the decrease in gross margin percentage to the impact of tariffs and reorganization costs. This level of transparent discussion about both positive and negative factors in its financial reports suggests a culture of candor.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-20250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of recent filings reveals no significant red flags regarding management integrity. The "Legal Proceedings" sections state that the company is not a party to any material pending litigation that would have a material adverse effect on its financial statements. The company has a code of ethics that applies to all employees, officers, and directors. The auditor's report is unqualified, and management has certified the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting. There is no mention of significant related-party transactions, regulatory investigations, or code-of-conduct breaches.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-250430.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659825000030/brc-250430.htm) (Filed May 16, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/746598/000074659824000065/brc-20240731.htm) (Filed September 6, 2024)

Synthesis:
Brady Corporation scores positively across all of Philip A. Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a fundamentally strong business with a long-term strategic focus. The company's strengths lie in its consistent investment in R&D and strategic M&A to drive future growth, its robust and improving profit margins, a strong balance sheet, and a stable, experienced management team that appears to operate with integrity and transparency. The most critical variables that could change this score in the next 12-24 months revolve around the successful integration of its recent acquisitions (Gravotech, AB&R, Microfluidic Solutions) and their ability to translate into accelerated organic growth. Another key factor will be the company's performance in its Europe & Australia segment, which has shown recent organic sales declines. Evidence of successful synergy realization from the new businesses or a return to sustained organic growth in Europe would solidify the current high score. Conversely, integration stumbles or persistent weakness in Europe could turn points related to sales runway and margin improvement from "Yes" to "No".

fisher score is 15 / 15
