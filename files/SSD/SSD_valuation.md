### D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents cash available to all capital providers (debt and equity) and is independent of capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation (SBC) - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 2,377.4 | 2,472.5 | 2,559.0 | 2,635.8 | 2,714.9 |
| EBIT (Op. Margin 19.5%) | 463.6 | 482.1 | 499.0 | 514.0 | 529.4 |
| Tax on EBIT (26.0%) | (120.5) | (125.4) | (129.7) | (133.6) | (137.6) |
| **NOPAT** | **343.1** | **356.8** | **369.3** | **380.3** | **391.8** |
| Add: D&A | 92.7 | 96.4 | 99.8 | 102.8 | 105.9 |
| Less: Stock-Based Comp | (22.6) | (23.5) | (24.3) | (25.0) | (25.8) |
| Less: Capex | (160.0) | (123.6) | (128.0) | (131.8) | (135.7) |
| Less: Change in WC | (20.5) | (19.0) | (17.3) | (15.4) | (15.8) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)** | **232.7** | **287.0** | **299.5** | **311.0** | **320.3** |

### E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM) = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.31% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, Aug 21, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.0% (Standard market premium).
    *   **Beta:** 1.29 (Source: FINVIZ). This beta, being greater than 1, reflects that the company's stock is more volatile than the overall market, which is reasonable for a company tied to the cyclical construction industry.
    *   **Cost of Equity** = 4.31% + 1.29 * 5.0% = **10.76%**
*   **Cost of Debt**
    *   **Pre-Tax Cost of Debt:** 5.81% (Risk-Free Rate of 4.31% + Credit Spread of 1.5%).
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt** = 5.81% * (1 - 26.0%) = **4.30%**
*   **WACC = (E/V * Re) + (D/V * Rd * (1-T))**
    *   **Market Capitalization (E):** $7,878.7 M ($187.59 share price * 42.0 M shares).
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $477.2 M.
    *   **Total Value (V):** $7,878.7 M + $477.2 M = $8,355.9 M.
    *   **WACC** = (7878.7/8355.9 * 10.76%) + (477.2/8355.9 * 4.30%) = **10.39%**

### F) TERMINAL VALUE

*   **Gordon Growth Method**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.5% (Assumed to be in line with long-term inflation).
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = [FCFF_Yr5 * (1 + g)] / (WACC - g)
    *   **Terminal Value** = [320.3 * (1 + 0.025)] / (0.1039 - 0.025) = **$4,158.4 M**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** EBIT(529.4) + D&A(105.9) = $635.3 M.
    *   **Exit Multiple:** Using a conservative 10x multiple, in line with mature industrial companies.
    *   **Terminal Value (Multiple)** = $635.3 M * 10.0 = **$6,353 M**
*   **Conclusion:** The Gordon Growth method provides a more conservative terminal value ($4,158.4 M) and will be used for the base-case valuation.

### G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:**
    *   = (232.7/1.1039^1) + (287.0/1.1039^2) + (299.5/1.1039^3) + (311.0/1.1039^4) + (320.3/1.1039^5)
    *   = 210.8 + 236.0 + 222.1 + 209.1 + 195.4 = **$1,073.4 M**
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** = 4,158.4 / (1.1039^5) = **$2,536.4 M**
*   **Enterprise Value (EV):** = $1,073.4 M + $2,536.4 M = **$3,609.8 M**
*   **Equity Value = EV - Net Debt**
    *   **Net Debt:** Total Debt ($477.2 M) - Cash ($190.4 M) = $286.8 M.
    *   **Equity Value** = $3,609.8 M - $286.8 M = **$3,323.0 M**

### H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY

*   **Base-Case Fair Value = Equity Value / Diluted Shares**
    *   = $3,323.0 M / 42.0 M = **$79.12 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** **$79.12**. This assumes management meets guidance and growth moderates.
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** **$58.00**. This reflects a recessionary scenario with 0% revenue growth, margin compression to 17.5%, and a higher discount rate (11.5%).
    *   **High/Bull Case:** **$105.00**. This assumes stronger-than-expected housing market, resulting in 6% initial revenue growth, margin expansion to 21%, and a lower discount rate (9.5%).
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   Applying a **25%** discount to the base-case value.
    *   **MOS Price** = $79.12 * (1 - 0.25) = **$59.34**

### One-paragraph Risk Notes

Key risks to this valuation include Simpson's significant dependence on the U.S. new residential construction market, which is cyclical and sensitive to interest rates. A sharp downturn in housing starts would negatively impact revenue and profitability. The company is also exposed to raw material price volatility, particularly steel, which could compress margins if cost increases cannot be passed on to customers. Furthermore, the construction industry is highly competitive, and failure to innovate or maintain strong distribution relationships could lead to market share loss. Finally, the successful integration of recent and future acquisitions is crucial to realizing projected synergies and growth.
