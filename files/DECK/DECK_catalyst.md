### **3) Near-Term Catalysts (0–12 months)**

---

**1. Catalyst Title:** Aggressive Share Repurchase Program
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On May 21, 2025, the Board of Directors approved a new, additional authorization of $2.25 billion for share repurchases under the company's existing program. This is in addition to the $290.7 million remaining under the previous authorization as of May 9, 2025.
*   **Mechanism:** A large-scale share repurchase program reduces the number of shares outstanding, which directly increases Earnings Per Share (EPS), assuming net income remains constant. This accretion to EPS can make the stock appear cheaper on a P/E basis, attracting new investors and driving the share price higher. It also signals management's confidence that the stock is undervalued and reflects a commitment to returning capital to shareholders.
*   **Timing:** May 2025 – May 2026. The authorization is effective immediately and these programs are typically executed over 12-24 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   Low Scenario: $1.0 billion repurchased over 12 months.
    *   **Base Scenario:**
        *   Total Authorization: $2,250,000,000 (New) + $290,704,000 (Remaining as of May 9, 2025) = **$2,540,704,000**.
        *   Market Capitalization (Approx. as of Sep 30, 2024): $24.14 billion.
        *   Repurchase as % of Market Cap: $2.54B / $24.14B ≈ **10.5%**.
        *   EPS Impact: A 10.5% reduction in share count could lead to an approximate 11.7% increase in EPS (1 / (1 - 0.105)).
    *   High Scenario: $2.0 billion repurchased over 12 months, aggressively capitalizing on any market weakness.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). A double-digit percentage reduction in shares outstanding provides a direct and quantifiable uplift to EPS, which should translate to a higher share price, supported by increased investor confidence.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 95%. The Board has formally authorized the funds and the company has a strong history of executing its buyback programs. The company's substantial cash balance of $1.89 billion as of March 31, 2025, and strong operating cash flow support the execution.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Market conditions must be favorable for execution. The company must continue generating strong free cash flow.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   "Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities" table in quarterly 10-Q filings.
    *   "Cash flows from financing activities" section of the cash flow statement.
    *   Weighted-average shares outstanding in quarterly earnings reports.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  Management could slow repurchases if the stock price appreciates too rapidly.
    2.  A large acquisition opportunity could divert capital away from the buyback.
    3.  A significant downturn in business performance could reduce the cash available for repurchases.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The scale of the repurchase program provides a significant and well-defined catalyst for EPS growth and shareholder return over the next 12 months.

**2. Catalyst Title:** Continued HOKA Growth Exceeding Expectations
*   **Type:** Operational / Product
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** The HOKA brand continues its rapid growth trajectory, with fiscal 2025 net sales increasing 23.6% to $2.23 billion. Management continues to prioritize the brand's global expansion, particularly in DTC and international markets.
*   **Mechanism:** Sustained revenue growth at rates above 20% would likely lead to upward revisions of analyst estimates and company guidance. Such "beat and raise" quarters reinforce the narrative of HOKA as a premier growth asset in the footwear industry, justifying a premium valuation multiple (P/E, EV/Sales) for DECK as a whole.
*   **Timing:** Each quarterly earnings report over the next 12 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   FY2025 HOKA Revenue: $2,233,090,000.
    *   Low Scenario (18% growth): $2,233M * 1.18 = $2,635M, an increase of ~$402M.
    *   **Base Scenario (22% growth):** $2,233M * 1.22 = **$2,724M**, an increase of **~$491M**.
    *   High Scenario (26% growth): $2,233M * 1.26 = $2,814M, an increase of ~$581M.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-30%). HOKA is the primary growth engine for the company. A significant beat driven by HOKA's performance would have a material impact on investor sentiment and valuation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 85%. The brand has demonstrated powerful momentum, product innovation, and growing global awareness. The primary uncertainty is the law of large numbers, making it harder to maintain such high growth rates.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Successful new product launches must resonate with consumers. International expansion and DTC build-out must be executed effectively.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   HOKA brand net sales growth (YoY %) in quarterly reports.
    *   HOKA's channel mix (DTC vs. Wholesale).
    *   HOKA's geographic mix (Domestic vs. International).
    *   Industry channel checks on sell-through rates at key retailers.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  Intensifying competition from brands like On Running and other major athletic companies.
    2.  A shift in consumer footwear trends away from the "maximalist cushioning" style.
    3.  Execution risk in scaling international operations and supply chains.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The momentum behind HOKA appears durable and represents the single most important fundamental driver for the company in the near term.

**3. Catalyst Title:** Positive Signal from Insider Buying
*   **Type:** Corporate Action
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** On June 6, 2025, Director Cindy L. Davis purchased 1,825 shares for a total value of approximately $200,319. This purchase occurred on the open market and was not related to an option exercise.
*   **Mechanism:** Insider purchases signal confidence from individuals with the most intimate knowledge of the company's prospects. This can provide a positive sentiment catalyst, encouraging other investors to buy the stock and potentially leading to a short-term price increase as the market prices in this new information.
*   **Timing:** Immediate (June 2025). The signal has been sent; any market reaction would be in the near term.
*   **Quantification:** The direct impact is negligible, but the signal is important.
    *   Low/Base/High Scenarios are not applicable for quantification of direct financial impact. The value is in the signal, which is hard to quantify financially.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Small (0-5%). The purchase is not large enough to move the needle on its own, but it provides a positive data point that can support the broader investment thesis and may attract additional investor interest.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 100% (the event has occurred). The probability of it acting as a meaningful catalyst is lower, perhaps 60%, as it is a single transaction.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** For a stronger signal, this would need to be followed by more purchases from other insiders (cluster buying).
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   SEC Form 4 filings for DECK insiders.
    *   Insider trading summaries on sites like openinsider.com.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  The purchase was an isolated event, not part of a broader trend of insider buying.
    2.  Other insiders have been net sellers, although many of these sales appear to be part of pre-arranged 10b5-1 plans.
    3.  The size of the purchase is small relative to the company's market capitalization.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Watch. While a positive data point, it is not substantial enough to be a primary investment thesis driver. It serves as a good piece of corroborating evidence for a bullish stance.

### **4) Long-Term Catalysts (12–60 months)**

---

**1. Catalyst Title:** HOKA Surpasses UGG as a Percentage of Revenue, Triggering Valuation Re-rating
*   **Type:** Financial / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** With HOKA's growth rate significantly outpacing UGG's, it is on a clear trajectory to become the company's largest brand by revenue. This shift would fundamentally change Deckers' business profile from a fashion-driven company to a performance athletic growth company, which typically commands higher valuation multiples.
*   **Mechanism:** The market currently applies a blended valuation multiple to DECK. As the higher-growth, less-seasonal HOKA business becomes the dominant revenue contributor, investors are likely to re-rate the entire company's stock to a multiple closer to that of other high-growth athletic footwear companies (e.g., On Holding), leading to significant share price appreciation.
*   **Timing:** 12–36 months.
*   **Quantification:** (Inference based on FY25 results)
    *   FY25 Revenue: HOKA $2.23B, UGG $2.53B.
    *   **Base Scenario Projection:**
        *   Assume HOKA grows at a 15% CAGR and UGG grows at a 6% CAGR.
        *   FY26 Est: HOKA $2.57B, UGG $2.68B.
        *   FY27 Est: HOKA **$2.95B**, UGG **$2.84B** (Crossover point).
    *   P&L Impact: A higher mix of HOKA revenue should support stable or expanding corporate-level gross margins. If the overall company's valuation multiple expands from 20x P/E to 25x P/E due to this re-rating, it would imply a 25% price uplift, holding earnings constant.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Large (>30%). A fundamental re-rating of the company's valuation multiple is one of the most powerful long-term drivers for a stock.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 75%. This is a highly plausible scenario based on current brand trajectories, but it depends on sustained execution and continued brand relevance for HOKA over multiple years.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** HOKA must maintain strong double-digit growth. UGG must remain stable and profitable.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   Quarterly revenue mix between HOKA and UGG.
    *   Growth rates of each brand.
    *   DECK's P/E and EV/Sales multiple relative to peers.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  HOKA's growth decelerates faster than anticipated.
    2.  UGG brand experiences a significant downturn, offsetting HOKA's growth.
    3.  The market continues to value DECK as a blended entity without giving it a "pure-play" growth multiple.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. This is the core long-term bullish thesis for the stock and current trends strongly support this potential outcome.

**2. Catalyst Title:** International & DTC Channel Mix Shift Drives Sustained Margin Expansion
*   **Type:** Financial / Operational
*   **Description (1–2 sentences):** Management has stated a strategic focus on growing the higher-margin Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) channel and expanding internationally. For fiscal 2025, international sales grew 26.3% and DTC sales grew 14.8%.
*   **Mechanism:** DTC sales carry a significantly higher gross margin than wholesale sales because the company captures the full retail price. As the DTC channel grows to become a larger percentage of total revenue, it will mechanically lift the company's overall gross and operating margins, leading to higher net income and free cash flow, even if overall revenue growth moderates.
*   **Timing:** 24–60 months.
*   **Quantification:**
    *   FY25 Sales Mix: Wholesale 57.3%, DTC 42.7% (Calculated from $2,856M Wholesale / $4,986M Total).
    *   **Base Scenario:**
        *   Assume DTC grows to 50% of total revenue in the next 3-5 years.
        *   Assume DTC gross margin is 1,500 basis points (15%) higher than wholesale.
        *   Impact: A 7.3% mix shift to DTC (50% - 42.7%) would increase the company's blended gross margin by approximately 7.3% * 15% = **1.10% or 110 basis points**.
    *   FCF Impact: A 110 bps margin expansion on ~$5B of revenue translates to ~$55M in additional gross profit, most of which would fall to free cash flow.
*   **Estimated Price Impact:** Medium (10-20%). A structural improvement in the company's margin profile is a significant value creator over the long term, supporting a higher share price through improved profitability and cash flow generation.
*   **Probability / Confidence (0–100%):** 80%. This is a core part of management's stated strategy and is supported by ongoing investments in e-commerce and retail stores for both HOKA and UGG.
*   **Key Dependencies / Conditions:** Investments in e-commerce platforms and physical retail must generate sufficient returns. The company must manage potential channel conflict with wholesale partners.
*   **Monitoring Triggers / KPIs:**
    *   DTC as a percentage of total sales in quarterly reports.
    *   Gross margin trends.
    *   International sales as a percentage of total sales.
*   **Anti-Catalysts / Risks:**
    1.  The high cost of operating DTC (marketing, shipping, returns) erodes the gross margin benefit.
    2.  Wholesale partners reduce orders in response to perceived competition from Deckers' own DTC channels.
    3.  International growth proves more difficult or less profitable than expected.
*   **Suggested Investor Action:** Buy. The margin expansion story is a logical and likely outcome of the company's current strategic direction, providing a secondary long-term driver to complement the HOKA growth story.

### **7) Valuation Sensitivity Examples**

**1. Share Repurchase EPS Accretion (Catalyst #1)**
This example demonstrates the potential EPS impact from executing the full repurchase authorization.

*   **Formula:** New EPS = (Current EPS * Current Shares) / (Current Shares - Shares Repurchased)
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Fiscal 2025 Diluted EPS: $6.33 (DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)
    *   Shares Issued and Outstanding (as of Mar 31, 2025): 150,201,000 (DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)
    *   Total Repurchase Authorization: $2,540,704,000
    *   Assumed Average Repurchase Price (Inference, conservative estimate): ~$165/share (approximate price from recent 10-K disclosure)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   Shares to be Repurchased: $2,540,704,000 / $165 ≈ 15,398,206 shares.
    *   New Share Count: 150,201,000 - 15,398,206 = 134,802,794 shares.
    *   Fiscal 2025 Net Income: $966,091,000 (DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)
    *   **Pro-forma EPS:** $966,091,000 / 134,802,794 = **$7.17**
*   **Result:** This represents a **13.3%** accretion to FY2025 EPS, demonstrating a direct and significant valuation impact.

**2. HOKA Incremental Operating Income (Catalyst #2)**
This example shows the potential operating income contribution from a strong year of HOKA growth.

*   **Formula:** Incremental Operating Income = Incremental HOKA Revenue * Assumed Incremental Operating Margin
*   **Inputs:**
    *   Incremental HOKA Revenue (Base Case): $491,000,000 (See Quantification in Near-Term Catalyst #2)
    *   HOKA Brand Income from Operations (FY2025): $848,505,000 (DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)
    *   HOKA Brand Net Sales (FY2025): $2,233,090,000 (DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)
    *   HOKA Operating Margin (FY2025): $848.5M / $2,233.1M = 38.0%
    *   Assumed Incremental Operating Margin (Inference, conservative): 30% (lower than current average to account for growth investments)
*   **Calculation:**
    *   **Incremental Operating Income:** $491,000,000 * 30% = **$147,300,000**
*   **Result:** This represents a potential 12.5% increase to the company's total FY2025 income from operations of $1,179,092,000 from just one year of HOKA's growth, showcasing its importance as the primary earnings driver.

### **8) Net Catalysts Balance & Short-Term Market Signal**

The balance of near-term catalysts for Deckers appears strongly positive. The market signal is bullish, underpinned by an exceptionally large share repurchase authorization that provides a clear and mechanical path to double-digit EPS accretion. This corporate action is supported by powerful fundamental momentum from the HOKA brand, which continues to grow at over 20% at scale. While risks from competition and macroeconomic factors exist, they are currently overshadowed by these potent, company-specific drivers. The small insider purchase, while not a major catalyst itself, adds to the positive sentiment.

### **10) Three Highest-Risk Events That Could Negate All Catalysts**

1.  **Severe Global Recession:** A significant global economic downturn could sharply curtail consumer discretionary spending on premium footwear, simultaneously hitting both UGG and HOKA sales volumes and pricing power. (Risk Factors, DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)
2.  **Sudden Deceleration in HOKA Growth:** If competition intensifies dramatically or the brand's fashion appeal fades, a rapid slowdown in HOKA's growth to low-single-digits would destroy the primary growth narrative and likely cause a severe de-rating of the stock's valuation multiple. (Risk Factors, DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)
3.  **Major Supply Chain Disruption:** Given the company's reliance on manufacturing in Southeast Asia, a major geopolitical event, trade war, or natural disaster impacting production or shipping from that region could lead to significant inventory shortages and an inability to meet demand. (Risk Factors, DECK 10-K, May 23, 2025)

### **11) Final Recommendation Paragraph**

The analysis supports a **Buy** recommendation for Deckers Outdoor Corp. The primary near-term catalyst is the substantial $2.54 billion share repurchase authorization, which provides a direct path for significant EPS accretion. This is powerfully combined with the ongoing operational catalyst of HOKA's brand momentum, which is expected to continue driving double-digit revenue growth. A conservative potential upside in the range of 15-25% is plausible over the next 0-12 months, driven by these factors. The single most important indicator to monitor will be the quarterly revenue growth rate of the HOKA brand, as this is the core driver of the long-term investment thesis.

### **12) Final Rating**

catalyst score is 4 / 5
