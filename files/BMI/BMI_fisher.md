### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Badger Meter’s growth is driven by the modernization of water infrastructure, a multi-year secular trend. The company’s core offering, smart water solutions including Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), addresses critical needs for water conservation, operational efficiency, and non-revenue water reduction for utilities. Sales in the utility water sector grew 20% in fiscal 2024, reflecting strong market adoption of its ORION Cellular AMI solutions and BEACON Software as a Service (SaaS) offerings. This trend is supported by a large installed base of older, mechanical meters that require upgrading.
**Answer:** Yes

### 2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management explicitly states in its 2024 Annual Report that maintaining its competitive advantage "will require continued investment in research and development, sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities." The company has a track record of innovation, evolving from mechanical meters to automated meter reading (AMR) and now to integrated AMI systems with software analytics. The introduction of the BlueEdge™ platform brand highlights a focus on simplifying and integrating a suite of solutions, indicating a forward-looking product strategy.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Badger Meter's R&D investment was approximately 3.5% of annual sales in 2024. This investment is focused on key growth areas like ultrasonic metering and its BEACON smart water software platform. The effectiveness is demonstrated by the market's strong adoption of its cellular AMI solutions, which drove 20% sales growth in the utility segment in 2024, indicating that its R&D output is commercially successful and aligns with market demands.
**Answer:** Yes

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company achieved record total sales of $238.1 million in Q2 2025, a 10% increase from the prior year. For the full year 2024, sales grew 18% to $826.6 million. This consistent, strong, double-digit growth, particularly in the competitive North American utility market where it is one of the top three players, suggests a highly effective sales organization that is successfully capitalizing on market trends and winning business.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Badger Meter demonstrates strong and improving profitability. For Q2 2025, the company reported an operating profit margin of 18.8% and a gross margin of 41.1%, the latter being a 170 basis point improvement over the prior year. For the full year 2024, the company expanded operating margins and improved EBITDA margins by 220 basis points to 23.0%. These margins are robust for a manufacturing and technology company and indicate strong pricing power and operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively improving margins through a favorable product mix, shifting sales towards higher-value AMI and SaaS solutions which carry higher margins than traditional meters. Gross margin improvement is also attributed to higher sales volumes, which allows the company to leverage its fixed costs. The company's ability to increase gross margin to 41.1% in Q2 2025 demonstrates effective cost management and pricing power despite inflationary pressures.
**Answer:** Yes

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The evidence is mixed. While the company states its employee survey shows high adherence to its core values, a shareholder proposal from April 2024 points to a rising employee turnover rate, which reached 10% in 2022, up from 4.3% in 2020. The proposal also raises concerns about low diversity at the management level. Given these credible, recent concerns about turnover and diversity, it is not possible to conclude that labor relations are "outstanding."
**Answer:** No

### 8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team demonstrates stability and a clear path of succession. The current Chairman, President, and CEO, Kenneth Bockhorst, was promoted internally from COO in 2019, a year after joining. The CFO, Robert Wrocklage, was also promoted from within. This pattern of internal promotion for key roles suggests a cohesive and well-regarded executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

### 9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, the company’s public leadership roster shows a full suite of experienced executives beyond the CEO and CFO, including VPs of Engineering, General Counsel, Human Resources, and Software. Many of these leaders have extensive experience at other major industrial corporations like Eaton, Actuant, and IDEX, bringing significant external expertise. The company also promotes from within, with the VP of Software and Water Quality having risen through the ranks since 2007, indicating a strong bench of talent.
**Answer:** Yes

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides clear segment reporting and regularly reports on metrics like gross and operating margins, along with explanations for their changes. The ability to increase gross margins by 170 basis points in Q2 2025 points to effective cost control. There is no evidence from the search results of recent restatements, internal control weaknesses, or auditor issues, suggesting that controls are adequate and effective.
**Answer:** Yes

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A key competitive advantage in the water utility industry is the breadth and integration of a company's technology portfolio. Badger Meter's strategy to offer a comprehensive suite of solutions—from meters to cellular network technology to analytical software (BEACON and BlueEdge)—creates a "one-stop shop" for utilities. This integration creates stickiness with customers and a competitive moat against rivals that may only offer point solutions. This is reflected in their estimate that they, along with two other companies, serve roughly 85% of the North American water meter market.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's actions demonstrate a long-range outlook. It has increased its dividend for 33 consecutive years, a policy that requires consistent, long-term financial planning and confidence in future earnings. Furthermore, management statements emphasize continued investment in R&D and personnel to support future growth, even as these investments impact near-term SEA expenses. This signals a focus on building durable competitive advantages over maximizing short-term profit.
**Answer:** Yes

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's financial position is very strong. In fiscal 2024, it generated $142.2 million in free cash flow, representing a conversion rate of 114% of net earnings. In Q2 2025, it generated another $44.6 million in cash from operations. This robust internal cash generation is more than sufficient to fund organic growth investments, acquisitions, and its consistently growing dividend, making dilutive equity financing highly unlikely.

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides regular quarterly earnings reports and holds conference calls, which is standard practice. The company's filings also contain extensive "Risk Factors" sections, and management explicitly disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements. While there is no evidence of management "clamming up" during a crisis, there is also no specific, verifiable evidence of them being unusually candid during a period of trouble. Per the decision rules, the absence of strong, positive evidence requires a "No."
**Answer:** No

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a formal ethics and compliance program and states that trust and integrity are its foremost core values. Search results reveal no major SEC investigations, FCPA violations, or material litigation related to management's integrity. The company has been in business for over a century and has a long track record of stable operations and consistent dividend payments, which are indirect indicators of a reliable and trustworthy management team.
**Answer:** Yes

Synthesis:
Badger Meter scores well on Fisher's checklist, exhibiting strong growth drivers, effective R&D, robust financials, and a stable, experienced management team. Its strongest positives are its position in the secular trend of water infrastructure modernization, its outstanding financial health marked by strong cash flow and margins, and its long-term perspective evidenced by 33 consecutive years of dividend growth. The primary negative is a recent rise in employee turnover and shareholder concerns about diversity, which casts doubt on the quality of its personnel relations. The score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months based on its ability to sustain margin expansion as sales growth inevitably moderates and whether it can address the employee turnover and diversity concerns. A reversal of the rising turnover trend and specific disclosures on diversity initiatives would be the key evidence needed to flip the "No" on Point 7 to a "Yes."

fisher score is 13 / 15
