### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**

Verbatim extracts from the Q2 2025 earnings call on August 6, 2025:

*   **Systemwide Sales:** "In the second quarter McDonald's delivered global systemwide sales growth of over 6% in constant currency..."
*   **Comparable Sales:** "...and global comparable sales growth of nearly 4%."
*   **Unit Growth:** "Finally we remain on pace to open approximately 2,200 restaurants globally this year... In total we continue to expect slightly over 4% unit growth from the nearly 1,800 net restaurant additions in 2025."
*   **Operating Margin:** "Adjusted operating margin was nearly 47% for the first half of the year highlighting the durability of our business model."

Management did not provide explicit, forward-looking percentage guidance for revenue or margins beyond the current year's trends.

---

### **C) Forecast & Assumptions (5-Year Horizon)**

*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):**
    *   **Rationale:** No explicit guidance was provided. Therefore, a rate reflecting a blend of recent performance and management commentary is appropriate. The latest quarter showed ~4% comparable sales growth and the company expects ~4% unit growth. A blend suggests strong potential, but to remain conservative and realistic, we will use a growth rate slightly below the sum of these two figures.
    *   **Assumption:** **5.0% annual revenue growth.** This is a conservative blend of organic growth and new store openings.

*   **Operating Margin (EBIT Margin):**
    *   **Rationale:** Management noted a strong adjusted operating margin of "nearly 47%" for the first half of 2025. The TTM EBIT margin is 46.1% ($12,022M / $26,060M). Given the company's scale and franchise-led model, and without specific management commentary on margin expansion initiatives, assuming a stable margin is a realistic base case.
    *   **Assumption:** **46.0% EBIT margin** held constant through the forecast period.

*   **Tax Rate:**
    *   **Rationale:** The TTM effective tax rate is 20.6%. The average over the last three full years (2022-2024) is approximately 20.0%.
    *   **Assumption:** A normalized effective tax rate of **21.0%** will be used to account for potential future shifts in tax policy.

*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** TTM Capex is $2,896M, or 11.1% of revenue. The 3-year average (2022-2024) is approximately 10.0% of revenue.
    *   **Assumption (Capex):** **11.0% of revenue**, aligning with recent levels to support store openings and technology investments.
    *   **Change in Working Capital:** Historically, this has been volatile but a small percentage of revenue.
    *   **Assumption (âˆ†WC):** **-1.0% of incremental revenue**, reflecting efficient management of operating assets and liabilities as the company grows. The negative sign indicates a source of cash, which is consistent with the TTM figure.

*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **Assumption (SBC):** Stock-Based Compensation is modeled at **0.7% of revenue**, consistent with the 3-year historical average.
    *   **Assumption (Shares):** The share count is held constant at the latest TTM figure of **719 million** for the per-share value calculation.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used because it represents the cash available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (USD, millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $27,363 | $28,731 | $30,168 | $31,676 | $33,260 |
| **EBIT (46.0%)** | **$12,587** | **$13,216** | **$13,877** | **$14,571** | **$15,296** |
| EBIT * (1-Tax) | $9,944 | $10,441 | $10,963 | $11,511 | $12,084 |
| + D&A (8.2% of Rev) | $2,244 | $2,356 | $2,474 | $2,597 | $2,727 |
| - SBC (0.7% of Rev) | ($192) | ($201) | ($211) | ($222) | ($233) |
| - Capex (11.0% of Rev) | ($3,010) | ($3,160) | ($3,318) | ($3,484) | ($3,659) |
| - Change in WC | $13 | $14 | $14 | $15 | $16 |
| **FCFF** | **$8,999** | **$9,450** | **$9,922** | **$10,417** | **$10,935** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Equity = Risk-Free Rate + Beta * Equity Risk Premium
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** **4.29%** (Source: YCharts, Aug 20, 2025, 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield)
    *   **Beta:** **0.52** (Source: Finbox, 5-Year Monthly Beta). This low beta is justified as McDonald's is a mature, non-cyclical consumer staples company with stable demand.
    *   **Equity Risk Premium (ERP):** **5.0%**. This is a standard, widely accepted premium for a mature market like the U.S.
    *   **Calculation:** 4.29% + 0.52 * 5.0% = **6.89%**

*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   **Formula:** Cost of Debt = Interest Expense / Total Debt
    *   **Calculation:** $1,526M / $55,892M = 2.73%.
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt:** 2.73% * (1 - 21.0%) = **2.16%**

*   **WACC:**
    *   **Formula:** WACC = (E / (E+D)) * Cost of Equity + (D / (E+D)) * Cost of Debt * (1 - Tax Rate)
    *   **Market Cap (E):** $225,105M (313.08 share price * 719M shares)
    *   **Market Value of Debt (D):** $55,892M
    *   **Calculation:** ($225,105 / $280,997) * 6.89% + ($55,892 / $280,997) * 2.16% = 5.51% + 0.43% = **5.94%**

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Rationale:** A terminal growth rate of 2.5% is selected, which is in line with long-term inflation expectations and reflects a mature company's long-run growth prospects.
    *   **Formula:** Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   **Calculation:** ($10,935M * (1 + 2.5%)) / (5.94% - 2.5%) = $11,208M / 3.44% = **$325,814M**

*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** $18,023M (EBIT $15,296M + D&A $2,727M)
    *   **Implied EV/EBITDA Multiple:** $325,814M / $18,023M = **18.1x**. This multiple is high compared to historical averages for the sector, suggesting the Gordon Growth value may be optimistic. As per instructions, the lower of the two values should be chosen if there is a significant discrepancy. A more conservative exit multiple of **15.0x** is chosen, which is more aligned with long-term sector averages for stable, large-cap companies.
    *   **Revised Terminal Value (Exit Multiple):** $18,023M * 15.0 = **$270,345M**

---

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **Present Value of FCFF (Years 1-5):** $43,456M
*   **Present Value of Terminal Value:** $270,345M / (1 + 5.94%)^5 = $202,573M
*   **Enterprise Value:** $43,456M + $202,573M = **$246,029M**
*   **Less: Net Debt:** $54,016M (Total Debt $55,892M - Cash $1,876M) (StockAnalysis, Aug 21, 2025)
*   **Equity Value:** $246,029M - $54,016M = **$192,013M**

---

### **H) Per-Share Valuation and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **Calculation:** $192,013M Equity Value / 719M Diluted Shares = **$267.06 per share**

*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $267.** Assumes 5.0% revenue growth and stable 46.0% EBIT margins.
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $215.** Assumes a more pessimistic scenario with 3.0% revenue growth due to heightened competition and consumer spending pressure, and margin compression to 44.0%.
    *   **High/Bull Case: $325.** Assumes a more optimistic scenario with 6.5% revenue growth driven by successful menu innovation and accelerated digital adoption, with slight margin expansion to 47.0%.

*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **Calculation (30% below Base Case):** $267.06 * (1 - 0.30) = **$186.94**

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Consumer Discretionary Spending:** McDonald's performance is sensitive to changes in global consumer spending, which can be negatively impacted by inflation, unemployment, and economic downturns.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The quick-service restaurant (QSR) industry is intensely competitive. Failure to innovate on menu, price, and digital experience could lead to market share loss.
3.  **Franchisee Relations:** The company's success is heavily dependent on the financial health and operational execution of its independent franchisees. Any significant friction in this relationship could harm systemwide sales and brand perception.
4.  **Regulatory Risk:** The business is subject to a wide array of regulations, including health, safety, and employment laws. Changes in these regulations, particularly regarding wages or food standards, could increase operating costs.
5.  **Input Cost Volatility:** Fluctuations in the prices of key commodities like beef, chicken, and dairy can impact restaurant-level profitability and potentially necessitate price increases that could deter customers.
