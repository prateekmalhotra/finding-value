**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a stable and experienced executive team. Andrew Anagnost has served as CEO since 2017, and other key executives have been with the company for several years. The recent internal investigation into the company's free cash flow and non-GAAP operating margin practices, however, raises some concerns about the company's internal controls and the potential for friction at the executive level. The investigation, completed in May 2025, did not result in any restatements of financial statements, but it did identify areas for improvement.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000071/adsk-20250430.htm']

**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The recent internal investigation into the company's accounting practices is a significant concern. While the investigation did not result in a restatement of the company's financial statements, it did reveal weaknesses in its processes. The company has stated that it is taking remedial action to improve its internal controls. Until these actions are fully implemented and proven to be effective, the quality of the company's cost analysis and accounting controls must be questioned.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000071/adsk-20250430.htm']

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk benefits from high switching costs, as its software is deeply embedded in its customers' workflows. This creates a strong "moat" that protects the company from competition. Autodesk's large and active user community, as well as its extensive network of third-party developers, also create a powerful network effect that reinforces its market leadership.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm']

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Autodesk's business model transition from selling perpetual licenses to subscriptions demonstrates a willingness to sacrifice short-term revenue for a more predictable, long-term stream of recurring revenue. The company's consistent and significant investment in R&D, even at the expense of short-term margin expansion, further highlights its focus on long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000019/adsk-20250131.htm']

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of April 30, 2025, Autodesk had $1.98 billion in cash and cash equivalents. The company consistently generates strong free cash flow. Autodesk has a share repurchase program in place, which demonstrates a commitment to returning capital to shareholders and mitigating dilution. Given its strong financial position and cash flow generation, the risk of significant equity dilution is low.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000071/adsk-20250430.htm']

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's handling of the recent internal investigation has been mixed. While Autodesk did disclose the investigation and its findings, the initial delay in its financial reporting and the lack of detail in its initial communications caused some concern among investors. However, the company did hold a conference call to discuss the findings and answer questions, which suggests a willingness to be transparent.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000071/adsk-20250430.htm']

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The internal investigation into the company's accounting practices, while not resulting in a financial restatement, is a serious issue that raises questions about management's integrity. The investigation found that the company's executives had taken actions that were intended to influence the company's financial results. While the company is taking remedial action, this episode has damaged management's credibility.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** ['https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/769397/000076939725000071/adsk-20250430.htm']

Synthesis:
Autodesk scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its strong market position, profitable business model, and commitment to innovation. However, the recent internal investigation into the company's accounting practices is a major concern that has led to "No" answers on several key points related to management's integrity and the company's internal controls. The score is most likely to change in the next 12-24 months based on the company's ability to successfully implement the remedial actions it has identified and to rebuild trust with investors. A clean bill of health from its auditors in the next fiscal year, coupled with a period of greater transparency and predictability, would be key to flipping the "No" answers to "Yes."

fisher score is 11 / 15
