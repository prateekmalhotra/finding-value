### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation as it represents cash flows available to all capital providers.

**FCFF Formula:** `EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Compensation - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue** | **$707.5** | **$813.6** | **$919.4** | **$1,029.7**| **$1,132.7**|

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (10-Year U.S. Treasury, August 19, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5% (Standard market assumption)
    *   **Beta:** 2.04 (MarketBeat, August 18, 2025). This high beta reflects the stock's volatility and the inherent risks of the restaurant industry.
    *   *Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 2.04 \* 5.5% = 15.52%*
*   **Cost of Debt:** 6.30% (Estimated as the risk-free rate plus a 2% spread)
*   **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Cap (Equity): $1,046.32M ($9.02/share \* 116M shares)
    *   Market Value of Debt: $338.73M
    *   *WACC = (1046.32 / 1385.05) \* 15.52% + (338.73 / 1385.05) \* 6.30% \* (1 - 0) = 13.26%*

### **F) Terminal Value**

*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   Terminal Growth Rate (g): 2.5% (Long-run inflation expectation)
    *   Terminal Value = (Year 5 FCFF \* (1 + g)) / (WACC - g)
    *   Terminal Value = (-$167.7 \* 1.025) / (13.26% - 2.5%) = -$1,598.6M
    *   PV of Terminal Value = -$1,598.6M / (1 + 13.26%)^5 = -$861.8M
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = EBIT + D&A = -$56.6M + $97.9M = $41.3M
    *   Exit Multiple: 15.0x (A conservative multiple for a growing but not yet highly profitable restaurant chain)
    *   Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $41.3M \* 15.0 = $619.5M
    *   PV of Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = $619.5M / (1 + 13.26%)^5 = $333.9M

Given the significant discrepancy, the more conservative **Exit Multiple method** will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

*   **PV of Explicit FCFF:** -$547.2M
*   **PV of Terminal Value:** $333.9M
*   **Enterprise Value:** -$547.2M + $333.9M = -$213.3M
*   **Less: Net Debt** (Total Debt - Cash)
    *   Total Debt: $338.73M (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   Cash & Equivalents: $168.45M (StockAnalysis.com, Aug 20, 2025)
    *   Net Debt = $170.28M
*   **Equity Value:** -$213.3M - $170.28M = -$383.58M

---

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Equity Value / Diluted Shares
    *   -$383.58M / 116.0M = **-$3.31 per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** -$3.31
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** The valuation is already negative, implying no intrinsic value based on this DCF model. A more pessimistic scenario with lower growth (e.g., 10% tapering to 5%) and no margin improvement would result in a more negative value.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** A more optimistic scenario with higher revenue growth (e.g., 20% tapering to 15%) and achieving a 5% positive operating margin by Year 5 could lead to a positive, albeit low, valuation.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   As the base-case value is negative, a traditional MOS price cannot be calculated.

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Path to Profitability:** The company has a history of significant losses. The valuation is highly sensitive to the assumption of improving operating margins.
2.  **Competition:** The fast-casual restaurant industry is highly competitive, which could pressure same-store sales and margins.
3.  **Execution Risk:** Aggressive store growth plans carry execution risk and may not deliver expected returns.
4.  **Consumer Spending:** A slowdown in consumer discretionary spending could negatively impact traffic and sales.
5.  **High Stock-Based Compensation:** SBC is a significant and recurring expense that dilutes shareholder value.

final answer is -3.31 $
