I have reviewed the 2024 10-K, and I have a good understanding of the company's business. I'll now proceed with answering the 15 questions, using the 10-K as my primary source. I will also use the information I found about the latest earnings release (Q2 2025) even though I could not access the full transcript or presentation.

Here is the information I have collected so far:
- **Strategy:** Brink's strategy is focused on growing by providing a superior customer experience and driving continuous improvement. Key pillars are: Partner for Customer Success, Innovate to Grow, Run the Business Better, and Win as Team Brink's. They are focusing on accelerating revenue growth, margin improvement and cash flows.
- **Services:** Brink's offers Cash and Valuables Management (CVS), Digital Retail Solutions (DRS), and ATM Managed Services (AMS). In 2024, CVS accounted for 76% of revenues, while DRS and AMS accounted for 24%.
- **Competition:** Major competitors include Loomis, Prosegur, and Garda World Security. Brink's believes its competitive advantages are its brand name, reputation for service and security, risk management expertise, global network, and operational excellence.
- **Human Capital:** Brink's employs approximately 68,100 people, with about 88% located outside the U.S. Approximately 45% of the workforce is unionized. Employee safety is a key priority.
- **Acquisitions:** The company has been active in making acquisitions, including the purchase of NoteMachine in the UK in 2022.
- **Financials:** I have access to the consolidated financial statements, including the income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. I also have segment-level data.

Now I will go through each of the 15 points and formulate my response. I will use the 2024 10-K as the primary source and cite it accordingly. If I cannot find specific information for a point, I will state that and answer "No".

Here's the final output, starting with the one-line overview.

Company, date of analysis, primary sources reviewed.
The Brink's Company (BCO), August 24, 2025, 2024 Form 10-K.

1) Products/Services with Long Runway
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Brink’s Company is shifting its focus to higher-growth, tech-enabled solutions like Digital Retail Solutions (DRS) and ATM Managed Services (AMS). These services, which constituted 24% of revenue in 2024, are growing faster than the traditional Cash and Valuables Management (CVS) business. The company's strategy is to "Innovate to Grow by using tech-enabled solutions to introduce new value propositions and optimize operations." While the use of physical cash is declining in some regions, it remains a popular form of payment globally, and Brink's is developing new services to make cash more competitive.
**Answer:** Yes

2) Commitment to Ongoing Development
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management’s strategic pillars, “Innovate to Grow” and “Run the Business Better,” explicitly target ongoing development. The company is investing in technology to enhance its offerings, particularly in the DRS and AMS segments. The 10-K states a focus on "Leveraging technology to drive product and business innovation to maintain our competitive advantage and increase revenue." Recent acquisitions, such as NoteMachine in the UK, also demonstrate a commitment to expanding their ATM managed services.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s 10-K does not provide specific metrics on R&D spending, such as R&D as a percentage of revenue, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the company does hold patents for services like Brink's CompleteTM and CompuSafe®, with expiration dates between 2028 and 2040, which suggests some level of R&D effectiveness. Without more detailed disclosures on R&D investment and output, it is difficult to assess the effectiveness relative to its size.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

4) Above-Average Sales Organization
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategic pillar, "Partner for Customer Success," focuses on creating a consistent and exceptional customer experience and deploying sales fundamentals and standardized processes. However, the 10-K does not provide specific metrics on sales organization performance, such as customer retention rates, new customer acquisition rates, or sales productivity. Without such data, it's not possible to definitively say that the sales organization is above average.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

5) Worthwhile Profit Margins
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In 2024, Brink's reported a GAAP operating profit margin of 9.0%, an increase from 8.7% in 2023 and 8.0% in 2022. The non-GAAP operating margin was 12.6% in 2024, the same as in 2023, and up from 12.1% in 2022. While the company faces pricing pressure in a competitive industry, the trend of improving margins is a positive sign.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

6) Margin Improvement Actions
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is actively pursuing margin improvement through its "Run the Business Better" strategy, which focuses on leveraging the Brink's Business System to drive a continuous improvement culture and building scale by sharing activities, infrastructure, and knowledge. The company is also focused on growing its higher-margin DRS and AMS businesses. The 2022 Global Restructuring Plan, which was substantially completed in 2024, was also aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Approximately 45% of Brink's global workforce is represented by unions, with collective bargaining agreements expiring between 2025 and 2028. The company states in its 10-K that "We believe our employee relations are satisfactory." However, the 10-K also notes that labor shortages and increased labor costs could have a material adverse effect on operations. Without more specific data on employee turnover, engagement scores, or a history of labor disputes, it is difficult to classify their labor relations as "outstanding."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

8) Executive Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team has seen some recent changes. Mark Eubanks was appointed CEO in May 2022, and Kurt McMaken became CFO in August 2022. There have been other recent appointments to key leadership roles as well. While this indicates a period of transition, it does not necessarily signal poor executive relations. The company has a standard corporate governance structure with a board of directors.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

9) Depth of Management
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 10-K lists seven executive officers, including the CEO and CFO, with presidents for each of its major geographic segments (North America, Latin America, and Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia). This suggests a good level of management depth at the senior level. The company also states that it is focused on "accelerating the development of our leaders through various programs such as our 'Future Leaders' program."
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company’s independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2024, stating that they “present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company.” While the company identified a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting in 2022, this was fully remediated by December 31, 2023. This suggests that the company has taken steps to improve its accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the cash logistics industry, a key competitive advantage is a dense and efficient route-based network. Brink's global network of approximately 1,300 facilities and 16,100 vehicles provides significant scale and density. The company's focus on "sharing infrastructure and best practices across our operations to increase scale and profitability" is a key element of its strategy. The company's strong brand recognition and reputation for security are also critical in an industry where trust is paramount.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategy is focused on long-term growth through its transformation initiatives and investment in new technologies. The 10-K states that the company is focused on how it will "accelerate revenue growth, margin improvement and cash flows and position Brink's to win across the evolving payments ecosystem." This language suggests a long-term perspective. The company's investments in its DRS and AMS segments, which may have required upfront costs, also point to a focus on long-term profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of December 31, 2024, the company had $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $600 million available under its revolving credit facility. The company generated $400 million in free cash flow before dividends in 2024. The company has a share repurchase program in place, which suggests that it is not currently planning to issue new equity. Debt as a percentage of capitalization was high at 93% at the end of 2024, but the company's strong cash flow should be sufficient to fund its growth initiatives.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company provides detailed financial information in its SEC filings, including a comprehensive Management's Discussion and Analysis section. The company also discloses significant legal proceedings, such as the investigations by the DOJ and FinCEN. This transparency suggests a willingness to be candid with investors.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In January 2025, a subsidiary of the company, Brink's Global Services USA, entered into a Consent Order with FinCEN and a Non-Prosecution Agreement with the DOJ to resolve investigations into anti-money laundering compliance. The company agreed to pay $42 million as part of these resolutions. While the company has taken steps to resolve these issues, the existence of such an investigation raises questions about the company's compliance culture and, by extension, the integrity of its management.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/78890/000007889025000059/bco-20241231.htm, February 26, 2025]

---
Synthesis (5–7 sentences): The Brink's Company scores fairly well on Fisher's checklist, with strengths in its long-range profit outlook, margin improvement actions, and strong competitive position in the cash logistics industry. The company's push into higher-growth digital and ATM services is a positive sign for future growth. However, the score is held back by a lack of detailed disclosure on R&D and sales organization effectiveness, as well as some concerns about labor relations and executive stability. The recent settlement with the DOJ and FinCEN over AML compliance issues is a significant red flag that raises questions about management's integrity. The key variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of its growth strategy in the DRS and AMS segments, improved transparency on R&D and sales metrics, and a clean bill of health from a compliance perspective.

fisher score is 10 / 15
