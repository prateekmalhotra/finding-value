**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit's management is actively investing in new product development and platform enhancements. Their strategy includes reinventing search, personalizing content recommendations through AI, and growing their international user base with features like machine translation. The company is also building out its "user economy" with initiatives like the Contributor Program and the Developer Platform to create new monetization channels. These efforts demonstrate a clear commitment to evolving the platform and expanding its revenue streams beyond advertising.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Research and development expenses were a significant portion of Reddit's total costs and expenses, at $935.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. This investment has resulted in tangible product improvements, such as AI-powered content recommendations and a revamped search experience. The company's continued user growth and recent profitability suggest that these R&D investments are yielding positive results.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit's revenue has been growing rapidly, with a 78% year-over-year increase in Q2 2025, driven primarily by advertising. The company is diversifying its advertiser base from large U.S. advertisers to mid-sized, smaller, and international businesses. This growth indicates an effective sales organization that is successfully capturing a greater share of the digital advertising market.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000196/rddt-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000196/rddt-20250630.htm) (July 31, 2025), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit has recently achieved profitability, reporting net income of $89.3 million in Q2 2025, a significant improvement from a net loss of $10.1 million in the same period of the prior year. The company's gross margin has also improved, reaching 90.8% in Q2 2025, up from 89.5% in Q2 2024. This indicates a strong potential for sustained profitability as the company continues to scale its operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000196/rddt-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000196/rddt-20250630.htm) (July 31, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit is focused on scaling its revenue faster than its costs. The company is achieving this through a combination of growing its user base, increasing advertiser demand, and exploring new high-margin revenue streams like data licensing. Additionally, the company is leveraging its proprietary technology and AI to improve operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit's filings emphasize the importance of its corporate culture and its ability to attract and retain high-quality personnel. The company offers a flexible work policy and has established Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) to foster a sense of belonging among its employees. However, the "Risk Factors" section also notes that reductions in the workforce could negatively impact employee morale. Without more direct evidence of employee satisfaction, a definitive "Yes" is not possible.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The senior management team, including co-founder and CEO Steven Huffman, has been instrumental in the company's growth and strategic direction. The filings do not indicate any significant executive turnover or internal conflicts. However, the concentration of voting control with Mr. Huffman and the governance agreement with Advance could be a point of contention in the future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit has a well-defined senior management team with a Chief Operating Officer, Chief Financial Officer, and other key executives who are actively involved in the company's strategic initiatives. The filings indicate a clear division of responsibilities and a team that is capable of managing a growing global business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344524000054/rddt-20240630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344524000054/rddt-20240630.htm) (August 6, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly-traded company, Reddit is subject to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which mandates strong internal controls over financial reporting. The company's filings are audited by a major accounting firm, and there are no reported material weaknesses in its internal controls. This indicates a high level of accounting and cost control.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit's key differentiator is its vast network of over 100,000 active communities, which creates a powerful network effect. This user-driven content engine makes the platform a unique and constantly evolving "human archive of information," a valuable asset for both users and AI development. This community-based model fosters a high level of user trust and engagement that is difficult for competitors to replicate.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Reddit has historically prioritized user growth and product development over short-term profitability, as evidenced by its history of net losses. The company's continued investments in international expansion, AI, and new products demonstrate a long-term strategic focus. While the company has recently achieved profitability, its investment strategy remains geared towards long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As of June 30, 2025, Reddit had $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The company also has access to a $500.0 million revolving credit facility and is generating positive cash flow from operations. This strong financial position should be sufficient to fund its growth initiatives without the need for significant equity financing in the near future.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000196/rddt-20250630.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000196/rddt-20250630.htm) (July 31, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a relatively new public company, Reddit's track record of investor communication is still developing. However, its quarterly earnings calls and SEC filings provide a detailed overview of its business, including risks and challenges. The "Risk Factors" section of its 10-K is comprehensive and transparent about the potential threats to the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no reported legal or regulatory actions against Reddit's management that would bring their integrity into question. However, the company is subject to a non-public inquiry from the FTC regarding its data licensing practices. While this does not imply wrongdoing, it does represent a level of regulatory scrutiny that prevents a definitive "Yes."
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1713445/000171344525000018/rddt-20241231.htm) (February 12, 2025)

---
**Synthesis:**
Reddit scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and strong financial position. The company's unique community-based platform provides a significant competitive advantage, and its recent move to profitability is a positive sign. The two "No" answers are primarily due to a lack of sufficient evidence in the case of labor relations and the presence of a regulatory inquiry in the case of management integrity. The most likely variables to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the outcome of the FTC inquiry, the company's ability to maintain its positive employee relations as it grows, and the continued success of its new monetization strategies. A resolution of the FTC inquiry without any adverse findings would likely flip that point to a "Yes," and more positive disclosures about employee satisfaction could do the same for labor relations.

**fisher score is 13 / 15**
