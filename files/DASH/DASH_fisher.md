The company's 2024 10-K filing outlines its strategy to provide merchants with "an expanding suite of services that help them build and grow successful omnichannel businesses." This focus on building a comprehensive local commerce platform, including advertising solutions and merchant tools, shows a clear determination to develop new revenue streams beyond its core marketplace.
**Answer:** Yes

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?

The company states it is focused on developing new platform features, improving logistics technology, and enhancing its mobile applications.

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's ability to consistently grow its merchant base and Total Orders indicates an effective sales and marketing function. Total Orders grew 20% year-over-year to 2.6 billion in 2024. DoorDash's strategy involves attracting merchants by providing a suite of services including customer acquisition, demand fulfillment, and advertising. The company served over 42 million monthly active users and had over 22 million members in its DashPass and Wolt+ subscription programs as of December 31, 2024, demonstrating its effectiveness at attracting and retaining a large user base that drives sales for its merchants.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash achieved its first full year of GAAP net income in 2024, reporting $123 million. The company's GAAP gross margin was 46.4% in 2024, an improvement from 44.7% in 2023. While the company has historically operated at a net loss to fuel growth, the recent turn to profitability and improving gross margins are positive signs. The company also tracks non-GAAP measures like Contribution Profit, which was $3.5 billion (32.4% Contribution Margin) in 2024, indicating the underlying economics of its orders are healthy. The profit margin is still nascent but trending in the right direction.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash is focused on improving margins through several initiatives. These include enhancing logistical efficiency through better routing and batching algorithms, which helps manage Dasher-related costs. The company is also growing higher-margin revenue streams, such as advertising, which contributed to a Net Revenue Margin improvement from 12.9% in 2023 to 13.4% in 2024. Additionally, the company is focused on operational expense discipline as it scales. The improvement in gross margin and the increase in Adjusted EBITDA from $1.2 billion in 2023 to $1.9 billion in 2024 reflect these efforts.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a gig-economy platform, DoorDash's relationship with its independent contractor Dashers is complex and a significant area of risk. The company faces numerous legal and regulatory challenges regarding worker classification. In its 2024 10-K, the company cites these challenges as a major risk factor. While DoorDash states it aims to make dashing an "accessible, flexible, and supportive" earnings opportunity, the persistent litigation and regulatory scrutiny in jurisdictions like California (Proposition 22) and an EU directive on platform work indicate that relations are contentious rather than outstanding. The company had over 23,700 employees as of December 31, 2024, and believes its employee relations are strong. However, the primary labor force is Dashers, where relations are strained.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 8) Executive Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company is led by its co-founder, Tony Xu, who serves as CEO and Chair of the board, indicating stability at the highest level. The co-founders, Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang, maintain significant voting control through a multi-class stock structure and a voting agreement, suggesting a unified direction. There is no public evidence of significant executive turnover or infighting. The continued presence and active roles of the co-founders suggest stable executive relations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 9) Depth of Management

**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash has a publicly listed executive team beyond the CEO, including leaders for its international operations (Wolt), finance, and technology. The 2024 10-K and proxy statements list a full C-suite and key operational leaders. The acquisition of Wolt in 2022 also brought in an experienced international management team. While the co-founders hold significant control and key roles, the company has built out a broader leadership team to manage its growing global operations.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a publicly traded company, DoorDash is subject to Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements and its financial statements are audited by a major accounting firm, KPMG LLP. The auditor's report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, provides an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. The company provides detailed breakdowns of its costs and non-GAAP metrics like Contribution Profit, suggesting a granular approach to cost analysis. There is no recent history of material weaknesses or financial restatements.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The key competitive advantages in this industry are network effects and logistical efficiency. DoorDash has built a strong three-sided marketplace (merchants, consumers, Dashers) that creates powerful local network effects; more consumers attract more merchants, which in turn attracts more Dashers. The company's large and growing base of 42 million monthly active users and 22 million subscription members as of year-end 2024 indicates a leading position. Its focus on logistical technology to optimize routing and batching is critical for efficiency and a key differentiator.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash has consistently prioritized growth and market expansion over short-term profitability, as evidenced by its history of net losses while investing heavily in new markets, new verticals, and technology. The company’s 2024 10-K states its intent to "invest significant additional funds towards growing our business" and highlights its strategy of providing an "expanding suite of services". While the company achieved GAAP profitability in 2024, earnings call transcripts consistently emphasize investing for the long term to capture the large market opportunity in local commerce.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/DASH/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/DASH/transcripts/) (2024-2025)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash has a strong balance sheet. As of December 31, 2024, the company had $6.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and no significant debt. The company generated $1.8 billion in Free Cash Flow in 2024, demonstrating its ability to fund operations and investments internally. Furthermore, in February 2024, the company announced a share repurchase program of up to $1.1 billion, signaling confidence in its financial position and a commitment to returning capital to shareholders, not diluting them.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** DoorDash management communicates regularly with investors through quarterly earnings calls, shareholder letters, and SEC filings. The "Risk Factors" section of its 10-K is extensive and transparent about the numerous challenges it faces, including intense competition, the risk of reclassification of Dashers, and potential regulatory hurdles. A review of earnings call transcripts shows management addressing difficult questions from analysts regarding competition, regulation, and profitability.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/DASH/transcripts/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/DASH/transcripts/) (2024-2025)

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has faced legal and regulatory scrutiny, particularly concerning its Dasher pay models, worker classification, and consumer fees. The 2024 10-K discloses a number of legal proceedings, including an action by the San Francisco District Attorney regarding alleged misclassification of Dashers. While legal challenges are common in the gig economy, the volume and nature of these disputes, particularly those alleging violations of labor and consumer protection laws, prevent a conclusion of "unquestionable" integrity. There are no allegations of fraud or self-dealing by top executives, but the business model itself is subject to significant legal and ethical debate.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000162828025005715/dash-20241231.htm) (February 14, 2025)

**Synthesis**

DoorDash scores well on Fisher's checklist, particularly in areas related to market potential, innovation, financial strength, and management stability. The company's strongest positives are its massive growth runway as it expands into new verticals and geographies, its powerful network effects, and a solid balance sheet that now includes positive free cash flow and GAAP profitability. The primary negatives and risks revolve around its labor model and the associated legal and regulatory battles, which also impact the perception of management's integrity. The two most critical variables that could change the score in the next 12–24 months are regulatory decisions on worker classification in key markets and the company's ability to sustain and grow its profitability as it continues to invest heavily in expansion. A definitive legal framework that settles the independent contractor debate (even if it increases costs) would remove a major overhang and could flip the "Labor Relations" and "Integrity" points from No to Yes, significantly improving its score.

**Fisher Score is 13 / 15**
