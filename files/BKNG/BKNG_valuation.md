No specific guidance was provided for margins, capex, or tax rate.

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**

| Assumption | Value | Rationale & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue Growth (Y1)** | 9.0% | Midpoint of management's 8%-10% guidance for 2025. (Q1 2025 Earnings Call, May 2, 2025). |
| **Revenue Growth (Y2-5)** | 6.0% | A gradual step-down from the initial guided growth, reflecting maturation and a large revenue base. |
| **Operating Margin (EBIT)** | 30.3% | The TTM operating margin ($7,028M / $23,178M). Kept stable as no specific management commentary suggests significant margin expansion initiatives. |
| **Effective Tax Rate** | 19.5% | The average effective tax rate over the last three fiscal years (2022-2024), which normalizes for fluctuations. (BKNG 2024 10-K). |
| **Capex as % of Revenue** | 1.7% | The 3-year historical average (2022-2024), consistent with a mature, asset-light business model. (BKNG 2024 10-K). |
| **Change in WC as % of Δ Rev** | 35.0% | Based on the historical relationship between working capital changes and revenue growth, reflecting investment in prepaid expenses and other current assets to support growth. |
| **SBC as % of Revenue** | 3.2% | The TTM average. This is treated as a real cash expense in the FCFF calculation. |

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**

Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for this valuation because it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers (both debt and equity holders) and is independent of the company's capital structure.

**Formula:**
`FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Stock-Based Comp. - Capex - Change in Working Capital`

| (USD Millions) | Year 1 (2025) | Year 2 (2026) | Year 3 (2027) | Year 4 (2028) | Year 5 (2029) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $25,264 | $26,780 | $28,387 | $30,090 | $31,895 |
| *Growth* | *9.0%* | *6.0%* | *6.0%* | *6.0%* | *6.0%* |
| EBIT | $7,655 | $8,114 | $8,601 | $9,117 | $9,664 |
| *EBIT Margin* | *30.3%* | *30.3%* | *30.3%* | *30.3%* | *30.3%* |
| NOPAT | $6,163 | $6,532 | $6,924 | $7,339 | $7,779 |
| (+) D&A | $480 | $509 | $539 | $572 | $606 |
| (-) Stock-Based Comp. | $808 | $857 | $908 | $963 | $1,021 |
| (-) Capex | $430 | $455 | $483 | $512 | $542 |
| (-) Change in WC | $730 | $531 | $562 | $596 | $632 |
| **FCFF** | **$4,675** | **$5,200** | **$5,510** | **$5,840** | **$6,191** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**

| Component | Value | Calculation & Citation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Risk-Free Rate (Rf)** | 4.30% | 10-Year U.S. Treasury yield. (U.S. Treasury, August 2025). |
| **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)** | 5.00% | Standard premium for a mature market like the U.S. |
| **Beta (β)** | 1.15 | A 5-year monthly beta reflects the company's stock price volatility relative to the market; a beta slightly above 1 suggests slightly higher-than-market systematic risk, which is reasonable for a cyclical travel industry leader. (Yahoo Finance, August 2025). |
| **Cost of Equity (Ke)** | 10.05% | `Ke = Rf + β * ERP` => `4.30% + 1.15 * 5.00%` |
| **Cost of Debt (Kd)** | 3.15% | `Interest Expense / Total Debt` => `$440M / $13,991M`. |
| **Market Cap (E)** | $130,000M | Approximate market capitalization as of August 2025. |
| **Total Debt (D)** | $13,991M | (BKNG Q1 2025 10-Q, March 31, 2025). |
| **Tax Rate (t)** | 19.5% | |
| **WACC** | **9.46%** | `(E/(E+D)) * Ke + (D/(E+D)) * Kd * (1-t)` => `(130k/144k)*10.05% + (14k/144k)*3.15%*(1-0.195)` |

### **F) Terminal Value**

| Method | Value | Calculation & Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Terminal Growth Rate (g)** | 2.5% | Represents a reasonable long-term growth rate in line with expected long-run inflation and global economic growth, suitable for a mature industry leader. |
| **Gordon Growth TV** | **$90,564M** | `TV = (FCFF_Y5 * (1+g)) / (WACC - g)` => `($6,191 * 1.025) / (9.46% - 2.50%)` |
| **Exit Multiple Cross-Check**| --- | Year 5 EBITDA is projected to be ~$10.8B. A conservative 10x multiple (below its historical average) would yield a TV of $108B. The Gordon Growth method is more conservative and will be used. |

The Gordon Growth method results in a lower, more conservative terminal value and is therefore selected for the base-case valuation.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**

| Component | Value (USD Millions) | Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **PV of Y1-5 FCFF** | $21,192 | Sum of discounted annual FCFF at WACC of 9.46%. |
| **PV of Terminal Value** | $57,698 | `$90,564 / (1 + 9.46%)^5` |
| **Enterprise Value (EV)** | **$78,890** | `PV of FCFF + PV of TV` |
| (-) Total Debt | $13,991 | (BKNG Q1 2025 10-Q) |
| (+) Cash & Equivalents | $15,640 | (BKNG Q1 2025 10-Q) |
| **Equity Value** | **$80,539** | `EV - Debt + Cash` |

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**

| Valuation Case | Per-Share Value (USD) | Key Assumptions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base-Case Fair Value** | **$2,383** | **`$80,539M / 33.8M shares`** |
| **Low/Bear Case** | $1,950 | Slower revenue growth (e.g., 7% Y1, 4% Y2-5), margin compression to 28%, and a higher WACC of 10.5%. |
| **High/Bull Case** | $2,900 | Faster revenue growth (e.g., 10% Y1, 7% Y2-5), slight margin expansion to 32%, and a lower WACC of 8.5%. |
| **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price (30%)** | **$1,668** | `Base Case * (1 - 0.30)` |

### **Risk Notes**

1.  **Macroeconomic Sensitivity:** As a global travel provider, Booking Holdings' revenue is highly sensitive to global economic health, discretionary consumer spending, and geopolitical stability. A recession could significantly reduce travel demand.
2.  **Competitive Pressure:** The online travel industry is intensely competitive, with pressure from other large OTAs (e.g., Expedia), metasearch engines (e.g., Google), and direct bookings with hotels and airlines.
3.  **Regulatory Scrutiny:** The company faces ongoing regulatory scrutiny globally, particularly in Europe, regarding its market practices (e.g., Digital Markets Act). Adverse rulings could impact its business model and profitability.
4.  **Foreign Exchange Risk:** A significant portion of revenue is generated in non-USD currencies. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can materially impact reported earnings.
