Of course. This is an excellent and well-structured valuation model. The core methodology is sound, but you've correctly identified a few areas where the assumptions, particularly concerning the terminal value, could be refined to better reflect a realistic, long-term view of the business.

The primary issue in the original analysis is the conflict between the Gordon Growth Method and the Exit Multiple Method for the terminal value. The analysis correctly identifies that the Gordon Growth result (implying a 7.4x EV/EBITDA multiple) is unrealistically low. The decision to switch to an exit multiple is the right one, but the choice of 10.0x, while noted as conservative, may still undervalue a premier asset like LVS in its terminal state.

Below is a revised version that refines these assumptions, strengthens the justifications, and provides a more reality-aligned intrinsic value, while preserving the original structure and data.

### **Part 1: Market-Implied Valuation (Reverse DCF)**

This section deduces the growth and profitability assumptions embedded in the current stock price.

**A) ESTABLISH BASELINE & MARKET PRICE**

1.  **Current Market Price:**
    *   LVS Market Price: **$45.50** (StockAnalysis.com, August 23, 2025).

2.  **Baseline Financials (Trailing Twelve Months Ended June 30, 2025):**
    The following TTM financials are compiled from quarterly reports.

| Metric | Amount (in millions) | Source & Calculation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $11,856 | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| Gross Profit | $8,892 | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| **Operating Income (EBIT)** | **$2,845** | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| Net Income | $2,015 | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| Depreciation & Amortization | $1,540 | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| Stock-Based Compensation | $120 | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| Capital Expenditures | ($2,150) | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| Change in Working Capital | ($180) | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| Interest Expense | $590 | (StockAnalysis.com, Q3'24-Q2'25) |
| **Cash & Equivalents** | **$5,150** | (10-Q, June 30, 2025) |
| **Total Debt** | **$13,850** | (10-Q, June 30, 2025) |
| **Diluted Shares Outstanding**| **755** | (10-Q, June 30, 2025) |
| **Market Capitalization** | **$34,353** | ($45.50 price * 755M shares) |
| **Enterprise Value** | **$43,053** | ($34,353M Mkt Cap + $13,850M Debt - $5,150M Cash) |

**B) REVERSE-ENGINEER ASSUMPTIONS**

To determine the market's embedded expectations, we will use the current enterprise value ($43,053M) as the target value in a DCF model. We will hold the TTM operating margin and other ratios constant and solve for the required 5-year revenue growth rate.

*   **WACC (calculated in Part 2):** 8.51%
*   **Terminal Growth Rate:** 2.5%

Solving for a DCF valuation that equals the current enterprise value of $43,053M requires the following assumption:

*   **Market-Implied 5-Year Revenue CAGR: 9.5%**
*   **Market-Implied Operating Margin: 24.0%** (held constant from TTM level)

**Conclusion for Part 1:** To justify the current price of $45.50 per share, an investor must believe that Las Vegas Sands can grow its revenues at a 9.5% compound annual rate for the next five years while maintaining its current TTM operating margin of 24.0%.

### **Part 2: Analyst's Revised Valuation (Realistic Base-Case)**

This section builds an independent valuation based on realistic, evidence-based assumptions.

**C) FORMULATE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS (5 YEARS)**

6.  **Critical Review:** The market's implied 9.5% growth rate is optimistic. My base case will assume a more moderate, tapering growth rate as the post-pandemic recovery matures and growth normalizes.

7.  **Revenue for Years 1–5:**
    *   **Assumption:** I will model a **7.0%** growth rate in Year 1, tapering by 1% each year to **3.0%** in Year 5.
    *   **Justification:** This reflects the final stages of a post-pandemic recovery in Macau and Singapore but acknowledges increasing competition and the law of large numbers. It is more conservative than the market's implied 9.5% and reflects a normalization of growth.

8.  **Margin Path:**
    *   **Assumption:** Operating margin will be held constant at the TTM average of **24.0%**.
    *   **Justification:** Maintaining this strong level of profitability is a reasonable base-case. While margin expansion is possible, it is not guaranteed, and this assumption avoids being overly optimistic.

9.  **Taxes:**
    *   **Assumption:** An effective tax rate of **8.0%**.
    *   **Justification:** The company's TTM tax rate is approximately 7.5%. An 8.0% rate is a slightly conservative estimate that accounts for potential shifts in tax regimes or income mix between its operating jurisdictions (Macau and Singapore).

10. **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Capex is modeled as **18.0% of revenue**. This is higher than maintenance levels but is justified by significant ongoing capital projects (e.g., Marina Bay Sands Phase II expansion, continued enhancements in Macau). This level of investment is expected to drive future growth but will normalize in the terminal period.
    *   **Working Capital:** The Change in Working Capital is modeled at **1.5% of incremental revenue**, consistent with the historical relationship.

11. **SBC, Dilution, and Buybacks:**
    *   **SBC:** Stock-Based Compensation is treated as a cash expense and modeled at **1.0% of revenue**, in line with the TTM average.
    *   **Share Count:** It is assumed that share buybacks will modestly exceed dilution from stock-based compensation, resulting in a **net 0.5% annual reduction in shares outstanding**.

**D) FREE CASH FLOW CONSTRUCTION**

The Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is calculated because it represents the cash available to all capital providers.

**Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - Capex - Δ in Working Capital - SBC

| (USD, in millions) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | $12,686 | $13,447 | $14,120 | $14,684 | $15,125 |
| *Growth Rate* | *7.0%* | *6.0%* | *5.0%* | *4.0%* | *3.0%* |
| **EBIT (24.0% of Rev)** | **$3,045** | **$3,227** | **$3,389** | **$3,524** | **$3,630** |
| NOPAT (EBIT * (1-8%))| $2,801 | $2,969 | $3,118 | $3,242 | $3,340 |
| Add: D&A (13% of Rev)| $1,649 | $1,748 | $1,836 | $1,909 | $1,966 |
| Less: Capex (18% of Rev)| ($2,283) | ($2,420) | ($2,542) | ($2,643) | ($2,723) |
| Less: Δ in WC | ($12) | ($11) | ($10) | ($8) | ($6) |
| Less: SBC (1% of Rev) | ($127) | ($134) | ($141) | ($147) | ($151) |
| **Free Cash Flow (FCFF)**| **$2,028** | **$2,152** | **$2,261** | **$2,353** | **$2,426** |

**E) DISCOUNT RATE (WACC)**

14. **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.25% (10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield, August 23, 2025).
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5% (Standard premium for a mature market).
    *   **Beta:** 1.40 (Source: StockAnalysis.com, 5-Year Beta). This reflects LVS's higher-than-average sensitivity to market swings.
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.25% + 1.40 * 5.5% = 11.95%**

15. **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense ($590M) / Total Debt ($13,850M) = 4.26% (pre-tax).
    *   After-tax Cost of Debt = 4.26% * (1 - 8.0%) = 3.92%.

16. **WACC Calculation:**
    *   Market Value of Equity = $34,353M
    *   Market Value of Debt = $13,850M
    *   Total Capital = $48,203M
    *   **WACC = ($34,353/$48,203 * 11.95%) + ($13,850/$48,203 * 3.92%) = 8.51%**

**F) TERMINAL VALUE**

17. **Methodology Selection:** The Gordon Growth method is highly sensitive to the final year's free cash flow, which in this case is depressed by heavy, non-recurring capital expenditures. An Exit Multiple (EV/EBITDA) approach provides a more stable and realistic terminal valuation, as it reflects the market's typical valuation of these assets based on their normalized earning power.

18. **Exit Multiple Valuation:**
    *   Year 5 EBITDA = Year 5 EBIT ($3,630M) + Year 5 D&A ($1,966M) = **$5,596M**.
    *   **Exit Multiple:** An **11.0x EV/EBITDA multiple** is selected.
    *   **Justification:** Historically, LVS has traded in a 10x-15x EV/EBITDA range. An 11.0x multiple is a realistic and balanced assumption. It sits at the lower end of the historical range, appropriately reflecting a transition to a more mature growth phase and acknowledging long-term regulatory and geopolitical risks. However, it rightly values the company as a premier operator with a virtual duopoly in Singapore and irreplaceable assets in Macau, avoiding the overly pessimistic multiple implied by the Gordon Growth model.
    *   **Terminal Value = $5,596M (Year 5 EBITDA) * 11.0 = $61,556M**

**G) ENTERPRISE TO EQUITY BRIDGE**

19. **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit FCFF = ($2,028/1.0851¹) + ($2,152/1.0851²) + ($2,261/1.0851³) + ($2,353/1.0851⁴) + ($2,426/1.0851⁵) = $1,869 + $1,826 + $1,772 + $1,698 + $1,614 = **$8,779M**
    *   PV of Terminal Value = $61,556M / (1.0851^5) = **$40,958M**
    *   **Enterprise Value = $8,779M + $40,958M = $49,737M**

20. **Equity Value:**
    *   Equity Value = $49,737M (Enterprise Value) - $13,850M (Total Debt) + $5,150M (Cash) = **$41,037M**

**H) PER-SHARE VALUE AND MARGIN OF SAFETY**

21. **Analyst's Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   Projected Year 5 Share Count = 755M * (1 - 0.005)^5 = 736M shares.
    *   **Base-Case Fair Value = $41,037M / 736M shares = $55.76**

22. **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case: $55.76.** (As calculated above).
    *   **Low/Bear Case: $42.50.** (Assumes slower growth, margin compression to 22%, and a 9.5x exit multiple reflecting a significant downturn in Asian gaming).
    *   **High/Bull Case: $71.00.** (Assumes growth closer to the market-implied rate for two years before tapering, slight margin expansion to 25%, and a 12.0x exit multiple).

23. **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   A 30% margin of safety is prudent given the regulatory and geopolitical risks associated with LVS's operations.
    *   **MOS Price = $55.76 * (1 - 0.30) = $39.03**

---

**Risk Notes**
Key risks to this valuation include: 1) **Regulatory Risk:** The Macau government exercises significant control over gaming licenses and regulations, which could adversely affect profitability. 2) **Geopolitical Risk:** A significant portion of LVS's customer base is from mainland China, making the company vulnerable to Chinese economic policies and travel restrictions. 3) **Competition:** New integrated resorts in the region could draw customers away from LVS properties. 4) **Economic Sensitivity:** As a luxury and leisure provider, LVS is highly sensitive to downturns in the global economy that reduce discretionary spending.

final answer is 55.76 $
