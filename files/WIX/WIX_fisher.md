Synthesis: The analysis indicates that Wix has a strong product offering with a long runway for growth and a good understanding of its competitive landscape. However, there is a significant lack of available information in the provided search results to make a definitive judgment on many of Fisher's points, including R&D effectiveness, profit margins, and various aspects of management and investor relations. The score would most likely change in the next 12–24 months with the release of more detailed financial reports, investor presentations that address margin improvement and long-term profit outlook, and more visibility into the company's R&D and sales strategies. To flip the "No" answers to "Yes," evidence of market-beating R&D efficiency, clear and improving profit margins, detailed succession plans, and a track record of transparent communication during challenging periods would be required.

fisher score is 3 / 15
