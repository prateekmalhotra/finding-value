**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**  
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday demonstrates a strong commitment to new product development, particularly in artificial intelligence. The company's strategy is heavily focused on embedding AI across its entire product suite, acquiring AI-native companies like Paradox and Flowise, and launching the "Workday Illuminate" AI platform. This AI-first strategy is a core growth engine, with over 75% of new deals in Q2 2026 including an AI solution. Management has clearly articulated a forward-looking strategy centered on innovation in AI, international expansion, and its partner ecosystem.

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**  
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday sustains a high level of R&D investment, reported at $2.626 billion for fiscal year 2025 and representing approximately 19% of revenue in Q2 2025. The effectiveness of this spending is demonstrated by rapid innovation in high-demand areas like AI, where net new annual contract value (ACV) from AI products more than doubled year-over-year in Q2 2026. This focus on incorporating AI and ML capabilities across its platform appears to be a key differentiator and driver of new business, suggesting R&D is highly effective and aligned with market trends.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**  
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday's sales effectiveness is demonstrated by its penetration of large enterprises, with over 60% of the Fortune 500 as customers. The company consistently reports strong win rates and success in selling its full suite of applications. Its 12-month subscription revenue backlog was $6.60 billion as of April 30, 2024, up 17.9% year-over-year, providing strong visibility into future revenue. The company is also successfully leveraging its partner ecosystem, which contributed over 20% of net new ACV for two consecutive quarters in FY2026.

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**  
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Yes, Workday has achieved strong and expanding non-GAAP operating margins. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, the non-GAAP operating margin was 25.9%. For the first quarter of fiscal 2025, the non-GAAP operating margin was also a healthy 25.9%, up from 23.5% in the prior-year period. The company has raised its full-year non-GAAP operating margin guidance, indicating confidence in its profitability.

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**  
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is explicitly focused on driving efficiencies to improve margins. CEO Carl Eschenbach has stated a focus on "long-term, durable growth" and CFO Zane Rowe noted "increasing our margin outlook as we focus on driving increased efficiencies across the company." This is reflected in their guidance, where they raised their non-GAAP operating margin target to 25.25% for FY25 and project it to reach 30% by FY27. In February 2025, the company also initiated a restructuring plan to reduce its workforce by approximately 8% to prioritize investments and advance its focus on durable growth.  
**Answer:** Yes

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday is frequently cited as a top workplace, which is a positive indicator. However, in February 2025, the company announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce its workforce by approximately 8% to prioritize investments. While layoffs are common in the tech sector for strategic realignment, they can negatively impact morale. There is no verifiable, recent data on employee attrition or engagement metrics available in the provided sources to make a definitive assessment. Given the recent significant workforce reduction, it is difficult to confirm "outstanding" relations without more evidence.  
**Answer:** No

**8) Executive Relations**  
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team, including CEO Carl Eschenbach and CFO Zane Rowe, appears stable and presents a unified strategy during public announcements and financial result reporting. There is no public information available from the search results regarding executive turnover, board stability, or internal conflicts. The consistent messaging and strategic alignment on key initiatives like AI and margin expansion suggest a functional and collaborative executive team.

**9) Depth of Management**  
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday has a visible and tenured executive team beyond the CEO and CFO. The company's announcements and presentations feature leaders like Co-President Doug Robinson and Chief Product Officer David Somers, indicating a breadth of leadership across key functions. The creation of Workday Government, a new subsidiary, also suggests the company is developing leaders with specialized, segment-specific expertise. This structure points to a distributed leadership model rather than a dependency on one or two key individuals.  
**Answer:** Yes

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**  
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday operates as a public company subject to the regulations of the U.S. SEC, which includes stringent requirements for accounting and internal controls. There are no mentions of restatements, auditor issues, or material weaknesses in the browsed materials. The company provides detailed financial reporting, including breakdowns of subscription and professional services revenue, as well as GAAP and non-GAAP reconciliations, suggesting robust controls.

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**  
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the SaaS ERP industry, high switching costs and ecosystem lock-in are key competitive advantages. Workday’s unified, cloud-native platform for both HR and financials creates a "sticky" customer relationship, as managing these core functions in one system is highly valuable. The company's gross revenue retention rate of approximately 97% is a strong indicator of customer satisfaction and the platform's stickiness. Furthermore, its aggressive and effective push into AI, with high attach rates for new AI products, serves as a significant differentiator against legacy competitors.  
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**  
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday's management consistently emphasizes a strategy of balancing growth with profitability for the long term. They make significant ongoing investments in high-growth areas like AI, international expansion, and their partner ecosystem, which are long-term initiatives. Simultaneously, they are taking steps, including restructuring, to drive operating leverage and have provided a multi-year path to margin expansion, targeting 30% non-GAAP operating margins by FY27. This dual focus demonstrates a commitment to durable, profitable growth rather than maximizing short-term earnings per share.

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**  
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Workday has a very strong financial position. As of April 30, 2024, the company held $7.18 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The business generates significant cash flow, with operating cash flows of $372 million in Q1 FY25. Instead of issuing equity, Workday is actively returning capital to shareholders, having repurchased $134 million of its Class A common stock in the same quarter. This strong balance sheet and cash generation ability negate the need for dilutive equity financing.  
**Answer:** Yes

**14) Candor with Investors**  
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management has demonstrated transparency in its communications. In the Q1 FY2025 earnings announcement, CFO Zane Rowe directly addressed challenges, stating, "Our updated subscription revenue guidance reflects the elevated sales scrutiny and lower customer headcount growth we experienced during the quarter." This willingness to openly discuss headwinds, while simultaneously highlighting strategic initiatives and raising margin guidance, is a hallmark of candid investor relations.  
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**  
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?  
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is no evidence in the provided sources of any significant legal issues, regulatory actions, or corporate governance scandals associated with Workday's management. The company is a leading enterprise software provider that serves over 60% of the Fortune 500, a customer base that requires a high degree of trust and integrity. The absence of red flags in public disclosures supports a positive assessment.  
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis**

Workday scores highly on the Fisher checklist, exhibiting the characteristics of a durable, long-term growth company. Its strongest positives are its large and expanding addressable market, a clear commitment to product leadership through effective R&D in AI, a strong sales organization evidenced by high-quality customer wins and backlog growth, and robust financials marked by expanding margins and a solid balance sheet. The management team communicates a clear, long-term strategy and has demonstrated candor with investors. The primary negative, or area of uncertainty, is in personnel relations following a significant workforce reduction; while strategically necessary, its impact on culture and talent retention warrants monitoring.

The two variables most likely to change the score in the next 12–24 months are the execution of its AI strategy and its ability to maintain margin expansion. Continued high attach rates for AI products and quantifiable efficiency gains for customers would reinforce the "Yes" for R&D effectiveness and competitive clues. Evidence that the February 2025 restructuring has successfully refocused the company without damaging morale or innovation, perhaps through improved employee engagement scores or lower-than-expected attrition, would be needed to flip the "No" on Labor Relations to a "Yes."

fisher score is 14 / 15
