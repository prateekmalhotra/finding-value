Primary Sources Reviewed: Form 10-K (July 27, 2024), Form 10-Q (April 26, 2025), Q3 FY2025 Earnings Call Transcript (May 14, 2025).

**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco is capitalizing on major secular trends in AI, cybersecurity, and hybrid work. The company secured over $2 billion in AI-related orders in fiscal 2025, doubling its initial target, driven by demand for its high-performance Ethernet and Nexus switches for AI data centers. The acquisition of Splunk accelerates Cisco's shift into the high-growth observability and security markets, contributing to a total Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) base that has reached $31.1 billion. This transition to a more predictable, software-driven model reduces reliance on cyclical hardware sales and addresses a rapidly expanding market.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco's R&D spending is substantial, amounting to $8.0 billion (14.8% of revenue) in fiscal 2024 and increasing to $2.3 billion (16.3% of revenue) in the third quarter of fiscal 2025. This investment has yielded tangible results, particularly in the AI infrastructure space where the company rapidly secured over $2 billion in orders, double its initial target for fiscal 2025. The integration of Splunk and the development of platforms like Hypershield and AI Defense showcase an effective translation of R&D into market-leading security solutions. While direct peer comparisons on R&D as a percentage of revenue are not readily available, the output in high-growth areas suggests effective capital allocation.

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco's sales performance indicates a highly effective organization. In Q3 FY2025, total product orders grew 20% year-over-year (9% excluding Splunk), demonstrating broad-based demand across all geographies. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, product orders from the crucial Service Provider and Cloud segment surged 49% year-over-year. Furthermore, the integration of Splunk's offerings into Cisco's vast sales channel has accelerated new customer acquisition for Splunk by 14% year-over-year, highlighting the sales team's ability to cross-sell complex new solutions effectively.
**Answer:** Yes

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco maintains strong profitability. For the fiscal year ended July 27, 2024, the company reported a total gross margin of 64.7% and an operating margin of 22.6%. In the third quarter of fiscal 2025, total gross margin was 65.6%. These margins are robust for a company with a significant hardware component and reflect a favorable shift toward higher-margin software and services, which is being accelerated by the Splunk acquisition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm) (July 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887725000033/csco-20250426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887725000033/csco-20250426.htm) (April 26, 2025), [https://www.ainvest.com/news/ciscos-ai-and-software-push-fuel-0-45-stock-rise-with-1-13b-volume-surge-as-recurring-revenue-hits-31-1b](https://www.ainvest.com/news/ciscos-ai-and-software-push-fuel-0-45-stock-rise-with-1-13b-volume-surge-as-recurring-revenue-hits-31-1b) (August 23, 2025)

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco's primary strategy for margin improvement is the shift in its business model toward software and subscriptions, which now account for 54% of total revenue. The Splunk acquisition is central to this, adding a significant high-margin, recurring software revenue stream. The company's fiscal 2024 10-K also cites "productivity benefits" and a favorable product mix as key drivers for a 2.0 percentage point increase in product gross margin. Additionally, Cisco has initiated restructuring plans to reallocate resources toward key growth areas, aiming to improve operational efficiency.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm) (July 27, 2024), [https://www.ainvest.com/news/cisco-systems-leverages-ai-infrastructure-orders-to-redefine-growth-trajectory](https://www.ainvest.com/news/cisco-systems-leverages-ai-infrastructure-orders-to-redefine-growth-trajectory) (August 22, 2025), [https://www.ainvest.com/news/ciscos-ai-and-software-push-fuel-0-45-stock-rise-with-1-13b-volume-surge-as-recurring-revenue-hits-31-1b](https://www.ainvest.com/news/ciscos-ai-and-software-push-fuel-0-45-stock-rise-with-1-13b-volume-surge-as-recurring-revenue-hits-31-1b) (August 23, 2025)

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco is consistently recognized for its positive work environment. It was ranked #2 on the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For in 2024 and has been recognized on every annual list since 1998. Third-party analysis from Great Place to Work shows 96% of employees consider Cisco a great place to work, compared to a 57% average at a typical U.S. company. Data aggregated from top review sites gives Cisco an employee rating of 84 out of 100, placing it in the 98th percentile of its industry peers. Despite recent restructuring and layoffs, the overwhelming evidence from multiple sources indicates outstanding personnel relations.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team shows stability and a history of orderly succession. Chuck Robbins has served as CEO since 2015 and Chair since 2017, providing consistent leadership for nearly a decade. The company's Corporate Governance guidelines state that the board has a formal process for succession planning, which is reviewed with the CEO. This was demonstrated in the smooth, 16-month formal process transitioning from prior CEO John Chambers to Chuck Robbins. The board is composed of a majority of independent directors and has a Lead Independent Director, ensuring proper oversight.
**Answer:** Yes

**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm) (July 27, 2024)

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco's accounting controls appear robust and effective. The company's independent auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, issued an unqualified opinion on both the consolidated financial statements and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the fiscal year ended July 27, 2024. Management's own report concluded that internal controls were effective as of that date. The financial statements provide detailed segment and product-level disclosures, indicating strong internal cost analysis capabilities. There is no recent history of major restatements or accounting scandals.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm) (July 27, 2024)

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco's primary competitive advantage is its massive installed base and the integration of security, observability, and now AI capabilities directly into the network fabric. This creates a powerful ecosystem with high switching costs. As networking becomes more software-defined, Cisco's ability to bundle security and analytics provides a significant advantage over point-solution competitors. The company's transition to a recurring revenue model, with an ARR of $31.1 billion, leverages this installed base to create a more stable and predictable business than traditional hardware-focused rivals.
**Answer:** Yes

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a clear long-range focus. The $27 billion Splunk acquisition significantly impacted near-term operating expenses and debt levels but strategically positions Cisco for long-term leadership in the high-growth cybersecurity and observability markets. In the Q3 FY2025 earnings call, management emphasized their focus on disciplined integration and achieving cost synergies from the Splunk deal over the long run, while continuing to invest heavily in the AI opportunity. The consistent, rising investment in R&D, even during periods of demand softness, further underscores a willingness to prioritize long-term innovation over short-term profit maximization.
**Answer:** Yes

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Cisco's financial position is exceptionally strong. As of April 26, 2025, the company held $8.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents and $7.5 billion in investments. In the nine months ended April 26, 2025, it generated $10.0 billion in cash from operations. Cisco has a long-standing policy of returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, not issuing stock for financing. For fiscal year 2024, the company returned $12.2 billion to shareholders via $5.8 billion in stock repurchases and $6.4 billion in dividends, actively reducing its share count.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm) (July 27, 2024), [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887725000033/csco-20250426.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887725000033/csco-20250426.htm) (April 26, 2025)

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management demonstrates a high degree of candor. In its fiscal 2024 10-K, the company was direct about the "decline in product demand resulting in a decrease of revenue as customers continued to scrutinize spend." During the Q3 FY2025 earnings call on May 14, 2025, CEO Chuck Robbins and CFO Scott Herren openly addressed the challenges of integrating Splunk and the cautious customer spending environment, while providing detailed explanations for their positive long-term outlook. They directly answered tough questions from analysts regarding order linearity and the macro environment, showing a willingness to discuss both headwinds and tailwinds.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm) (July 27, 2024), [https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CSCO/transcripts/2025/3/](https://discountingcashflows.com/company/CSCO/transcripts/2025/3/) (May 14, 2025)

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There are no indicators of significant integrity issues. The company's Form 10-K discloses routine legal proceedings, such as patent infringement cases and tax disputes, which are normal for a technology company of its size and scope. A search for news and regulatory filings reveals no major scandals, SEC investigations into executives, or significant governance red flags. The company has a clean audit opinion on its financial statements and internal controls, suggesting a culture of compliance and transparent reporting.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/858877/000085887724000017/csco-20240727.htm) (July 27, 2024)

---
Synthesis:
Cisco Systems scores exceptionally well against Fisher's 15 points, reflecting a mature, well-managed technology leader successfully navigating a major strategic pivot. The company's strongest positives are its aggressive and well-timed push into AI infrastructure and its transformative acquisition of Splunk, which creates a long runway for growth in high-margin software and security. This is supported by a robust financial position, a deep management team, and a shareholder-friendly capital return policy. The company's culture and employee relations are also a significant, though less tangible, asset. There are no glaring negatives, with every point earning a "Yes" based on current evidence.

Looking ahead 12–24 months, the variables most likely to impact this score revolve around execution. The first is the successful integration of Splunk and the realization of projected revenue and cost synergies; any stumbles here could weaken the outlook on margins and development effectiveness. The second is the sustainability of AI-related order growth and Cisco's ability to maintain its market position against competitors like Arista Networks in this space. Evidence of faltering Splunk integration (e.g., missed synergy targets, executive departures) or a material loss of market share in AI networking would be the primary factors that could flip some of these "Yes" answers to "No".

fisher score is 15 / 15
