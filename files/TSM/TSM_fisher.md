### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** There is insufficient public information in the provided sources to make a definitive judgment on the quality of labor relations. While the company's success implies a highly skilled and motivated workforce, details on attrition, engagement, or union relations are not available in the financial filings or earnings call transcripts. A news report from July 2025 noted the "exit of TSMC's star procurement VP raises industry eyebrows," but this is an isolated executive event and does not speak to broader employee relations. Without more comprehensive data from an ESG report or similar disclosure, this criterion cannot be confirmed.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.tsmc.com/english/investorRelations/quarterly_results](https://www.tsmc.com/english/investorRelations/quarterly_results) (2025-07-17)

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** TSMC's financial position is exceptionally strong, mitigating any foreseeable need for dilutive equity financing. The company ended Q2 2025 with a massive cash and marketable securities balance of $90 billion. It generates robust free cash flow, which, combined with its cash on hand and access to debt markets, is more than sufficient to fund its aggressive capital expenditure plans. The company's history is one of returning capital to shareholders via dividends rather than seeking it through equity offerings.
**Answer:** Yes

### 14) Candor with Investors
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** TSMC's management demonstrates a high degree of candor in its communications with investors. In the Q2 2025 earnings call, they were transparent about the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and the expected margin dilution from new overseas fabs, proactively quantifying the impact. They host regular, detailed earnings conference calls with extensive Q&A sessions, addressing analyst questions on complex topics ranging from technology roadmaps to geopolitical risks. This consistent and detailed communication in both good and challenging times indicates a culture of transparency.
**Answer:** Yes

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Based on publicly available information, TSMC's management is held in high regard and there are no significant red flags suggesting a lack of integrity. The company has a long history as a public entity with no major accounting scandals or regulatory issues cited in recent filings. The 2024 Form 20-F is filed in accordance with SEC regulations, and there is no evidence of governance issues, related-party transactions, or other breaches that would call management's integrity into question.
**Answer:** Yes

**Synthesis:**

TSMC scores exceptionally well against Fisher's framework, reflecting its dominant position as a technology leader with a strong financial profile and a long-term strategic outlook. The company's primary strengths are its clear technological runway driven by AI and HPC, its disciplined investment in R&D and capacity to maintain that lead, and its outstanding profitability. The only "No" score is for Labor & Personnel Relations, which is due to a lack of available data rather than negative evidence. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are geopolitical tensions, which could disrupt operations and customer relationships, and the operational execution of its overseas fab expansion, which could impact margins more than the guided 2-3%. A successful, on-schedule ramp of the Arizona fab would solidify the company's global position, while any significant delays or cost overruns could raise concerns about management's ability to execute its global strategy. The "No" on labor relations would flip to "Yes" with the publication of a detailed sustainability or ESG report showing metrics like employee turnover and engagement that are favorable compared to industry peers.

**fisher score is 14 / 15**
