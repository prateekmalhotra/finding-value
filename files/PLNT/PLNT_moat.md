---

**1) Network Effects**
**Reasoning:** Planet Fitness benefits from a localized scale effect rather than true network effects; a new member joining in one city does not inherently increase the service's value for a member in another. While the PF Black Card allows system-wide access, this is a scale advantage, not a network effect. The primary value proposition is individual access to a specific club, not interactions between members that enhance the platform.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's value proposition is centered on individual access to a welcoming, non-intimidating environment and high-quality equipment. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The PF Black Card provides reciprocal use of all Planet Fitness clubs, a feature that leverages the company's scale but doesn't create user-to-user value enhancement. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

**2) Switching Costs**
**Reasoning:** Switching costs are relatively low for members, who can typically cancel at any time, although some memberships may have a cancellation fee. The primary switching cost is behavioral—the hassle of joining a new gym and adjusting to a new environment. There is no significant technical, data, or contractual lock-in for the end consumer.
**Evidence:**
*   The company offers a "non-committal membership option" and members "may cancel their memberships at any time after giving proper notification." (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The business model relies on attracting and retaining members in a competitive environment where consumers can shift to other low-cost alternatives or at-home fitness options. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

**3) Cost Advantage / Unit Cost Leadership**
**Reasoning:** Planet Fitness demonstrates a significant cost advantage through its scale, which allows for favorable supplier contracts on equipment and a streamlined, low-overhead club model. This translates to a low price point for consumers ($15/month starting fee) that competitors find difficult to match profitably. The no-frills approach (no pools, classes, daycare) is central to maintaining this low-cost structure.
**Evidence:**
*   The company's scale provides "enhanced purchasing power and extended warranties with our fitness equipment and other suppliers." (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The club model avoids "non-essential amenities such as group exercise classes, pools, day care centers and juice bars," allowing for more space for equipment and lower operating costs. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The standard Classic Card membership starts at "$15 per month to new members," a price point significantly below the 2023 industry average of $65 per month. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

**4) Intangible Assets / Brand / IP**
**Reasoning:** The "Judgement Free Zone" is a powerful, nationally recognized brand that differentiates Planet Fitness from traditional gyms and appeals to a large, underserved segment of the population. This brand identity, supported by significant advertising spend, creates a strong intangible asset. The company owns numerous registered trademarks, including "Planet Fitness" and "Judgement Free Zone."
**Evidence:**
*   Planet Fitness has "among the highest aided and unaided brand awareness scores in the U.S. fitness industry," supported by a third-party consumer study. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The company owns registered trademarks for "Planet Fitness," "Judgement Free Zone," "Lunk Alarm," and "No Gymtimidation," among others, which are critical to its business. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The National Advertising Fund (NAF) and local franchisee advertising resulted in a combined spend of over $330 million in 2024, reinforcing the brand. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 4 / 5

**5) Distribution & Efficient Scale**
**Reasoning:** With 2,722 clubs, Planet Fitness has a dense physical network that creates a significant barrier to entry and makes the market unattractive for new large-scale competitors. This scale is self-reinforcing; the large club base funds a national advertising budget that would be prohibitive for a new entrant to match. Franchisees have committed to opening approximately 900 additional clubs, further solidifying this advantage.
**Evidence:**
*   As of December 31, 2024, the company had 2,722 clubs across all 50 states and several international markets. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   Franchisees have contractual obligations under signed area development agreements (ADAs) to open "approximately 900 additional clubs." (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The company believes it has the potential to grow its club base to over 5,000 clubs in the U.S. alone, indicating a long runway for increasing density. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 5 / 5

**6) Data Advantage**
**Reasoning:** While Planet Fitness collects significant member data through its club management system and mobile app (approximately 19.7 million members), there is limited evidence of a strong, proprietary feedback loop where this data generates a significant competitive advantage. The data is used for operational purposes like billing and tracking visits, but the company does not detail how it drives unique product improvements or personalization that locks in users.
**Evidence:**
*   The company uses a third-party hosted club management system to "track and analyze sales, membership statistics, cross-club utilization, member tenure, amenity usage, billing performance and demographic profiles by member." (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The mobile application offers a "more personalized experience through featured content" and tracks gym visits and workout activity, but the uniqueness of this data asset is not established as a primary competitive driver. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 2 / 5

**7) Ecosystem / Platform Effects**
**Reasoning:** Planet Fitness's business model is not a multi-sided platform and lacks a strong ecosystem effect. The "PF Perks" program, which provides discounts from third-party partners, is a minor value-add rather than a core ecosystem. There is no third-party developer adoption or complementary product marketplace that significantly enhances the value of the core service.
**Evidence:**
*   The PF Perks program offers "special discounts, promotions and offers from certain brands and third-party retail partners," but this is a secondary benefit, not an integrated ecosystem. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The business is focused on a direct-to-consumer service offering (gym access) and equipment sales to franchisees, not on building a third-party platform. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

**8) Regulatory / Legal Barriers**
**Reasoning:** The company operates in an industry with standard business regulations but no significant, proprietary legal barriers that would prevent competition. While franchising laws and consumer protection regulations apply, these are barriers to malpractice, not barriers to entry for a well-capitalized competitor. The company does not hold exclusive licenses or patents that block competitors from the market.
**Evidence:**
*   The company is subject to FTC Franchise Rules and state franchise laws, which are standard for the industry and do not provide a unique competitive advantage. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   Operations are subject to consumer protection regulations, health and safety laws, and data privacy laws, which apply broadly to competitors as well. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 1 / 5

**9) Capital Intensity & Asset Specificity**
**Reasoning:** Building a new fitness club requires significant capital expenditure for leasehold improvements and equipment, creating a moderate barrier to entry. While a franchisee-led model reduces the capital burden on PLNT's corporate balance sheet, the total system investment is substantial. The assets (fitness equipment, club build-outs) are specific to the industry, making it a deterrent for casual entrants.
**Evidence:**
*   The cost to build a new club includes "general contractor costs, the cost of fitness equipment... non-fitness equipment and leasehold improvements," which can vary significantly but represent a material upfront investment for franchisees. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The company's strategy to be "predominantly franchisee-owned enables us to scale more rapidly than a predominantly company-owned strategy," effectively leveraging franchisee capital to build out the network. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 3 / 5

**10) Customer Contracts & Revenue Visibility**
**Reasoning:** The business model is built on highly predictable, recurring revenue streams from monthly and annual membership fees. Approximately 90% of both corporate-owned club and franchise revenues are recurring. The use of Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) for the vast majority of collections adds to the reliability and visibility of future revenue.
**Evidence:**
*   In 2024, "approximately 90% of both our corporate-owned club and franchise revenues consisted of recurring revenue streams, which include royalties, monthly dues and annual fees." (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
*   The company utilizes "electronic funds transfer ('EFT') as our primary method of collecting monthly dues and annual membership fees," with approximately 82% of payments collected via ACH direct debit, which provides stability. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
**Score:** 5 / 5

**Aggregation**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    *   (2 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02)
    *   = 0.36 + 0.30 + 0.60 + 0.48 + 0.50 + 0.20 + 0.08 + 0.06 + 0.12 + 0.10
    *   = 2.80
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 28.0 / 100

**Mapping**
*   The weighted score of 28.0 falls into the threshold "10 ≤ Weighted < 30".
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 1.

*Correction: Let me re-calculate my weighted score. The sum is 2.8, which needs to be multiplied by 10 to be on a 100-point scale before applying the thresholds. 2.8 * 10 = 28. Let me re-read the scoring instructions to ensure I am interpreting this correctly. The weights are percentages, so 18% is 0.18. The scores are 0-5. The weighted contribution is score * weight. The sum of weighted contributions should be on a 5-point scale. So 2.8 is the final weighted score out of 5. Now I must convert this 0-5 score to a 0-100 score to use the thresholds.*

*Let's re-read the scoring instructions carefully: "Compute a **weighted score** = sum(score_dim \* weight_dim). Weights above are the default... Convert weighted score (0-100) to a 0–5 moat rating". This implies the weighted score should be on a 0-100 scale. Let me adjust my calculation. It seems I should multiply the score (0-5) by the weight (as a percentage number, e.g., 18).

Let's recalculate the weighted contribution based on this understanding:
1. Network Effects: 2 * 18 = 36
2. Switching Costs: 2 * 15 = 30
3. Cost Advantage: 4 * 15 = 60
4. Intangible Assets: 4 * 12 = 48
5. Distribution & Scale: 5 * 10 = 50
6. Data Advantage: 2 * 10 = 20
7. Ecosystem: 1 * 8 = 8
8. Regulatory Barriers: 1 * 6 = 6
9. Capital Intensity: 3 * 4 = 12
10. Customer Contracts: 5 * 2 = 10
Sum = 36 + 30 + 60 + 48 + 50 + 20 + 8 + 6 + 12 + 10 = 280.
The maximum score is 5 * 100 = 500. So a score of 280/500 is 56/100.
Let's review the table calculation again.
The sum of (raw score * weight %) is the final weighted score.
(2 * 18) + (2 * 15) + (4 * 15) + (4 * 12) + (5 * 10) + (2 * 10) + (1 * 8) + (1 * 6) + (3 * 4) + (5 * 2) = 280. This is a score out of a potential 500 (5 * 100). This seems incorrect.

Let's try another interpretation. Weighted score = sum(score_dim * weight_dim). The weights sum to 1.0 (100%). The scores are 0-5.
The calculation should be:
(2 * 0.18) + (2 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.15) + (4 * 0.12) + (5 * 0.10) + (2 * 0.10) + (1 * 0.08) + (1 * 0.06) + (3 * 0.04) + (5 * 0.02) = 2.8. This is a weighted average score on a 0-5 scale.
To convert this to a 0-100 scale, I should multiply by 20. So, 2.8 * 20 = 56.
This makes sense. A weighted average score of 2.8/5 is equivalent to 56/100.

**Aggregation (Corrected)**
*   **Weighted Score Calculation:**
    *   Network Effects: 2 * 18% = 0.36
    *   Switching Costs: 2 * 15% = 0.30
    *   Cost Advantage: 4 * 15% = 0.60
    *   Intangible Assets: 4 * 12% = 0.48
    *   Distribution & Scale: 5 * 10% = 0.50
    *   Data Advantage: 2 * 10% = 0.20
    *   Ecosystem: 1 * 8% = 0.08
    *   Regulatory Barriers: 1 * 6% = 0.06
    *   Capital Intensity: 3 * 4% = 0.12
    *   Customer Contracts: 5 * 2% = 0.10
*   **Sum of Weighted Contributions (0-5 scale):** 2.80
*   **Conversion to 0-100 scale:** 2.80 * 20 = 56.0
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 56.0 / 100

**Mapping (Corrected)**
*   The weighted score of 56.0 falls into the threshold "50 ≤ Weighted < 70".
*   This maps to a final moat rating of 3.

This seems much more reasonable and aligns with the qualitative assessment. I will now update the table and proceed with the rest of the analysis based on this score.

**Aggregation:**
*   **Weighted Sum Calculation:** The sum of each dimension's raw score multiplied by its weight percentage results in a weighted score of 2.80 out of 5.
*   **Final Weighted Numeric Score:** 56.0 / 100

**Mapping:**
*   The numeric weighted score of 56.0 falls within the 50-69 range.
*   **Final Moat Rating:** 3 / 5

**Moat Duration Justification:**
The moat is estimated to be durable for approximately 10-12 years. This durability is primarily rooted in the company's significant scale and strong brand identity, which are difficult and costly for competitors to replicate. The franchise model, with its standard 12-year agreement terms for new clubs, provides a long-term, stable footprint and predictable royalty streams that will continue to fund the national marketing that reinforces the brand.

**Top 3 Moat Erosion Scenarios:**
1.  **Shift in Consumer Preferences:** A significant shift away from the low-cost, no-frills gym model towards boutique fitness, at-home digital solutions, or the increased prevalence of weight loss medications could erode Planet Fitness's target market. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
2.  **Franchisee Distress:** A widespread economic downturn could strain franchisee finances, leading to underinvestment in club maintenance and remodels, slower new unit growth, and potential defaults, thereby degrading the brand experience and slowing growth. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)
3.  **Brand Damage:** A significant negative event related to member safety, data privacy, or franchisee relations that receives considerable negative publicity could rapidly damage the "Judgement Free Zone" brand, which is the company's core intangible asset. (10-K, Feb 25, 2025)

**KPIs to Monitor:**
*   **System-wide Same Club Sales:** A consistent decline below inflation would signal eroding pricing power or membership saturation.
*   **Net Member Growth:** Deceleration in net member additions per average club could indicate competitive pressure or market saturation.
*   **PF Black Card Penetration %:** Stagnation or decline in this metric could signal that the premium value proposition is weakening.
*   **Franchisee-owned New Club Openings:** A significant slowdown in the pace of franchisee expansion would be a leading indicator of weakening system health and growth prospects.
*   **Average Royalty Rate:** A stall in the growth of the average royalty rate could indicate difficulty in signing new or renewal agreements at the current 7% rate.
*   **Club-level Four-Wall EBITDA Margins:** Compression in franchisee or corporate club margins would signal rising costs or weakening pricing power.
*   **Brand Awareness Scores:** A decline in third-party brand health studies would be a direct measure of intangible asset erosion.
*   **Member Cancellation Rates:** A sustained increase in member churn would indicate a weakening of the value proposition and low switching costs.

**Short Verdict Paragraph:**
Planet Fitness has established a moderate moat, earning a rating of 3 out of 5. The moat's foundation rests on two key pillars: a strong, differentiated brand and significant efficient scale. The "Judgement Free Zone" branding effectively attracts a large, often-overlooked segment of casual fitness users, while the vast network of over 2,700 locations creates a significant barrier to entry and funds a powerful national advertising machine. However, the moat is constrained by low customer switching costs and a lack of true network effects. An upgrade to this rating would require evidence of increasing switching costs, perhaps through a more integrated digital fitness offering that creates data lock-in, or proof of a widening cost advantage over emerging low-cost competitors.

moat rating is 3 / 5
