**1) Products/Services with Long Runway**
**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Choice Hotels is executing a multi-pronged growth strategy focused on higher-revenue segments and international expansion. The company is significantly expanding its upscale and extended-stay portfolios, which command higher royalty fees. The global pipeline includes nearly 29,000 upscale rooms, a 7% quarterly increase, and the extended-stay portfolio has grown over 20% in the past five years to nearly 54,000 rooms. Furthermore, a strategic agreement in China is expected to add approximately 10,000 rooms over the next five years, tapping into a large and growing travel market.
**Answer:** Yes

**2) Commitment to Ongoing Development**
**Question:** Does management have a determination to continue to develop products or processes that will further increase total sales potential once current lines mature?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is actively investing in and developing its brand portfolio to capture new market segments and expand its customer base. The recent acquisition and integration of Radisson Hotels Americas added nine brands to their portfolio. They are also strategically developing newer brands like Everhome Suites and Cambria Hotels to increase their presence in key markets and drive brand preference. The addition of 9,500 upscale rooms to the Ascend Hotel Collection and the expansion into China underscore this commitment to developing new avenues for growth.
**Answer:** Yes

**3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size**
**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** As a hotel franchisor, Choice Hotels' R&D is focused on technology and brand development rather than traditional product R&D. The company has developed proprietary systems like choiceEDGE, a cloud-based reservation system, and choiceADVANTAGE, a property management system, to enhance franchisee operations and profitability. While specific R&D expenditures are not disclosed as a separate line item, these investments in technology infrastructure are crucial for maintaining a competitive edge and are indicative of effective development efforts relative to its business model.
**Answer:** Yes

**4) Above-Average Sales Organization**
**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's sales and marketing efforts have resulted in tangible market share gains. In Q2 2025, Choice Hotels achieved occupancy share index gains versus its competitors, indicating an effective sales strategy. The company's franchise sales organization is structured to drive growth in revenue-intense markets and chain scales. The continued growth of their franchise system, with a global pipeline of 964 hotels, further demonstrates the effectiveness of their sales organization.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)], [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ (August 6, 2025)]

**5) Worthwhile Profit Margins**
**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Choice Hotels maintains strong profit margins, characteristic of its asset-light franchise model. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2024, the company reported an operating income of $463.8 million on revenues of $1.58 billion, resulting in an operating margin of approximately 29.3%. This demonstrates the high profitability of the franchising business model, which has low variable costs associated with incremental franchise fee revenue.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)]

**6) Margin Improvement Actions**
**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Management is focused on improving margins by shifting its portfolio towards more "revenue intense" brands. The global pipeline is 98% composed of these higher-royalty brands, which are expected to generate a RevPAR premium of more than 30% compared to the existing portfolio. This strategic focus on upscale and extended-stay segments, which have higher average royalty rates and larger room counts per hotel, is a clear driver of future margin expansion.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ (August 6, 2025)]

**7) Labor & Personnel Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Choice Hotels appears to have strong labor and personnel relations, as detailed in its 2024 10-K. The company emphasizes a culture of respect and belonging and conducts annual fair pay analyses. In 2024, nearly 81% of associates participated in an engagement survey, achieving a high engagement score five points above the benchmark. The company has also received numerous awards for its workplace culture, including being named one of Newsweek's "World's Most Trustworthy Companies" in 2024.
**Answer:** Yes

**8) Executive Relations**
**Question:** Does the company have outstanding executive relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The executive team at Choice Hotels demonstrates stability and experience. The CEO, Patrick S. Pacious, has been with the company since 2005 and has served as CEO since 2017. The Chairman of the Board, Stewart W. Bainum, Jr., has a long history with the company, serving as a director from 1977 to 1996 and again since 1997. This long tenure among key leadership suggests a stable and cohesive executive team.
**Answer:** Yes

**9) Depth of Management**
**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K lists a well-rounded executive team with diverse backgrounds and extensive experience in the hospitality and related industries. Key roles such as Chief Financial Officer, Chief Global Brand Officer, and Chief Marketing Officer are filled by individuals with proven track records at major corporations like Marriott, Hilton, and Capital One. This indicates a strong bench of talent beyond the CEO, suggesting good management depth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)]

**10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls**
**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's 2024 10-K includes an unqualified audit opinion from its independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, which states that the financial statements are presented fairly in all material respects. The report also includes an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. There is no mention of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses, indicating strong accounting controls.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)]

**11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues**
**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** Choice Hotels' asset-light, franchise-focused business model is a key competitive advantage in the lodging industry. This model allows for high operating leverage and predictable cash flows, as revenues are primarily derived from royalty fees based on franchisees' gross room revenues. This insulates the company from the high fixed costs and capital commitments associated with hotel ownership, making it more resilient across economic cycles. The company's large scale, with over 7,500 hotels, provides significant network effects and brand recognition.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)]

**12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook**
**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's strategic priorities, as outlined in its 2024 10-K, demonstrate a focus on long-term profitable growth. Management emphasizes improving franchisee profitability as a key to its own success, which is a long-term strategy. The company's willingness to invest in developing new brands like Cambria and Everhome, which can be capital-intensive in the short term, and its strategic international expansion plans, also point to a long-range profit outlook.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)]

**13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk**
**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company has a strong track record of returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks rather than issuing new shares. In 2024, the company repurchased 3.0 million shares of its common stock for $369.7 million. The company's asset-light business model generates significant free cash flow, which is sufficient to fund its growth initiatives. As of December 31, 2024, the company had $699.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing capacity, indicating a strong liquidity position.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)]

**14) Candor with Investors**
**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The Q2 2025 earnings call demonstrates a degree of candor from management. They openly discussed the 2.9% decline in second-quarter results, attributing it to specific factors like reduced government and international travel, softer leisure demand, and the impact of the Easter calendar shift. They also acknowledged the macroeconomic headwinds facing the industry. A review of past earnings call transcripts on DiscountingCashFlows.com shows a consistent pattern of providing detailed explanations for both positive and negative results.
**Answer:** Yes

**15) Unquestionable Integrity**
**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** A review of the "Legal Proceedings" section of the 2024 10-K reveals that the company is "not a party to any material litigation other than litigation in the ordinary course of business." The "Risk Factors" section does not highlight any significant governance issues or related-party transactions that would raise concerns about management's integrity. The company's clean audit opinion also supports this assessment.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:** [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1046311/000104631125000007/chh-20241231.htm (February 11, 2025)]

**Synthesis (5–7 sentences):**
Choice Hotels International scores very highly on Fisher's 15-point checklist, reflecting a fundamentally strong, asset-light business with clear growth prospects. The company's strongest attributes are its profitable and resilient franchise model, its commitment to expanding into higher-margin segments like upscale and extended-stay, and its stable, experienced management team. The most significant variables that could change the score in the next 12-24 months are the successful execution of its international expansion strategy, particularly in China, and its ability to continue gaining market share in the competitive upscale segment. A sustained downturn in the travel industry could test the resilience of its franchisees and impact royalty revenues, potentially turning the "Worthwhile Profit Margins" point to a "No." Evidence of successful integration of new upscale properties and strong growth in international franchise units would solidify its high score.

**fisher score is 15 / 15**
