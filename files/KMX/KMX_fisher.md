### 1) Products/Services with Long Runway

**Question:** Does the company have products or services with sufficient market potential to make possible a sizable increase in sales for at least several years?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax is the largest retailer of used vehicles in the U.S., a highly fragmented market. In calendar year 2024, CarMax's nationwide market share of 0-10 year-old used vehicles was 3.7%, which suggests a significant opportunity for growth. The company has a long-term goal to sell more than 2 million combined retail and wholesale units annually and achieve over 5% nationwide market share. CarMax is expanding its physical footprint with new store openings and enhancing its online capabilities to create a seamless omnichannel experience for customers, aiming to attract a broader customer base.

### 3) R&D Effectiveness Relative to Size

**Question:** How effective are the company’s R&D efforts in relation to its size?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax does not explicitly report R&D expenses in its financial statements, making a direct comparison to peers difficult. However, the company's continuous investment in technology and digital infrastructure, which totaled $197 million in fiscal year 2023, can be considered a proxy for R&D. The company leverages data science, AI, and machine learning to optimize its business and customer experience, and it has scaled its data science team by more than 300% in the past 5 years. These investments have resulted in enhancements such as a new order processing system and an AI-powered virtual assistant, Skye, that independently answers over half of customer questions.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 4) Above-Average Sales Organization

**Question:** Does the company have an above-average sales organization?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's no-haggle pricing and customer-friendly sales process have distinguished it from competitors and fostered customer loyalty. The company's omni-channel sales strategy allows customers to purchase vehicles online, in-store, or through a combination of both, enhancing convenience and accessibility. In fiscal 2025, approximately 57% of retail unit sales were Omni sales. CarMax's sales consultants are generally paid commissions on a fixed dollars-per-unit standard, which aligns their interests with those of the customers.
**Answer:** Yes

### 5) Worthwhile Profit Margins

**Question:** Does the company have a worthwhile profit margin?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, CarMax achieved a record retail gross profit per used unit of $2,322. For fiscal year 2025, the gross profit margin was 12.3%, an increase from 11.6% in fiscal 2024. However, the net profit margin was 1.95% (ttm), which is relatively low. While gross margins are healthy, the net profit margin indicates that the company's operating expenses are high relative to its revenue.
**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 6) Margin Improvement Actions

**Question:** What is the company doing to maintain or improve profit margins?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax is focused on driving down its cost of sales by pursuing incremental efficiency opportunities in its logistics network and reconditioning operations.

CarMax also adjusts its vehicle acquisition costs in response to the wholesale pricing environment to manage its gross profit.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 7) Labor & Personnel Relations

**Question:** Does the company have outstanding labor and personnel relations?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax has been recognized for 21 consecutive years as one of the Fortune 100 Best Companies to Work For®.

**Answer:** No
**Citations:**

### 9) Depth of Management

**Question:** Does the company have depth to its management?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's executive team has a mix of long-tenured and newer members with diverse backgrounds in technology, finance, and retail.

**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 10) Cost Analysis & Accounting Controls

**Question:** How good are the company’s cost analysis and accounting controls?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's financial statements are audited by KPMG LLP, which has issued an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting. The company's 10-K provides detailed segment information and a breakdown of costs, indicating a good level of transparency. The Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations provides a detailed analysis of the company's performance.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 11) Industry-Specific Competitive Clues

**Question:** Are there other aspects of the business—peculiar to the industry—that give important clues about how outstanding the company may be versus competition?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's "no-haggle" pricing policy revolutionized the used car buying experience and has been a key differentiator. The company's omnichannel platform, which seamlessly integrates its online and in-store experiences, is a significant competitive advantage in the evolving automotive retail landscape. CarMax's ability to source a large portion of its inventory directly from consumers through its appraisal process provides a cost advantage and access to a desirable mix of vehicles.
**Answer:** Yes

### 12) Long-Range vs Short-Range Profit Outlook

**Question:** Does the company have a long-range outlook in regard to profits (willing to trade near-term results for durable growth)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax's decision not to offer a dividend suggests a focus on reinvesting into business expansion and innovation, which aligns with a growth-oriented approach. The company's long-term targets of selling more than 2 million combined retail and wholesale units annually and achieving over 5% nationwide market share demonstrate a long-range outlook. While facing near-term headwinds, the company continues to invest in its omnichannel platform and store expansion to drive long-term growth.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 13) Equity Financing Dilution Risk

**Question:** Is the company's financial position strong enough to fund foreseeable growth without resorting to equity financing that would meaningfully dilute existing shareholders?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax has a share repurchase program in place, which indicates that the company is not currently looking to issue new equity. The company's primary sources of liquidity are funds from operations, proceeds from non-recourse funding vehicles, and borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The company's strong free cash flow of over $565 million suggests it has the financial capacity to fund its growth initiatives without resorting to equity financing.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 14) Candor with Investors

**Question:** Does management talk freely to investors when things are going well **and** when troubles occur (i.e., no “clam up”)?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** The company's earnings call transcripts, which are publicly available, provide a platform for management to communicate with investors and analysts. In the Q1 2025 earnings call, management addressed a decline in total sales and provided context for their performance. The company's 10-K and 10-Q filings also provide a detailed discussion of the risks and challenges facing the business.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

### 15) Unquestionable Integrity

**Question:** Does the company have a management of unquestionable integrity?
**Reasoning & Evidence:** CarMax was founded on the fundamental principle of integrity. The company's "no-haggle" pricing and transparent sales process are testaments to this commitment. The browsed documents do not reveal any significant legal or regulatory issues that would question the integrity of the management.
**Answer:** Yes
**Citations:**

Synthesis: CarMax scores well on many of Fisher's points, particularly those related to its long-term growth potential, commitment to innovation, and strong company culture. The company's established brand, omnichannel strategy, and direct-from-consumer sourcing model are significant competitive advantages. The primary areas of concern are its relatively low net profit margins and the lack of detailed information on executive relations in the provided documents. The variables most likely to change the score in the next 12-24 months are the company's ability to improve its net profit margins through its cost-saving initiatives and the successful execution of its full-spectrum credit strategy. Evidence of sustained margin improvement and a clear and favorable executive compensation structure would be key to flipping the "No" answers to "Yes".

fisher score is 13 / 15
