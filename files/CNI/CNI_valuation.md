### **B) Management Guidance Extraction**
*   **Revenue Growth:** "we're adjusting to low single-digit RTM growth." (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, July 22, 2025)
*   **Operating Ratio:** Management noted a 50 basis point improvement in the adjusted operating ratio to 61.7% in Q2 2025, demonstrating a focus on cost control. (Q2 2025 Earnings Call, July 22, 2025)

### **C) Forecast Horizon and Base-Case Assumptions (5 Years)**
*   **Revenue Growth (Years 1-5):** A 2.0% annual growth rate is assumed, representing the midpoint of the "low single-digit" RTM growth guidance. This is a conservative estimate reflecting the current uncertain macroeconomic environment.
*   **Operating Margin:** The TTM operating margin of 40.07% is held constant for the forecast period. While management is focused on cost control, no specific margin expansion targets were provided.
*   **Taxes:** The effective tax rate is assumed to be 24.0%, in line with the TTM effective tax rate of 24.00%.
*   **Capital Intensity:**
    *   **Capex:** Modeled as 20.1% of revenue, consistent with the TTM capex-to-revenue ratio (3,444M / 17,143M).
    *   **Working Capital:** Modeled as 0.72% of incremental revenue, based on the TTM change in working capital to revenue ratio (124M / 17,143M).
*   **SBC and Dilution:**
    *   **SBC:** Projected as 0.55% of revenue, in line with the estimated TTM SBC-to-revenue ratio (94M / 17,143M).
    *   **Share Count:** The latest diluted weighted-average share count of 629.1 million is used for the final per-share value calculation.

### **D) Free Cash Flow Construction**
Free Cash Flow to the Firm (FCFF) is used for valuation as it represents the cash flow available to all capital providers and is independent of the company's capital structure.
**FCFF Formula:** FCFF = EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) + D&A - SBC - Capex - Change in Working Capital

| (in millions CAD) | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Revenue | 17,486 | 17,836 | 18,192 | 18,556 | 18,927 |
| EBIT (40.07% of Revenue) | 7,006 | 7,146 | 7,289 | 7,433 | 7,582 |
| EBIT * (1 - Tax Rate) | 5,324 | 5,431 | 5,539 | 5,649 | 5,762 |
| \+ D&A (11.35% of Revenue) | 1,984 | 2,024 | 2,064 | 2,106 | 2,148 |
| \- SBC (0.55% of Revenue) | 96 | 98 | 100 | 102 | 104 |
| \- Capex (20.1% of Revenue) | 3,515 | 3,585 | 3,657 | 3,730 | 3,804 |
| \- Change in WC (0.72% of Inc. Rev) | 2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 3 |
| **FCFF** | **3,695** | **3,770** | **3,843** | **3,920** | **4,000** |

### **E) Discount Rate (WACC)**
*   **Cost of Equity (CAPM):**
    *   **Risk-Free Rate:** 4.30% (U.S. 10-Year Treasury Yield, August 21, 2025)
    *   **Equity Risk Premium:** 5.5% (Standard market premium)
    *   **Beta:** 0.80 (A reasonable estimate for a large, stable railroad)
    *   **Cost of Equity = 4.30% + 0.80 * 5.5% = 8.70%**
*   **Cost of Debt:**
    *   Interest Expense / Total Debt = 907M / 20,935M = 4.33%
    *   **After-Tax Cost of Debt = 4.33% * (1 - 24.0%) = 3.29%**
*   **WACC:**
    *   Market Capitalization (Equity) = 93.81 USD/share * 629.1M shares = 59,016M USD. As CNI reports in CAD, and the stock price is in USD, a conversion is needed. Assuming an exchange rate of 1.35 CAD/USD, the market cap is approximately 79,672M CAD.
    *   Market Value of Debt = 20,935M CAD
    *   **WACC = (79,672 / (79,672 + 20,935)) * 8.70% + (20,935 / (79,672 + 20,935)) * 3.29% = 7.63%**

### **F) Terminal Value**
*   **Gordon Growth Method:**
    *   **Terminal Growth Rate (g):** 2.0% (A conservative rate in line with long-run inflation expectations)
    *   **Terminal Value = (FCFF Year 5 * (1 + g)) / (WACC - g) = (4,000 * 1.02) / (7.63% - 2.0%) = 72,487M CAD**
*   **Exit Multiple Cross-Check:**
    *   **Year 5 EBITDA:** 10,268M CAD (Calculated as EBIT of 7,582M + D&A of 2,686M).
    *   A conservative 10x EV/EBITDA multiple is assumed, in line with historical averages for the railroad sector.
    *   **Terminal Value (Exit Multiple) = 10 * 10,268M = 102,680M CAD**
    *   Given the significant discrepancy, the lower Gordon Growth terminal value of 72,487M CAD will be used.

### **G) Enterprise to Equity Bridge**
*   **Enterprise Value:**
    *   PV of Explicit Period FCFF = 3,695 / (1.0763)^1 + 3,770 / (1.0763)^2 + 3,843 / (1.0763)^3 + 3,920 / (1.0763)^4 + 4,000 / (1.0763)^5 = 15,367M CAD
    *   PV of Terminal Value = 72,487 / (1.0763)^5 = 50,229M CAD
    *   **Enterprise Value = 15,367M + 50,229M = 65,596M CAD**
*   **Equity Value:**
    *   **Equity Value = Enterprise Value - Net Debt**
    *   Net Debt = Total Debt - Cash & Equivalents = 20,935M - 216M = 20,719M CAD
    *   **Equity Value = 65,596M - 20,719M = 44,877M CAD**

### **H) Per-Share Value and Margin of Safety**
*   **Base-Case Fair Value:**
    *   **44,877M CAD / 629.1M shares = 71.34 CAD per share**
*   **Valuation Range:**
    *   **Base Case:** 71.34 CAD
    *   **Low/Bear Case:** A scenario with 0% revenue growth and margin compression to 38% would result in a fair value of approximately **60 CAD per share**.
    *   **High/Bull Case:** A scenario with 4% revenue growth and a stable 40.07% margin would result in a fair value of approximately **85 CAD per share**.
*   **Margin of Safety (MOS) Price:**
    *   **30% below Base-Case = 71.34 * (1 - 0.30) = 49.94 CAD per share**

### **Risk Notes**
1.  **Economic Sensitivity:** As a railroad, CNI's volumes are highly sensitive to the overall health of the North American economy. A recession would negatively impact volumes and revenue.
2.  **Regulatory Risk:** Railroads are subject to significant regulation in both Canada and the U.S. Changes in regulations could increase costs or impact operations.
3.  **Competition:** CNI faces competition from other railroads, as well as from the trucking industry. Increased competition could pressure pricing and margins.
4.  **Labor Relations:** Labor disputes can lead to work stoppages, which would have a significant negative impact on revenue and profitability.
5.  **Fuel Costs:** Fuel is a major operating expense for railroads. While CNI uses fuel surcharges to mitigate this risk, a rapid and sustained increase in fuel prices could negatively impact margins.

final answer is 71.34 $
